		Quick Take
A picture of a reporter in protective medical gear has fueled claims on social media accounts dedicated to American politics that the media ""hypes"" the COVID-19 pandemic. The photo actually shows a team in Lebanon reporting on a local factory that makes protective suits.
Full Story
A picture of a television reporter wearing a disposable, protective jumpsuit and face mask, while her cameraman is in regular street clothes, has been circulating on social media, prompting condemnation of the media for supposedly sensationalizing coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.
None of those posts explain that the picture is from Lebanon or that the reporter for the Al Arabiya television channel was working on a story about a factory that had just begun making the protective suits.
Instead, Facebook pages dedicated to American political issues have been posting a version of the picture paired with text that says: ""Reporter in full bio gear, Camera man in street Cloths. think the media hypes this thing a little?""
A page called Hawaii Republican Action shared it with this caption: ""The leftist government-media hype machine is in full overdrive."" And a page called America 1776 shared it with this: ""You still believe this isn’t political??""
But the picture actually came from a video taken while a reporter was filming on a street in Beirut. Another journalist posted the eight-second video clip to Twitter in March with his own commentary on the decision to wear protective gear. That video, which was posted March 18, has been viewed nearly 2 million times. 
Ghinwa Yatim, the reporter featured in the clip, responded to criticism on Twitter on March 20. She explained that she had been filming a story about a local factory that had recently begun making protective equipment and she said that during her report: ""i mentioned that there is no need to panic for the time being in Beirut, and that i was only trying this locally produced suit.""
So, while the picture does show a reporter who is covering the pandemic, many of the Facebook pages sharing it have taken it out of context.

		Q: What are the risks of the newly identified coronavirus variants?
A: It’s not yet known whether mutant versions cause more severe disease, but some are likely more contagious. Scientists expect vaccines will work but are monitoring the situation.

FULL QUESTION
Subject: COVID-19 Mutation in Colorado
I know that viruses continuously mutate, but is this new mutation that was just found stateside actually more dangerous than any other mutations of the COVID-19 virus?
FULL ANSWER
On Dec. 29, Colorado officials reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. due to a variant of the coronavirus that emerged in the U.K. in September.
Known as the B.1.1.7 lineage variant, but colloquially called the ""U.K. variant,"" the strain has spread rapidly in Britain, and scientists believe one or more of its nearly two dozen mutations have made the virus more transmissible.
A mutation is just one change to the genetic sequence. A variant usually has multiple mutations, making it a distinct virus. (To avoid stigma, we are not referring to the variants by their places of original identification.)
Meanwhile, another variant — dubbed the B.1.351 lineage variant and also referred to as 501Y.V2 — independently cropped up in October in South Africa. It shares a key mutation with B.1.1.7 and is also likely more infectious. Among numerous other genetic changes, B.1.351 has another mutation of interest that might allow it to partially evade immune responses in some people already exposed to the virus.
Researchers have also flagged another potentially concerning variant in Brazil, known as the P.1 lineage variant, that shares some of the mutations present in B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 and was observed in travelers to Japan.
There is no firm evidence yet that any of the variants cause more severe disease, although this is an active area of study.
As of Feb. 4, B.1.1.7 has been detected in 73 countries and at least 33 U.S. states, while B.1.351 has been observed in 32 nations and was first reported in the U.S. in two individuals in South Carolina. P.1 has been spotted in 11 countries. The first U.S. case was announced on Jan. 25 in a traveler returning to Minnesota from Brazil.
Before unpacking the implications of these variants for the pandemic, it’s important to emphasize that mutation itself is not surprising, as viruses mutate relatively quickly. These changes come about randomly as the pathogen replicates, making inevitable errors as the genome is copied again and again.
Variants appear all the time. ""It’s very normal,"" said Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern in Switzerland and a co-developer of the virus-tracking site Nextstrain, in an email to SciCheck.
Most mutations or collections of mutations don’t alter the virus’s biology or how human immune systems respond, although genomic scientists can track the alterations to understand how the virus is spreading. But on occasion, those types of mutations can arise and persist in populations, particularly if there is a competitive advantage for the virus.
""What causes us to take notice is when we see changes in how the virus behaves,"" Hodcroft said, ""like that one variant is expanding faster than others or than we expect.""
Even then, that’s no guarantee that a variant poses any extra threat. Over the summer, for example, Hodcroft said one variant expanded its reach across Europe, but that was mostly due to loosened restrictions and increased travel. When variants do exhibit such behavior, however, it’s worth investigating.
As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, the kinds of changes that might matter for the pandemic include those that allow the virus to:

 spread more quickly; 
increase or decrease the severity of COVID-19; 
lead existing diagnostic tests or therapeutics to fail; 
enable the virus to evade immunity resulting from natural infection or a vaccine.

With at least two variants that appear to be more contagious, scientists say concern is justified, but that the game plan remains the same: Get vaccinated and double down on public health precautions.
""The most important thing about new variants is that they still need humans in order to spread,"" Hodcroft said, ""so we can prevent them through the techniques we know work: masks, hand washing, staying home as much as possible, avoiding crowded spaces, & being aware of aerosol transmission risks.""
Nicholas Davies, an epidemiologist and assistant professor of mathematical modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who is studying coronavirus variants, echoed that call.
""It doesn’t spread in a different way, it just spreads more efficiently,"" he told us, which means sticking to the standard public health measures will still work to limit transmission.
The other piece is immunization. ""That’s really the end game for this pandemic, is getting people vaccinated,"" he said. ""And the emergence of these new variants I think makes that more important than it’s ever been.""
In a Jan. 15 report, the CDC likewise warned that with the arrival of B.1.1.7 to American shores and its increased transmissibility, the variant ""warrants universal and increased compliance with mitigation strategies, including distancing and masking,"" and said ""[h]igher vaccination coverage might need to be achieved to protect the public.""
Variant Emerged in U.K.
Of all the known SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 has garnered the most attention and study. It has an unusually high number of genetic changes and was first identified in southeastern England when public health officials were investigating a spike in COVID-19 cases in early December, with the earliest instances stemming from patient samples taken in September. 
The variant began to quickly dominate in the region and also spread to other parts of the U.K., where it replaced other viral lineages. While it is not always easy to determine whether that type of pattern necessarily means a virus has evolved to become more contagious, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told us he believed there was now a consensus that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible, noting that ""data from multiple places in the UK are compelling.""
The most direct evidence of an increase in transmissibility comes from contact tracing data, Davies said. Public Health England found that as of Dec. 20, 14.7% of those in contact with people infected with B.1.1.7 contracted COVID-19, compared with 11% for those not infected with the variant.
Researchers also have used modeling or other statistical techniques to estimate how much more infectious B.1.1.7 is. Davies’ group, for instance, pegged B.1.1.7 as 56% more infectious than preexisting versions of the virus in a preliminary, unpublished preprint released at the end of December.
Scientists at Imperial College London also released an unpublished report that estimated the variant increased the reproduction number, or how many people on average each person with COVID-19 infects, by 0.4 to 0.7.
Davies said that while it’s hard to pin down an exact estimate — the numbers vary based on the models — B.1.1.7 is likely somewhere between 30% and 70% more contagious.
Preliminary data from the National Health Service initially suggested that B.1.1.7 does not cause more severe COVID-19 compared with past versions of the virus, as there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of people infected with the variant who were hospitalized or died within 28 days compared with those infected with other strains.
Subsequently, however, British authorities revealed on Jan. 22 that four analyses indicated there was a ""realistic possibility"" that B.1.1.7 could be more lethal, although they cautioned that this was based on limited data and was still uncertain.
Even if B.1.1.7 doesn’t cause more severe COVID-19 symptoms, experts caution that an increase in transmissibility can still lead to a large number of deaths. In fact, because of the exponential nature of viral spread, an increase in contagiousness can have a bigger effect than the same uptick in a virus’s virulence, or ability to harm a host.
Running the math on a hypothetical virus with similar characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 in a city with 10,000 infections, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine mathematician and infectious disease researcher Adam Kucharski explained on Twitter that a variant that’s 50% more deadly would eventually kill 64 additional people after a month, but a variant that’s 50% more transmissible would claim an extra 849 lives.
Of B.1.1.7’s 23 mutations, 17 change the protein sequence and eight of these occur in the virus’s spike — the protein that sticks out from the surface and is used to enter human cells.
Specifically, B.1.1.7 has a mutation known as N501Y (the name refers to a change in the protein sequence at position 501 from the amino acid asparagine to tyrosine). This is of particular note because it occurs in the receptor binding domain — the spot on the spike that binds to the ACE2 receptor on human cells — and previous experiments suggest it enables the virus to bind to the human receptor more tightly. A study in mice also found that making this change allowed the animals to be more easily infected and to get sick.
Other mutations of interest include a short deletion that is predicted to alter the shape of the spike protein and another change near an enzyme-binding site that could affect how the virus enters cells.
While the mechanism for why B.1.1.7 is more contagious still needs to be studied, tighter binding to human cells — due to the N501Y mutation or perhaps in combination with other mutations — could account for the phenomenon.
""As you breathe in some virus, if the virus is more efficient at latching on to its target surface, you’re more likely to get an infection,"" explained Shane Crotty, an infectious disease researcher who studies COVID-19 at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, in an interview with the YouTube channel MedCram.
Crotty also pointed to preliminary work from a governmental lab in the U.K. indicating that people infected with B.1.1.7 had higher viral loads, or levels of the virus, in their noses than people harboring other strains. 
""If that’s true, it would say that this U.K. variant has amassed a set of mutations that let it grow a lot better in nasal passages than the previous virus and that there’s literally just a lot more virus in people’s nose,"" he said. ""If there’s just more virus coming out of you when you’re breathing or sneezing or coughing, then obviously it’s going to be more likely to able to infect people near you.""
So far, B.1.1.7 remains rare in the U.S., and it does not explain the surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations that began in the fall.
Duncan MacCannell, the chief science officer with the CDC’s Office of Advanced Molecular Detection, told the Washington Post on Jan. 11 that he estimated that only 0.5% of COVID-19 transmission in the country involves the variant.
But many scientists expect the proportion of COVID-19 cases due to the variant will rise. 
Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist studying viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and co-developer of Nextstrain, said in a Jan. 7 interview with NPR that based on the timeframe observed in the U.K., he thought B.1.1.7 could become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March.
CDC modeling, shared in a Jan. 15 report from the agency, similarly concluded that B.1.1.7 could become the predominant variant in the month of March.
Variant Identified in South Africa
Compared with its U.K. counterpart, less is known about B.1.351, which was first observed in South Africa. In a preprint posted on Dec. 22, scientists noted that the variant quickly came to be the dominant virus in the country’s two most southern provinces and might be more transmissible.
Few research groups have attempted to quantify the variant’s possible increase in contagiousness, although one tentatively estimated it to be 50% more infectious, with a range between 20% and 113%.
According to the same unpublished report, the case fatality ratio did rise in the region as the variant took over, suggesting a possible effect on disease severity, but there is no firm evidence that B.1.351 is more deadly than ancestral viruses.
Davies, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine epidemiologist who also co-authored the preprint, explained that the proportion of people dying could have gone up for a variety of reasons unrelated to a change in viral virulence.
""When hospitals are under more pressure the standard of care that they’re able to provide tends to go down,"" he said. ""So it could be, for example, that because [the variant is] more transmissible, they’re seeing more cases, and they’re less able to treat the people coming in.""
B.1.351 harbors multiple mutations in its spike protein, three of which occur in the receptor binding domain. This includes N501Y — the key mutation in B.1.1.7 — and another one nearby, E484K. 
E484K is especially noteworthy, as researchers have found that the mutation reduces the ability of antibodies collected from people who recovered from COVID-19 to neutralize the virus. This raises concerns that the variant could pose more of a risk to populations because it could be better at reinfecting people and vaccines might not work as well against the variant.
Most scientists, however, caution against assuming the worst. As Jesse Bloom, a researcher who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center whose lab performed the antibody experiments, explained on Twitter, there is no reason to think that all immunity would be lost or that existing vaccines would suddenly fail.
""I’m confident current vaccines will be useful for quite a while,"" he said, noting that the E484K mutation only reduced the neutralization activity of the antibodies present in some people’s blood, and didn’t eliminate it for anyone.
""So we need to monitor these mutations, and be prepared to update vaccines eventually if needed,"" he added. But, he said, less effective neutralizing antibodies, ""while worrying,"" are ""not the same as complete elimination of all immunity.""
Indeed, Moderna announced on Jan. 25 that the antibodies collected from people immunized with its vaccine were still able to neutralize a virus with the full set of spike mutations present in the B.1.351 variant, but it took around six times more antibody to do so than for previous versions of the virus. The results have not yet been peer reviewed, but were posted in a preprint to bioRxiv in collaboration with researchers at the National Institutes of Health.
Although in theory the N501Y mutation, by virtue of being located where it is on the spike protein, might also be a concern for immune evasion, experiments thus far have not revealed any problems. 
Bloom’s lab, for example, did not find that mutations in N501 strongly diminished the ability of any person’s antibodies to bind to the virus. A similar test on antibodies from 20 people vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also found no reduction in the ability of those antibodies to neutralize a virus with the N501Y mutation, according to an unpublished report conducted by scientists at the University of Texas in collaboration with Pfizer.
Public Health England also reported on Jan. 14 that antibodies from people infected with non-B.1.1.7 viruses still neutralized the variant, and vice-versa.
Other experiments from the vaccine makers likewise suggest B.1.1.7 is unlikely to pose a problem for the current shots. As detailed in a report published in the journal Science, Pfizer found that antibodies from people immunized with its vaccine could neutralize a virus with B.1.1.7’s full set of spike mutations almost as well as an unmutated virus. Moderna reported similar findings for its vaccine on Jan. 25.
The good news is that should any variant prove to be evading a vaccinated person’s immune response, the two COVID-19 vaccines with emergency authorization in the U.S. can be quickly modified. Both use messenger RNA to train the immune system to recognize SARS-CoV-2, which can be revised by swapping in a molecule with a slightly different sequence.
Recent Variant in Brazil
Relatively little is known about the P.1 lineage variant, which a group of scientists first named in a Jan. 12 post on a virology discussion forum. Similar to the situation in the U.K. and South Africa, the variant was identified following a surge of COVID-19 cases, this time in Manaus, Brazil.
Although P.1 arose independently, it shares several genetic changes with the other variants of concern, including N501Y and E484K.

		Quick Take
Viral social media posts and videos have falsely claimed that ""martial law [is] imminent"" in the U.S. Those bogus reports are being pushed in some cases by those who sell emergency and survivalist products.

Full Story
President Donald Trump mobilized the National Guard on March 22 in Washington, California and New York — three states that have been hit hard by COVID-19 — to assist with everything from distribution of food to set-up of medical tents.
The following day, Defense Secretary Mark Esper clarified: ""To be clear, this is not a move toward martial law, as some have erroneously claimed.""
Esper was responding to persistent online rumors that martial law is either currently in place or very near.
Generally, martial law is military authority substituted for civil government during periods of unrest. It’s a murky concept that hasn’t been defined in American law — as we’ll explain later.
As for the rumors hyping the idea that military rule is looming, the Facebook page for ""Alternative Media Television"" recently warned its more than 145,000 followers: ""STORM IS COMING TO AMERICA!!!! MARTIAL LAW NEXT 24 HOURS!!!!!!""
That post linked to Alternative Media Television’s online store, which sells ""emergency survival"" gear and ""emergency preparedness"" food supplies.
Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind the website Infowars.com, also has been pumping out misinformation on the issue while selling his own survivalist supplies, including face masks.
""We are already under overlying fields, crisscrossing fields, of martial law,"" Jones said in one recent video.
Jones was banned from Facebook in 2019 for violating the company’s policies on ""dangerous individuals and organizations,"" but he still maintains a website and posts videos to his own video-sharing platform. The video warning of martial law was viewed more than 100,000 times, according to metrics shown on the site.
Another conspiracy theorist who hawks doomsday preparation goods online, David Zublick, has claimed on his website and YouTube channel that ""this is, basically, martial law.""
But that’s not true.
There has been no declaration of martial law nationally or in any state as of March 25.
In fact, Federal Emergency Management Administrator Peter Gaynor said at a briefing with the president’s coronavirus task force on March 22, ""we’ve had a lot of disinformation circulating and I want to make sure that it’s understood that this is not martial law."" 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also has said he won’t institute martial law, and the Washington National Guard issued a statement on Twitter saying, ""Let’s put aside the rumors about martial law or military rule. IT’S JUST NOT TRUE.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he didn’t expect martial law would be necessary, but acknowledged that it’s an option.
At a March 15 press briefing, a reporter noted that other states had been more forceful in closing down businesses and asked, ""why not exercise your authority?"" Newsom answered by saying: ""[I]f you want to establish a framework of martial law, which is ultimate authority and enforcement, we have the capacity to do that, but we are not, at this moment, feeling that is a necessity.""
Newsom may have been referring to his powers under the state’s Emergency Services Act. His office didn’t respond to a request for clarification, but a spokesman for the governor’s office, Brian Ferguson, has reportedly said: ""We don’t want this to be scary for people. This is a humanitarian mission to support health and safety.""
So, martial law isn’t in effect and it’s not imminent. But it’s worth explaining what, exactly, this ill-defined term means.
The U.S. Supreme court summed it up in a 1946 decision stemming from martial law in Hawaii during World War II.
U.S. Supreme Court, 1946: [T]he term ‘martial law’ carries no precise meaning. The Constitution does not refer to ‘martial law’ at all and no Act of Congress has defined the term. It has been employed in various ways by different people and at different times. By some it has been identified as ‘military law’ limited to members of, and those connected with, the armed forces. Others have said that the term does not imply a system of established rules but denotes simply some kind of day to day expression of a General’s will dictated by what he considers the imperious necessity of the moment… In 1857 the confusion as to the meaning of the phrase was so great that the Attorney General in an official opinion had this to say about it: ‘The Common Law authorities and commentators afford no clue to what martial law, as understood in England, really is. * * * In this country it is still worse.’ 8 Op.Atty.Gen. 365, 367. What was true in 1857 remains true today.
Basically, martial law is the temporary replacement of civil government by the military during a period of unrest, explained David Glazier, a professor at Loyola Law School and former U.S. Navy officer.
It has rarely been used in the U.S., said William Banks, professor of law at Syracuse University. The last time was in Hawaii, when martial law was instituted following the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Before that, martial law had been declared a couple of times by governors in the early 20th century, Banks and Glazier said. Also, President Abraham Lincoln used it during the Civil War and General Andrew Jackson used it in New Orleans during the War of 1812.
Post World War II, some circumstances have been mischaracterized as martial law, particularly civil rights-era actions, as when President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the National Guard in Arkansas to integrate schools in Little Rock. President John F. Kennedy did the same in Mississippi, and President Lyndon Johnson acted similarly to protect demonstrators marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama.
All of those actions were taken under the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to use the military to quell unrest.
But that’s the opposite of martial law, which exists only if there is no civil law. In those cases, ""It’s entirely authorized by the law. That’s the point,"" said Banks.
Geoffrey Corn, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston and a former Army officer, put it another way — those cases used the military to supplement civil law.
A much more common supplemental use of the National Guard is for help with humanitarian aid and law enforcement during natural disasters, Corn said.
Still, it can be confusing to the public to see signs of military presence in their communities.
For example, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, was recently prompted to respond to a viral tweet showing a video clip of military vehicles that suggested they were an ominous sign of things to come.
""[T]hese are new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles being transported by @USArmy Materiel Command from the factory in Oshkosh to Fort Bragg, NC. These deliveries by train to our bases nationwide are not infrequent and have nothing to do w COVID-19,"" Hoffman tweeted.
But another post from Alternative Media Television had already amplified the misconception, claiming: ""BREAKING!!! MILITARY VEHICLES MOVING INTO MAJOR CITIES!!! MARTIAL LAW IMMINENT!!"" The video accompanying that post has been viewed more than 225,000 times.
In order to have martial law, Corn told us, there would need to be a complete breakdown of civil institutions. ""As long as civil function continues,"" Corn said, the courts will find ""invocation of martial law is unconstitutional.""
The other experts we talked to agreed that national-scale martial law is exceedingly unlikely.
""There’s no case whatsoever that civil authority has collapsed or come close to collapsing,"" said Robert Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin Law School, explaining that there is no cause for instituting the ""almost comically draconian step of martial law.""

		Quick Take
A post circulating on social media falsely claims that a blend of sodium bicarbonate and lemon juice will ""eliminate"" the novel coronavirus. The post also claims this ""cure"" has prevented any COVID-19 deaths in Israel — but more than 30 people have died of the disease there.

Full Story
As COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, spreads around the world, numerous false and misleading claims of ""cures"" for the virus are spreading on social media.
A recent claim is from a post titled ""In Israel No Death from COVID 19.""  It falsely states that the ""cure"" for COVID-19, ""or the way to eliminate it,"" has been discovered, and that it comes from Israel, where it says the virus ""did not cause any death.""
In reality, as of April 2, more than 6,800 people in Israel have tested positive for COVID-19, and 36 have died. Over 100 people were in serious condition and 83 were on life support.
The post also claims that this ""cure"" is the reason that the ""People of Israel is relaxed"" about COVID-19.
Actually, the Israeli government has issued emergency regulations that include reducing entry to the public space, imposing responsibility on employers, closing non-essential stores and imposing restrictions on public transport, as well as ""home isolation"" guidelines.
The post’s ""recipe"" for the phony cure includes lemon and bicarbonate — short for sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which is commonly used as an antacid.
""Mix and drink as hot tea every afternoon,"" the post says. ""The action of the lemon with hotter baking soda immediately kills the virus [and] completely eliminates it from the body.""
This claim is baseless. According to the World Health Organization, ""to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.""
Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician and fellow with the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, confirmed this in an interview.
""There’s no data that shows using lemon juice or hot tea or anything like that would kill a virus,"" she said.
Angela Rogers, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center, noted in an email that ""there is nothing that has been shown yet to kill or eliminate COVID-19 virus, and it’s still not clear whether any other therapies in the news (steroids, targeted immune modulators, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine) are actually helpful.""
Kuppalli said people can lower their risk of contracting the virus by washing their hands, covering their coughs and sneezes, maintaining distance from each other, and following public health measures that have been implemented in their area.

		Experts say there is no evidence that Black Lives Matter protests or Mexicans have caused the spike in coronavirus cases in pockets of the U.S., contradicting President Donald Trump’s assertions.
In a press briefing on July 21, Trump acknowledged cases were rising in some parts of the country and, ""It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better."" In another press briefing the following day, Trump noted that cases are rising in parts of the South and Southwest and the West. Trump offered this assessment of the reasons why:
Trump, July 22: There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations — which you know very well about — which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide. And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.
Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places — maybe beaches — four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide — likely also contributed.
We’re also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the president, and it’s a big problem for Mexico. But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
Despite Trump mentioning the protests that followed the death of George Floyd and cases rising in Mexico, experts told us there is no evidence either of those is responsible for the spike in cases around the country. Rather, they said, it is a result of some states reopening too quickly or aggressively, without proper measures in place to test, trace and isolate cases, and people generally socializing in ways that epidemiologists had warned would result in the spread of the virus.
Protests
Many epidemiologists feared that the protests in honor of Floyd — a Black man who died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck during an arrest in Minneapolis on May 25  — would trigger a jump in coronavirus cases.
Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told us in a phone interview that he was concerned about large groups of protesters in close quarters screaming and chanting, and in some cases hit with tear gas that would make them cough — things that can contribute to virus spread. But the feared spike in infections never panned out, he said. 
""There has been no evidence that protests led to a significant increase in infections,"" Adalja said.
While there have been some cases that have emerged among law enforcement in particular, he said, ""It hasn’t been very big."" Any increase, he said, ""has been minimal, at best.""
""It really hasn’t had a significant impact on the increases we’re seeing in certain states,"" he said.
Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch concurs.
""To my knowledge there is no evidence that the spike in cases can be attributed to protests,"" Lipsitch told us via email. ""While I and other epidemiologists have noted the likelihood that some transmissions would likely occur at protests, my understanding is that when testing facilities were opened for those who had been at large gatherings, positivity was very low or even zero among those who came — probably because the protests were outdoors and largely masked.""
In a June working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists concluded there was ""no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset."" The paper, which is not peer-reviewed, further concluded ""predictions of broad negative public health consequences of Black Lives Matter protests were far too narrowly conceived.""
The researchers said their analysis of 315 U.S. cities provided ""strong evidence"" that as a result of protests, non-protesters generally stayed home more, resulting in a net benefit with regard to spread of the coronavirus.
""Event-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that non-protesters’ behavior was substantially affected by urban protests,"" the authors wrote. ""This effect was not fully explained by the imposition of city curfews. Estimated effects were generally larger for persistent protests and those accompanied by media reports of violence.""
Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center, told us via email he was ""not aware of evidence that outdoors protests have fueled COVID outbreaks to a significant degree.""
Mexico
Nor did the experts we contacted believe there is any validity to Trump’s assertion that Mexico has contributed to the rise of cases in the U.S.
""The role of Mexican migrants is utterly without foundation, and surely can’t explain upsurges in the Southeast, Northern California, and many other parts of the country,"" Lipsitch told us.
On March 21, Mexico and the U.S. jointly restricted nonessential land travel between the two countries to prevent spread of the coronavirus. Nonessential travel includes travel that is considered tourism or recreation. At least one Mexican state completely closed its border with the U.S. ahead of the July 4 holiday, fearing spread of the virus from the U.S. into Mexico.
Statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that apprehensions of people crossing the Mexican border illegally into the U.S. have been relatively low in the first half of 2020 compared with 2019.
Trump suggested that a rise in coronavirus cases in the Southwest may be due, in part, to the U.S. sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico — where he said cases are ""surging."" But Adalja said that is likely ""mere coincidence,"" considering that states like Florida, Delaware and some in the Midwest are not border states, and yet have also seen spikes in coronavirus infections.
""I don’t think there’s any evidence that Mexico has anything to do with case increases and hospitalization increases in those areas [along the border],"" Adalja said. ""There’s no evidence of that.""
""It is possible that some infected people may cross borders, but that could probably work in both directions,"" Goodman told us. ""Again, I’m not aware it is a significant contributor to the U.S. upswing which has generally correlated with relaxation of social distancing.""
Causes Trump Didn’t Mention
Several of the things mentioned by Trump were contributors to the spike in coronavirus cases around the country, experts said, such as people ignoring social distancing recommendations and gathering in bars, and people traveling more for vacation.
The main reason for the spike is fairly obvious, Adalja told us.
""The virus never went anywhere,"" he said. When the stay-at-home orders were lifted, it was inevitable that there would be spread.
People began to interact. They went to bars. They gathered at events, often not wearing masks.
The increase was predictable, he said, especially since some states had not prepared the necessary infrastructure to do proper testing, tracing and isolation to control outbreaks.
""What has consistently been clear is that the most stringent control measures have been in the Northeast and these have been the states with the best control over case and death numbers; government policies and individual decisions about reopening and not masking are clearly the main causes of upsurges in the U.S.,"" Lipsitch said.
Not mentioned by Trump is the belief among many scientists — including some on the president’s own task force — that some states opened too quickly and aggressively.
""Yeah, then there are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a FiveThirtyEight podcast on July 9.
Fauci also attributed the spike to a general attitude among some U.S. residents, ""You know, well, I’m either going to be locked down or I’m going to let it all rip.""
In a press gaggle on July 22, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said ""some of these states blew through our gated criteria, blew through our phases, and they opened up some of the industries a little too quickly, like bars.""
Conway then engaged in revisionist history when she added, ""So remember, the governors wanted complete latitude over when they would open their states. They pushed back heavily, handsomely, Republicans and Democrats, when it was falsely rumored that the president was going to be in charge of opening the states. He’s a federalist. He believes in states’ rights.""
In fact, Trump was a strong cheerleader for reopening, and repeatedly — and wrongly — claimed that he, not governors, had the ultimate authority to open up states.
In April, Trump admonished Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for opening ""too soon."" But he also chastised states with Democratic governors who he thought were being too strict, calling via Twitter to ""LIBERATE"" Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia.
He has also praised the reopening efforts by some Republican governors, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who he said has done a ""fantastic job"" responding to the coronavirus, even as Fauci singled out Florida for ""jump[ing] over a couple of checkpoints"" and opening too quickly. On July 23, Florida broke its record for the highest single-day death toll.
The U.S. has now had 4 million people test positive for COVID-19 – including 1 million in the last 15 days, as the COVID Tracking Project data shows. For the second straight day, the U.S. recorded more than 1,100 daily deaths, on July 22 and 23, and now has had more than 143,000 total deaths.
Epidemiologists say there are a number of reasons for the recent spike in cases around the country, but there is no evidence that Black Lives Matter protests and a surge of cases in Mexico have been major contributors.

		President Donald Trump has repeatedly misstated the facts at the White House coronavirus briefings.
In this video, we feature five examples from our story ""An April Filled With Repeats.""

Not a ""travel ban."" At least four times in April, the president said he had imposed a ""travel ban"" on China or ""closed the border."" But the Trump administration’s travel restrictions stopped well short of a ""ban."" The policy, which took effect Feb. 2, prohibits non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S., but the new rules don’t apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members. 
Misleading claims of a ""broken system."" Throughout April, Trump repeatedly claimed he had ""inherited a broken system"" of testing from previous administrations. Once, he referred to it as a ""broken test."" As we explained, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alone couldn’t conduct the amount of testing this pandemic demanded, but it was never designed for that — a point Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has made. ""The CDC designed a good system."" Fauci said on March 13. ""If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector.""
Not the ""greatest economy."" On 11 occasions in April, Trump said that the United States had ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before it was shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. On April 10, he also used a variation, ""the greatest economy ever created,"" and on April 4, he settled for the more modest ""greatest economy in the world."" Under Trump, the economy was in good shape, but it has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real annual economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 2.9% 19 times, including once under President Barack Obama.
Pushing an unproven treatment. On at least five occasions in April, Trump made false and misleading claims about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, while downplaying the antimalarial drug’s risks. The president said that hydroxychloroquine is ""looking like it’s having some good results,"" even after Fauci cautioned that there was only anecdotal evidence. Trump claimed that ""there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus,"" when in fact there is no such study and lupus patients do contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. And he claimed ""malaria countries … have very little of this virus,"" citing nonexistent ""studies."" We found that hydroxychloroquine is not widely used for malaria in much of the world. On April 8, Trump said his administration had purchased ""30 million doses"" of hydroxychloroquine based on ""a lot of good stories"" and ""some very good results"" that the drug worked against COVID-19. But by April 24, the FDA issued a warning against using ""hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.""
Strategic National Stockpile wasn’t ""empty."" Trump has frequently claimed — falsely — that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies was ""empty"" or ""bare"" when he took office. The government does not disclose the exact counts of the stockpile’s contents, but, as of 2016, the year before Trump took office, there were at least six warehouses holding ""approximately $7 billion in products across more than 900 separate line items,"" according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

		2Summary
As President Joe Biden takes office, he inherits:

The worst disease outbreak in over a century, which is spreading faster and killing more people in the U.S. than at any time since it began one year ago.
Highly effective vaccines that so far have reached only 4% of the public.
An economy struggling with 10 million jobless and millions more out of the workforce.
A rising tide of murders — up nearly 36% last year in major cities.
Federal debt the highest since World War II, as a percentage of the U.S. economy, and an annual deficit running at $2.3 trillion this year — even before Biden asks for a $1.9 trillion aid package.
More monthly illegal border crossings from Mexico than before Donald Trump took office, despite 453 miles of new or upgraded barriers along the nearly 2,000-mile line.

These are some of the numbers by which the future successes or failures of the new president will be measured.
Analysis
COVID-19
The Disease — Biden takes office exactly one year after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the United States on Jan. 20, 2020.
The virus is still raging out of control, killing thousands more people in the U.S. each day. According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 174,589 new confirmed cases were added yesterday alone, and 2,727 deaths. That brings the total U.S. death toll to more than 401,000.
The U.S. has so far done poorly at controlling the virus compared with other nations. In fact, it leads all other countries in the number of COVID-19 deaths. The U.S. has less than 4.3% of the world’s population but accounts for 19.5% of worldwide COVID-19 fatalities. Relative to size of population, the U.S. death rate from the disease is the 10th highest among the 237 countries tracked by the World Health Organization.
The Vaccines — Two very effective vaccines against the virus that causes COVID-19 were approved for emergency use in the U.S. about a month before Biden took office. Pfizer-BioNTech got its authorization Dec. 11 and Moderna’s came a week later on Dec. 18. Since then at least 13.6 million Americans have gotten one or more shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes 2 million who have received the full two-dose regimen required for maximum effectiveness.
But there’s a long way to go. So far only 4% of the population has received a first shot. Although experts are still studying the question, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimates that half the population needs to be vaccinated ""before you start to see an impact"" and 75% to 85% need to have the vaccine to achieve the sort of ""herd immunity"" that makes polio and measles the rarities they are today.
Biden has pledged to give another 100 million shots during his first 100 days. But even if that ambitious goal is achieved, it would still fall far short — as of the end of April — of the levels Fauci says are required to begin slowing the spread of the virus.
There were nearly 257 million U.S. residents aged 18 and over in the U.S. as of July 1, according to the most recent Census estimate. (No vaccine is yet authorized for children under 16.) Since two shots are required, the Biden goal would bring the total fully vaccinated to about 56 million or so, or possibly a few million more if Johnson & Johnson gets emergency authorization for its single-shot vaccine, which is still in phase 3 clinical trials.
Jobs and Unemployment
As Biden takes office the economy is struggling and job growth has stalled.
Employment — After losing 22.1 million jobs in March and April, the economy regained 12.1 million from May through November — but then lost 140,000 jobs in December.
The number of Americans employed in December was 142 million, or 3 million fewer than when Donald Trump became president and 9.8 million below the pre-recession peak in February.
Unemployment —  The unemployment rate stood at 6.7% last month — well above the historical norm of 5.6%, which is the median rate for all months since 1948.
The number of people officially listed as unemployed stood at 10.7 million in December, about where it was just over seven years earlier when the nation was recovering from the Great Recession of 2007-2009.
And the rate would be even higher but for the fact that 3.9 million people have stopped looking for work since February and are no longer part of the labor force. The unemployment rate is the percentage of those adults in the labor force who have looked for work in the previous four weeks.
That exodus pushed the labor force participation rate down to 61.5% in December, which is 1.3 percentage points lower than it had been when Trump took over from President Barack Obama. That rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks.
Economic Growth
Biden inherits an economy not yet fully recovered from the deep recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even before the recession, growth was relatively modest — real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product grew 2.2% in 2019, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, down from 3.0% the year before, which was the best year of Trump’s tenure.
But last year’s GDP was almost certainly negative, wiping out all or nearly all of the previous year’s growth.
The first official estimate of 2020’s year-to-year growth is scheduled for release Jan. 28, and there’s wide agreement that it will be negative. Members of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Bank presidents believe the economy shrank in 2020. Their median forecast, issued Dec. 16, was for a 2.4% decline relative to 2019, with estimates ranging from minus 1.0% to minus 3.3%. The more than 60 private sector economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal this month put the 2020 decline on average at 2.5%.
Most (73%) of the 48 economic forecasters surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics said they believe the economy won’t recover to pre-COVID-19 levels until the second half of 2021.
Crime
Biden takes office with murder rates soaring across the nation, in cities, small towns and rural areas alike.
The number of homicides in the U.S. went down 0.7% in 2017 and 5.3% in 2018, then increased 0.3% in 2019 and began to surge early last year.
The FBI announced Sept. 15 that a preliminary report showed a 14.8% increase in the number of homicides during the first six months of last year, compared with the same period the year before.
That murder spike worsened as the year wore on. On Dec. 15, the FBI published, without any press release or news conference, preliminary figures for the first nine months of the year, showing a 20.9% increase in homicides nationwide, compared with the same period in 2019.
The wave of killing swept over cities large and small. Homicides went up 29.3% in cities with 1 million or more in population, 31.1% in cities of under 10,000 and 9.5% in metropolitan counties.
The FBI’s nationwide report for all of 2020 won’t be available for months. However, New Orleans-based data analyst Jeff Asher reports a nearly 36% increase in the number of homicides last year in 58 major cities that publish their crime statistics.
Wages and Inflation
Biden enters office with inflation under control and the buying power of the average weekly paycheck rising.
CPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 1.3% during the 12 months ending in December, continuing a long period of low inflation.
Last year’s figure was held down by a plunge in gasoline prices and the pandemic-triggered economic recession. But CPI rose only 2.3% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2018. The average yearly increase over the past decade is 1.7%.
Wages — For those who still get them, paychecks are growing faster than prices.
The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in ""real"" (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 4.7% during the 12 months ending in December — at least for those lucky enough to still be working.
The size of that sharp rise is to some degree a statistical fluke. The 2020 pandemic hit workers in low-wage industries harder than others, pulling up the overall average.
But real wage gains generally have been increasing since hitting a low point in July 2008 at the worst of the Great Recession. They rose 1.2% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018 and inched up 0.1% in 2019, for example.
Poverty — The poverty rate that Biden inherits can’t yet be pinned down. The pandemic recession hurt low-income people more than others, but massive federal aid also was concentrated on offsetting that impact to some extent. The Census Bureau won’t even collect 2020 income and poverty figures until later this year and normally releases them in September, so we’ll have to wait.
Even then the picture may remain clouded. The 2019 statistics were distorted by the pandemic, which hit just as Census survey-takers were trying to collect data. More people than usual failed to respond, and Census researchers later figured that low-income people failed to answer the survey more often than others, pushing up reported income figures and pushing down the number thought to be in poverty. Census researchers wrote that for 2019, ""we estimate a poverty rate of 11.1 percent"" of the population, or about 36 million people.
Debt and Deficits
Biden inherits the biggest federal debt since World War II, and a treasury hemorrhaging trillions more in each year.
Debt — The amount the federal government has borrowed from the public stood at over $21.6 trillion at last report on Jan. 15. That’s more than 50% higher than it was only four years ago, and growing fast.
The size of the debt in dollars is easily highest in history. It’s also pushing toward a record level when measured against the size of the economy.
The debt at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, stood at 100.1% of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to the 2021 Economic Report of the President, just released Jan. 15. Debt has only been higher than that twice in history, in 1945 (103.9% of GDP) and 1946 (106.1%).
Deficit — Federal spending outpaced revenues by a record $3.1 trillion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. In the current fiscal year the deficit is on a course to hit $2.3 trillion even before Biden has signed a single bill.
Biden plans to make that even larger, saying he will seek a $1.9 trillion package to fight the pandemic and its economic effects. He may not get all of that. His party controls both the House and Senate only by slender margins.
Immigration
The Wall — On his way to Texas on Jan. 12, Trump boasted that his administration had fulfilled his signature 2016 campaign promise and ""completed the wall"" on the southern border. Once at the border, Trump said he had given Customs and Border Protection ""100% of what you wanted."" As we wrote, none of that is accurate.
But the border barrier is still significantly more robust than when Trump took office. In total, 453 miles of ""border wall system"" was constructed during the Trump administration, according to a CBP status report on Jan. 8. Most of that, 373 miles of it, is replacement for primary or secondary fencing that was dilapidated or of outdated design. In addition, 47 miles of new primary wall and 33 miles of secondary wall have been built in locations where there were no barriers before.
Since the land border itself is 1,954 miles long, according to the US-Mexico International Boundary and Water Commission, the new fencing constructed by Trump covers just over 20% of the southwest border. Together with what existed before Trump took office, there are now about 701 miles of barriers along the southwest border, about 36% of the total border.
Biden inherits funding in place to construct another 234 miles of barriers where none existed before, though the new president has said he does not plan to build any more wall.
According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ estimates reviewed by the Washington Post, there will be about $3.3 billion in unused border barrier funding when Biden takes office. If Biden immediately stops construction as promised, it would cost the U.S. about $700 million to terminate those contracts, saving the U.S. government about $2.6 billion.
Apprehensions — In his speech from the border in Texas on Jan. 12, Trump said illegal crossings have ""absolutely plummeted"" due to his wall construction.
Border apprehensions spiked in fiscal year 2019, and then fell by about half in fiscal 2020, which ended on Sept. 30. It is impossible to tease out how much of that drop may be as a result of the new barriers constructed under Trump, but a Pew Research Center report documenting the decline attributed it mostly to a worldwide decrease in the movement of migrants due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and governments fully or partially closing their borders as a result.
But apprehensions/expulsions have crept back up in recent months, and so Biden inherits monthly apprehension levels that are higher than what Trump inherited. Southwest border apprehensions and expulsions for October, November and December, the first three months of fiscal year 2021, are higher than the three months before Trump took office.
Political Polarization
Biden, who has promised to reach out to Republicans in an effort to bring the country together, takes office amid a time of significant political polarization.  
Most recently, a CNN/SSRS poll released Jan. 17, but conducted between Jan. 9 and 14, shows that 75% of Republicans don’t believe Biden’s election win was legitimate, compared with 1% of Democrats and 31% of independents and others who feel the same way. Just 19% of Republicans polled said Biden won legitimately, compared with 99% of Democrats and 66% of others, including independents.
Also, studies show that the tendency of Democrats and Republicans to dislike and distrust members of the other party has been rising for decades.
As of September 2019, for example, a Pew Research Center survey revealed that the share of Republicans who gave Democrats a ""cold"" rating, 0-49 on a ""feeling thermometer"" scale, was up to 83%, 25 percentage points higher than the 58% who did so in December 2016 — not long before Trump was inaugurated. Similarly, the share of Democrats who gave Republicans the same rating had increased to 79%, up from 56% nearly three years earlier.
Furthermore, the same survey found that 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats said that voters in both parties ""not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on the basic facts."" Almost half of both parties (53% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats) said the other has almost no good ideas. And when putting politics aside, 61% of Republicans and 54% of Democrats still said members of the opposing party don’t share their same values and goals.
But there was perhaps at least one positive from a Pew preelection survey in October last year: ""Majorities of both Trump (86%) and Biden (89%) supporters say that their preferred candidate, if elected, should focus on addressing the needs of all Americans, ‘even if it means disappointing some of his supporters.’""
Editor’s Note: We usually produce a quarterly report called ""Trump’s Numbers"" in January. But the books aren’t closed on the Trump presidency just yet, so we will do a final accounting later this year.

There is no evidence that vaccines could cause harm to people who already have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or have become ill with the disease COVID-19. On the contrary, recent studies show the vaccine gives an important immunity boost to those previously infected and suggest that one dose might be enough. 

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How effective are the vaccines?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How effective are the vaccines?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

Full Story
The authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been found to be safe and effective in clinical trials and in real-world conditions. Out of more than 220 million doses administered so far and clinical trials with thousands of participants, there is no evidence showing that vaccinating those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections could be unsafe. 
On the contrary, increasingly growing evidence shows one dose of the vaccine benefits individuals who’ve recovered from the infection, boosting their immune response and providing them with full protection for a period of time. 
""Our study and several other studies show that there is a benefit, immunologically … in people who were previously infected,"" E. John Wherry, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview.
Yet a number of viral posts question the need of vaccinating those who’ve already recovered from COVID-19, and one of them, published by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, falsely claims it ""could potentially cause harm, or even death."" 
Researchers told FactCheck.org that is not what the evidence is showing. 
""There’s no indication that vaccinating people who had previously had COVID is resulting in an increased risk of adverse events,"" Wherry said. 
Wherry, who is one of the lead authors of a study looking at the immune responses to the mRNA vaccines in individuals with and without previous infections, said people who recover from the disease show different levels of antibodies created by the immune system to identify and neutralize the virus. The vaccines, he said, improved the immune response in individuals by raising the levels of neutralizing antibodies in those who’ve been infected. 
""Some people actually have fairly low antibody responses that are not sufficient to neutralize the virus, especially variant viruses. When you vaccinate them uniformly, you get high antibody titers [measurements] and high neutralization titers, so there’s an improvement in at least one of the key metrics of immunity following vaccination,"" he said.
According to guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who’ve already had COVID-19 should be vaccinated anyway because ""experts do not yet know how long"" they are protected from getting sick again. Those who’ve gotten the disease get some protection by building what’s called natural immunity. And although available evidence shows that reinfection is uncommon in the months following the first infection, the CDC says that may vary over time. 
""Available data suggest that previously infected individuals can be at risk of COVID-19 (i.e., reinfection) and could benefit from vaccination. Furthermore, data suggest that the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines in previously infected individuals is just as favorable as in previously uninfected individuals,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told us in an email. 
Up until now, the passive and active surveillance systems set up to monitor the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines have only found rare adverse events associated with the vaccines. 
A small number of people (2 to 5 people per million vaccinated) have reported a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. And the CDC and the FDA are studying a small number of cases of people who experienced a rare and severe type of blood clot with low platelets after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. As a result, the agencies recommended a pause in the use of this product. On April 23, a CDC panel of advisers recommended the pause be lifted. 
No Evidence of Risk for Previously Infected Individuals 
In a blog post on The Defender, a website owned by R.F.K. Jr.’s organization, Children’s Health Defense, a freelance reporter writes that there’s no science supporting the need of vaccinating people who have recovered from COVID-19. ""There’s a potential risk of harm, including death, in vaccinating those who’ve already had the disease or were recently infected,"" the post claimed. 
Researchers don’t agree, including one quoted by The Defender. 
Dr. Colleen Kelley, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Emory University School of Medicine and the principal investigator for Moderna’s and Novavax’s phase 3 vaccine trials at Emory, is quoted by The Defender as saying people with previous infection get ""harsher side effects"" after vaccination. Her remarks came from a HuffPost article in March.
In a phone interview, Kelley told us that tolerable side effects are expected, and not always present. In the Moderna trials, ""there did not appear to be an increased rate of side effects among people who were antibody positive when they were vaccinated,"" she said.  
""There is absolutely no evidence that there is any harm for people to be vaccinated, who have previously had COVID disease,"" Kelley said. 
The Defender’s claims are mostly based on statements by Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, a former assistant professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, who has been warning health officials, vaccine manufacturers and more recently university leaders of the potential danger of vaccinating people who have recently been infected with the novel coronavirus.

Noorchashm has been voicing his arguments widely, including on Fox News’ ""Tucker Carlson Today"" and The Defender podcast. But he admits they are based on ""a ‘prognostication’ in that I have put it forth in the absence of clear ‘evidence’ of it being a material risk."" 
Based on previous studies not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Noorchashm argues that antigens of SARS-CoV-2 remain in the tissues of someone who’s been infected for some time after they’ve recovered. The vaccine, he says, reactivates the immune response, targeting the tissues where these antigens remain, causing further inflammation and damage, including to the vascular endothelium, the thin tissue that lines the heart and blood vessels. 
""Most pertinently, when viral antigens are present in the vascular endothelium or other layers of the blood vessel, and especially in elderly and frail with cardiovascular disease, the antigen specific immune response incited by the vaccine is almost certain to do damage to the vascular endothelium,"" he said in a Jan. 26 letter sent to FDA officials and Pfizer executives. ""Such vaccine directed endothelial damage is certain to cause blood clot formation with the potential for major thromboembolic complications, at least in a subset of such patients."" 
In a phone interview with FactCheck.org, Noorchashm explained that all medical treatments, including vaccines, have some complications. And if those complications happen when a treatment is avoidable — in this case, he says, vaccinating those who’ve recently been infected — then that’s potentially harmful. 
His recommendation is to test people’s antibodies before vaccination and to delay vaccination for approximately eight months after infection. He and his wife, a physician who died in 2017, fought for years to ban a tool used to remove uterine fibroids, after the procedure spread cancer into his wife’s abdomen. 
Dr. Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa whose lab studies immunopathology in respiratory virus infections, told us he’s not aware of any scientific data that demonstrates that viral antigens persist long after the SARS-CoV-2 infection has gone away. And if there were, he says, there would likely be insufficient levels to drive such a robust immune response to cause the damage Noorchashm suggests. 
""Generally, once the virus is cleared, there can be some viral antigen that persists in various locations, so it is possible there could be some in the endothelium,"" Varga said. ""Again, I’m not aware of any studies that have shown that to be the case. But even if there were small amounts of viral antigen, generally that shouldn’t be enough viral antigen to induce the type of damage that would need to occur to have the kind of more severe outcome."" 
Dr. Donna Farber, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University focused on immunological memory, told us Noorchashm’s prognostication is not consistent with the data. 
""The data are that the virus is cleared from the lungs, the virus is cleared from the upper respiratory tract. And so if there’s no virus, there’s no antigen,"" Farber, who recently published a study on the immune response to COVID-19 in the lungs, said in a phone interview. 
Farber added that the protective immunity provided by the vaccine, neutralizing antibodies, do not cause the sort of harm Noorchashm is talking about. That could happen, she says as an example, if there was a virus hidden in cells and then a patient is given cytotoxic T cells, a type of immune cell that can kill infected cells or cancer cells. 
""But the chance of that happening in a vaccine — and for a vaccine that’s really targeting neutralizing antibodies and not, you know, the sort of a killer T cell response —  it’s just inconsistent with the science,"" she said. 
Farber also said for most pathogens, our immune system requires repeated exposure to get protection over time. That’s why people get a vaccine for influenza every year, she said, regardless if they’ve been exposed to the virus or not. 
""Seeing an antigen again and again, isn’t bad for you. It’s what we do all the time. And it’s what our immune system has evolved to do. And that’s how it generates its best memory,"" she said.
Benefits of Vaccine on Previously Infected Individuals
According to The Defender’s post, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued a report ""that falsely claimed a Pfizer study proved the vaccine was highly effective"" for people with previous infections. 
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, ""found that vaccine studies showed no benefit to people who had coronavirus and that getting vaccinated didn’t change their odds of getting reinfected"" and asked the CDC to fix the mistake in the report, The Defender said.
The CDC added an erratum to the report on Jan. 29, but it merely mentions that consistent high efficacy was found ""in a secondary analysis including participants both with or without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.""
The report shows that in the Pfizer/BioNTech clinical trials the vaccine was 94% effective and ""when you look at both groups together, the data suggest the vaccine works well in both groups,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlung told us. It also showed, Nordlung added, that those who had COVID-19 can still be at risk of reinfection and could benefit from the vaccine, not be harmed by it. 
As we’ve explained, scientific studies do show benefits for those who’ve recovered from the infections. 
A recent study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal found that a prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not completely protect young people against reinfection. The study observed over 3,000 healthy U.S. Marine Corps recruits, 18 to 20 years old, from May to November 2020. The study found that around 10% of the participants who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 became reinfected. In comparison, 48% of those without previous infection became infected.
A different observational study was done in Denmark using data from approximately 10 million polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests during two surges last year, from March to May 2020 and from September to December. According to their analysis a previous infection provided about 80-83% protection against a second infection in people younger than 65 years old and 47% for those aged 65 years and older. 
According to a CDC study, both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines reduced the risk of infection, in real-world conditions, by 90% two weeks after the second dose. 
In addition, it has been reported that the vaccine may actually be helping people with previous infections and long-lasting symptoms, what’s been called ""long COVID."" 
When asked about other studies supporting Rep. Massie’s statements, his office sent us an FDA presentation and an FDA memo reviewing the efficacy and safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Both show high general efficacy and the second specifically mentions that since the clinical trial didn’t include many people with prior infection ""available data are insufficient to make conclusions about benefit in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection."" 
John Kennedy, Massie’s communications director, told us the congressman didn’t say whether the vaccine can be dangerous for those with previous infections. In fact, Kennedy said, ""Congressman Massie believes that the Pfizer and Moderna trials he commented on didn’t really demonstrate higher rates of adverse reaction for those with prior infection.""  
Vaccination After Infection: How Long to Wait?
Although the CDC once recommended that those recovering from COVID-19 wait 90 days before receiving a vaccine, that advice now only applies to those who were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. 
""While there is no recommended minimum interval between infection and vaccination, current evidence suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is low in the months after initial infection but may increase with time due to waning immunity,"" CDC’s interim clinical considerations for use of the vaccines say. ""Thus, while vaccine supply remains limited, people with recent documented acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may choose to temporarily delay vaccination, if desired, recognizing that the risk of reinfection and, therefore, the need for vaccination, might increase with time following initial infection.""
Experts interviewed for this story agreed that those recovering from COVID-19 or an infection should wait somewhere between three weeks and 90 days to get vaccinated. But that’s because that would ensure a better immune response, not because it could be dangerous.
""Usually you want to wait a month for the immune response to die down a little bit and for you to get back to baseline, because if you’re back to baseline, you’ll respond better to vaccines,"" Farber said. 
Varga added it is best to give the immune system some time to build memory cells, which would improve its response the next time the body sees the antigen. 
""You would get a lower antibody response and T cell response if you got vaccinated, you know, just a very short time frame after recovering, versus if it was, you know, three or four weeks ago,"" he said.
Vaccination After Infection: One or Two Doses?
The FDA issued its emergency use authorization to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines based on the safety and efficacy evidence provided by clinical trials using two doses of the vaccine. 
""Individuals who have received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose on schedule to complete the vaccination series,"" said an FDA spokesperson.
But a number of recent studies, including some which have not yet been peer-reviewed, show that only one dose could be enough for those previously infected to be fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 and some of its variants. 
One of them, published by a team from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Science Immunology, found that in individuals who recovered from the infection, the first vaccine dose ""significantly boosted"" antibody and memory B cell responses, but a second dose did not increase ""circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers or antigen-specific memory B cells."" 
The study was relatively small —  44 healthy individuals, including 11 who had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection —  but it was the first study to look at memory B cells, which provide long-term immunity, in addition to antibodies, which provide immediate response. 
Another study published as a preprint on medRxiv by a research team led by Florian Krammer and Viviana Simon from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, recruited 109 participants, including 41 with previous infections. The study showed that the immune response to the first dose of the vaccine for those previously infected was equal, and sometimes stronger, than the response to the second for those who had never had SARS-CoV-2.
None of these eight studies described harmful effects of vaccination, either with one or two doses, on participants who had suffered a previous infection. The Mount Sinai study found that those already primed with the infection showed a stronger immune response (sore arm, fever, chills, fatigue) to the first dose of the vaccine. But Wherry, one of the lead authors of the Penn study, said their study observed no increase in circulating antibodies after the second dose. 
""We did not see any harm from the second dose, we just didn’t see any benefit,"" Wherry said. 
Is one vaccine dose enough then? 
Maybe, according to the National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, if other studies support these results and FDA and CDC expert advisors agree. In a blog, Collins wrote that such a policy is under consideration in France and, if implemented, it could extend global vaccine supply and speed up the vaccination process.  
""While much more research is needed—and I am definitely not suggesting a change in the current recommendations right now—the results raise the possibility that one dose might be enough for someone who’s been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and already generated antibodies against the virus,"" he wrote. 
An FDA spokesperson said studies ""are currently being conducted to evaluate whether one dose is sufficient"" for those with previous infections. 
Wherry said larger studies are needed, specifically some looking at protection. So far, all of the studies are looking at immunological events, but none of them have studied how well one dose could protect someone in the real world. 
""I’m reluctant to change policy based on immunological data alone. I’d want to see actual efficacy of one dose versus two doses. And that’s gonna be very hard to do in the real world,"" Wherry said. 
Clarification, April 27: Although nothing in the article indicates that Dr. Noorchashm is a member of an anti-vaccination group, Dr. Noorchashm requested that we add that he is not anti-vaccine. He said he has been vaccinated against COVID-19.  
Correction, June 30: We corrected the name of the journal Science Immunology. We originally called it Science Immunologist.

      Trump Campaign’s Misleading Ad Attacking Biden on China

		The Trump campaign has launched a misleading attack ad that misrepresents Joe Biden’s statements on the Trump administration’s travel restrictions, and leaves the false impression that former U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, a Chinese-American, is a Chinese official.
The ad says that Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was opposed to President Donald Trump’s travel restrictions on China — the Biden campaign says he was for them — and generally strives to portray Biden as far too soft on the Chinese regime.
Ironically, some of Biden’s positive statements about the Chinese echo statements by Trump.
Near the end, the online ad, which debuted on YouTube on April 9 and had been viewed more than 170,000 times by the following day, seems to raise questions about Biden’s cognitive powers.
After depicting Biden as opposed to Trump’s China policies, quoting him as saying he rejected ""hysterical xenophobia"" and ""fearmongering,"" the ad pivots with the words, ""until he forgot he did."" It then has a clip of Biden saying of Trump, ""I complimented him on dealing with China, "" followed by an image of Biden with a goofy grin. Then it has a clip of Biden saying, ""I’m not going nuts.""
The image of Biden with Locke comes about 40 seconds into the one-minute ad and is in the midst of a montage of photos of Biden with Chinese leaders. Democrats were quick to condemn the image, which provided no context, leaving the impression that Locke, who was born in Washington state and also served as governor of Washington and as President Barack Obama’s secretary of commerce, was a Chinese official.
Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who is Taiwanese-American, described the ad in a tweet as ""infuriating,"" adding, ""Gary Locke is as American as the day is long."" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates called for the ad to be ""pulled immediately.""
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh defended the ad, tweeting, in response to the image of Biden and Locke from the ad, ""The shot with the flags specifically places Biden in Beijing in 2013. It’s for a reason. That’s the Hunter Biden trip. Memory Lane for ol’ Joe.""
The new ad includes a photo of Joe and his son Hunter Biden with audio from a news report saying ""Biden’s son inked a billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the Bank of China."" That’s largely accurate.
As we have reported, Hunter Biden was involved with the cross-border private equity fund involving some state-owned financial companies in China that had hoped to raise $1.5 billion in 2014 for investments. It’s unclear when that goal was reached, but the company website said as of 2019 it managed assets worth the equivalent of over $2.1 billion in U.S. dollars.
In suggesting Biden opposed Trump’s travel restrictions on China,  the ad has a clip of Biden saying, ""Banning all travel will not stop it."" But that misrepresents what Biden said — and he wasn’t even talking about China.
In his March 12 speech on the novel coronavirus pandemic, Biden said, ""And it will not stop, banning all travel from Europe or any other part of the world may slow it, but as we’ve seen it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics rather than a risk will be counterproductive.""
So Biden was talking about the travel restrictions imposed on Europe, not China, and he was not registering blanket opposition to all travel restrictions, just those that are ""based on favoritism and politics rather than a risk.""
The ad also refers twice to Biden attacking Trump for ""hysterical xenophobia"" to indicate his opposition to the China restrictions. That’s a matter of dispute.
As we have reported, on Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced, Biden, campaigning in Iowa, said that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans ""need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it."" He added, ""This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.""
Biden didn’t mention Trump’s travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had recently traveled to China in his speech, so it’s unclear what he meant when he criticized Trump’s ""hysterical xenophobia."" The Biden campaign told us the candidate wasn’t referring to the travel rules, but rather to what it called Trump’s ""long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China.""
On April 3, the Biden campaign said its candidate backed the travel restrictions.
""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.""
The ad features a number of statements by Biden wrapping China in a warm embrace: ""China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They’re good folks, folks."" Biden is also shown saying, ""It is in our self-interest that China continue to prosper."" And ""What a beautiful history we wrote together.""
But Trump, who did embark on a trade war with China, also has said many conciliatory things about the Chinese, and how the U.S. and China can help each other succeed.
For example, on Jan. 22 he tweeted, ""One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA & China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country.""
In a meeting with China’s vice premier on Oct. 11, 2019, Trump said of the first phase of the trade deal reached with China, ""Now we have a deal that I think ultimately is going to be just fantastic for China and fantastic for the United States.""
And on April 7, the president said at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House,  ""I like China.  I like — the Chinese people are phenomenal people.""
Correction, May 4: We originally misspelled Kate Bedingfield’s last name. We regret the error.

      FactChecking Ad About Donating ‘Our Masks and Supplies’ to China

		A Democratic group’s ad attacking President Donald Trump leaves the misleading impression that medical equipment donated by U.S.-based organizations and businesses to China early in the global coronavirus outbreak came from the Trump administration.
""He shipped China 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies,"" says the ad from American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC, referring to Trump. ""Our masks and supplies. Supplies we need now.""
It’s true the State Department was involved in delivering to China tons of personal protective equipment donated by American companies and organizations in early February. The State Department even lauded the donations as ""a testament to the generosity of the American people,"" and said they were an example of ""strong U.S. leadership in response to the outbreak.""


But the medical supplies were not ""American"" or ""ours"" in the sense that they belonged to the federal government, which the ad’s language may lead viewers to believe. The equipment was donated by those companies and organizations specifically for use by health care workers in China.
The 30-second commercial, titled ""Trust,"" started running this week in select media markets in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The super PAC said it’s ""the first wave of a $15 million campaign"" to counter TV spots airing from a pro-Trump group, America First Action. 
So far, the ad has run in those three states — which Trump won by only about 80,000 votes combined — at a cost of nearly $190,000, according to Advertising Analytics.

The ad starts by highlighting complimentary remarks Trump made about China, which reporting shows was slow to report the outbreak of the new coronavirus that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan near the end of 2019. (We previously wrote about some of Trump’s comments praising Chinese President Xi Jinping’s response to what has now become a global pandemic.)
The ad’s narrator then goes on to say: ""Trump gave China more than praise. He shipped China 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies — our masks and supplies. Supplies we need now. Trump trusted China, sent China our supplies, and just look at the mess we’re in now.""
Actually, the supplies were donated by U.S.-based organizations and businesses in a humanitarian gesture at a time when nearly all of the reported cases of and deaths from the novel coronavirus were in China. 
On Feb. 7, the director-general of the World Health Organization declared that there was a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE, and that ""[f]rontline health workers in China require the bulk of PPE supplies.""
The same day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the State Department had ""facilitated the transportation"" of almost 18 tons of ""donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials."" The donations were loaded onto State Department-chartered planes that were already headed to China that week to bring back hundreds of U.S. citizens stranded in the country.
About a week later, the department provided a little more information about the delivery it helped coordinate with Project HOPE, an international health training and humanitarian organization that has worked in Wuhan since the 1990s.
Department of State, Feb. 15: Last week, thanks to a joint effort of federal and local authorities and private organizations and companies, 17.8 tons of personal protection equipment and medical supplies were delivered, and more than 800 people were evacuated from Wuhan, China, amidst the Novel Coronavirus outbreak.
A number of organizations, companies, and private entities donated life-saving aid and supplies. Project HOPE received and distributed 101 pallets of personal protection equipment and medical supplies provided by Samaritan’s Purse, Boeing, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Intermountain Healthcare.
A spokeswoman for Project HOPE confirmed to FactCheck.org that the group received the donations.
""The only supplies received by Project HOPE in China that were transported on State Department-chartered flights were the nearly 17.8 tons donated by American relief organizations and businesses to help China’s doctors and nurses contain the COVID-19 outbreak,"" Rebecca Gustafson, senior director of global media relations at Project HOPE, said in an email.
Boeing had already announced on Jan. 29 that it was preparing to donate ""250,000 medical-grade respiratory masks to address medical supply shortages in China."" A spokesperson for the aviation giant told us in an email that the company’s donation was included as part of the shipment for Project HOPE in China.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also announced on Jan. 29 that it was partnering with the humanitarian group and donating to China 220,000 respirator masks, 870 pairs of protective goggles and over 6,500 pairs of protective coveralls. The article on its website said the church’s president decided to make the donation after inquiring and learning from ""longtime friends in China"" of a need for ""protective equipment at the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center, where supplies have been depleted because of the outbreak in Wuhan.""
In an update to that article days later, the church said the supplies were delivered to China on Feb. 4 — the same day the planes chartered by the State Department arrived in China.
And a spokeswoman for Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian disaster relief organization, told us it ""donated 78 pallets of medical supplies and personal protective equipment to Hubei, China"" for coronavirus assistance. ""The State Department facilitated the delivery of these items,"" she said in a statement.


On the day all of the contributions were delivered, the WHO reported that there were more than 20,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and more than 400 deaths there due to the disease. At the same time, there were 11 confirmed cases in the U.S, and the first reported death from the illness in the U.S. didn’t come until Feb. 29, more than three weeks later.
The super PAC told us its ad was simply stating the facts about the shipment.
""As the Washington Post’s own reporting and multiple fact-checking organizations have already verified, the president’s own state department, as they said themselves, shipped 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies to China in February under the president’s own direction,"" said Jeb Fain, spokesman for American Bridge. ""Those are the facts and they’re not up for debate. This president doesn’t get to avoid accountability now that he finds it politically inconvenient.""
It’s not for us to say whether the federal government should have been involved in delivering the much-needed materials to China when the U.S. would later experience a coronavirus-related PPE shortage of its own.
But readers should know that when the American Bridge ad says Trump sent ""our masks and supplies"" to China, it’s a reference to equipment American companies and businesses donated specifically to help health officials in China. The PPE did not come from the government’s own reserves nor was it assigned for use in the U.S.

		Quick Take
A viral Facebook post, spreading a political conspiracy theory about COVID-19, is wrongly attributed to former Rep. Trey Gowdy. Gowdy confirmed to us that he did not write the post in question.


Full Story 
Former Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina has publicly weighed in on some issues concerning the novel coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. politics surrounding it.
But the former Republican congressman did not write a more than 400-word conspiracy theory circulating on Facebook that implies, without any proof, that the outbreak was planned to help Democrats in the 2020 election.
""From Trey Gowdy,"" the post begins. ""I’m not saying Covid-19 isn’t real… But Pay attention folks, there’s much more going on here than what meets the eye."" 
It goes on to claim, among other things, that ""there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment"" and that ""[i]t all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election.""
It’s unclear why or when Gowdy, a high-profile congressman who served from 2011 until Jan. 3, 2019, became tied to the viral text post. We found the same text repeatedly posted to Facebook as early as March 12 with no such attribution.
As the posts using his name (and image, in some cases) swirled in late April, Gowdy dismissed the attribution on his verified Facebook account.
""Just want to alert folks there is a fraudulent post attributed to me circulating on social media,"" he wrote in an April 22 post. ""Not the first time, likely not the last. We have enough going on in our country right now without propagating misinformation. Stay safe and strong.""
In an email to FactCheck.org, Gowdy confirmed that his statement was referring to the viral COVID-19 post.
Some versions of the post tying the text to Gowdy were updated in light of his Facebook statement.
One such post appeared on the Facebook page of Beatrice Cardenas, a Republican congressional candidate in California, and used the Gowdy attribution and an image of the former congressman. It remains up and has been shared 48,000 times, but an update was added at the bottom reading: ""4/22 EDIT: several people have sent me a message posted by Trey Gowdy making a disclaimer about posts attributed to him he did not write. We are unsure who was the original author.""
Still, multiple versions of the post leave the false attribution in place — and new ones are still being published.
And other iterations have used different attributions altogether. Another post of the same text was credited to former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, even though there’s no evidence it was his work, either. One simply sourced it to an unnamed ""Trump Supporter.""
This is just the latest example of a viral post leveraging a name to advance an argument.

Participants in the 2020 Olympic Games will be subject to many COVID-19 rules. But social media posts and a news report falsely claim athletes will be sleeping on specially made, flimsy ""anti-sex beds"" to prevent intimacy and COVID-19 infection. The beds were designed before the pandemic and can bear more than 400 pounds, the mattress company said.

              The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is transmitted from person to person, ""most likely"" when in close contact, within about 6 feet of one another.
Scientists suspect the transmission is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through respiratory droplets when infected people cough, sneeze, talk or breathe. 
Although ""less likely,"" SARS-CoV-2 also can be spread through airborne transmission, meaning through small respiratory particles that linger in the air and can reach those who are further than 6 feet away, the CDC says. The evidence shows such airborne transmissions have occurred in enclosed spaces, without adequate ventilation and have involved exercising, shouting or singing by the infected person, the CDC says. Such transmission occurs after ""[p]rolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes,"" according to the CDC.
The virus spreads ""more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles,"" which is one of the most contagious viruses and one that is transmitted through airborne particles, the CDC says. 
The incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be around four to five days, but can be as long as 14 days, according to the CDC. There is some evidence that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others, although the CDC says there is also ""a growing body of evidence [that] suggests fully vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection and potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""
It also could be possible for people to contract the disease by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their mouth, nose or even eyes, ""but the risk is generally considered to be low,"" according to the CDC.

Full Story

Amid concerns for athletes and the international community during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games were postponed from the initial start date in July of last year. The opening ceremony began in Tokyo on July 23, and the games are set to run through Aug. 8. The Summer Paralympics will be held Aug. 24 to Sept. 5.
There still will be many restrictions and rules at the games in Japan as the pandemic continues. Spectators have been banned from all venues. And participating athletes will be required to follow strict guidelines, including those related to quarantining, testing, masking and social distancing.
As athletes began arriving in the Olympic Village, however, a news report and social media posts distorted the limitations set for the participants.
One Facebook post falsely claimed, ""Not other games in Tokyo. Athletes will be using ‘anti-sex’ beds at the Olympics, reportedly made from cardboard and are only designed to be able to withstand the weight of one person. The beds are recyclable and expected to break with any sudden movements.""
An Instagram post picked up the bogus claim: ""Tokyo 2020: ‘Anti-Sex’ beds for athletes to prevent intimacy in Olympics Village.""
The claim was amplified in a July 18 New York Post story headlined ""Athletes to sleep on ‘anti-sex’ cardboard beds at Olympic Games amid COVID."" As evidence, the story quotes a July 16 tweet from Team USA distance runner Paul Chelimo that reads in part, ""Beds to be installed in Tokyo Olympic Village will be made of cardboard, this is aimed at avoiding intimacy among athletes."" 
The New York Post story posits that this is intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. ""The world’s best sports competitors are set to spend their nights on cardboard beds — allegedly designed to collapse under the weight of fornicators to discourage sex amid COVID-19,"" the article said. 
While it’s true that the Olympians’ beds in Tokyo are made of cardboard, and are intended to be recycled, claims that their design is intended to deter sex between athletes or that they ""break with any sudden movements"" are not accurate. 
The beds were designed before the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. The Japanese mattress company Airweave revealed the design at a press conference in September 2019, a spokesperson told us in an email.
 And the beds do not break under the weight of more than one person. An official statement released on Twitter by the company on July 20 says that the beds can withstand up to 440 pounds. The statement also describes how the company conducted pressure tests to ensure the beds’ durability. One such test can be viewed here. 
USA Today reported on Sept. 24, 2019, that Takashi Kitajima, a Tokyo 2020 organizer in charge of the Olympic Village, said that the aim of the cardboard beds was to provide comfort for the athletes while also being environmentally sustainable. 
Rhys McClenaghan, an Irish gymnast, tweeted an in-person demonstration of the durability of the beds on July 17. He filmed himself jumping repeatedly on one of the beds while saying the claim that the beds break easily is ""fake, fake news.""

		In this video, we look at President Donald Trump’s misleading claim that there’s ""very strong evidence"" to support his hope that a malaria drug can treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Trump has touted two malaria drugs — chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine — that also are approved for use to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. But there is only limited evidence at this time to suggest the drugs are safe and effective against the new coronavirus.

A few lab studies show the drugs have antiviral effects against the new coronavirus in cells grown in culture. But that’s only in cells.
In the past, for example, chloroquine has been found to inhibit a variety of viruses in cells, including influenza and chikungunya. But when tested in animals or people, those results didn’t hold.
China has reportedly used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in some COVID-19 clinical trials, but most of those studies haven’t been published yet. One that has been published found ""no significant reduction in time to clinical improvement or viral clearance in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the conventional therapy control group,"" according to a World Health Organization report.
The authors of the trial concluded that the drug needed to be tested in a larger group of patients. 
Despite the president’s enthusiasm for the potential of hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has cautioned that the evidence supporting the drug is anecdotal — and that it would take a large, well-done clinical trial to prove its effectiveness.
For more information, read our story ""Trump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim."" Also, see the ""Guide to Our Coronavirus Coverage"" for more stories on the pandemic.

		Quick Take
A viral image circulating online is falsely advising social media users that gargling water with salt or vinegar ""eliminates"" the coronavirus. There is currently ""no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,"" according to the World Health Organization.


Full Story 
It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus.
One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar ""eliminates"" the virus.
The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, ""before it reaches the lungs,"" the coronavirus ""remains in the throat for four days"" and that drinking a lot of water ""and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.""

The World Health Organization, however, notes that ""to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,"" which causes the COVID-19 disease.
While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, ""it doesn’t kill the virus,"" Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us.
""You’re not rinsing it away so it doesn’t go to your lungs,"" Dela Cruz, also director of the university’s Center for Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment, said in a phone interview. 

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reports that symptoms — often fever, cough or shortness of breath — appear within 14 days of exposure.
As for actual advice, Dela Cruz said ""the key is to limit getting infected."" He emphasized health officials’ guidance that people should frequently wash their hands with soap and water; avoid touching their faces; and avoid large crowds and close contact with people who are sick.

		SciCheck Digest
A Food and Drug Administration presentation on monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines listed possible adverse events the agency might track. But an Instagram post misrepresents the document, falsely claiming it shows the vaccines are known to cause harmful side effects — including death.


    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How do we know vaccines are safe?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

              Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever.
Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain and chills. These reactions are more likely after the second dose of those vaccines, given several weeks after the first, and are more common and severe in younger people. The Johnson & Johnson side effects, too, were more common in 18- to 59-year-old participants, and also included nausea.
As the CDC explains, these common side effects are normal signs that your body is beginning to mount an immune response and the symptoms should go away within several days. Some people have no side effects, and that is normal, too.
Rarely, the COVID-19 vaccines may cause more serious problems. This includes a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which has occurred in 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated, according to the CDC, and, for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a blood clotting disorder coupled with low levels of platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). As of July 12, that issue, which has almost entirely affected women below the age of 50, has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine.
The FDA also has warned of an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome associated with the J&J vaccine. The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases including one reported death, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine.
Additionally, there is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men.

Full Story
A popular Instagram post cites a government document to falsely claim that federal officials know that the COVID-19 vaccines cause death and other dangerous side effects — ""yet will not publicly warn"" citizens.

The image — shared on Instagram accounts such as ""awaken_the_mind,"" ""the_truth_hunters"" and ""the_truth_hunters_2"" — claims: ""FDA DOCUMENTS: mRNA VACCINE CAUSES DEATH + 21 SIDE EFFECTS."" It goes on to allege that an ""internal FDA document revealed a shocking revilation"" about the purported side effects — such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, stroke, autoimmune disease and ""pregnancy & birth outcomes.""
But the post is wrong. The Food and Drug Administration presentation cited, which is actually publicly available, doesn’t say that. And as we’ve previously reported, there is no evidence that vaccines have caused any deaths. As of March 15, the CDC reported that it has found ""no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.""
The ""mRNA"" refers to one of the ways that COVID-19 vaccines are designed. The first two vaccines approved in the U.S. — one from Pfizer/BioNTech and the other from Moderna — both use modified messenger RNA, or mRNA, to provide instructions for cells to make spike proteins. That triggers an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. (For more, see our SciCheck stories, ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine."")
The third vaccine approved in the U.S., a one-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, is designed differently and does not use mRNA.

The link cited at the bottom of the Instagram post goes to a presentation by Steve Anderson, who directs the Office of Biostatistics & Epidemiology at the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. That presentation was given at an Oct. 30 meeting by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a committee that provides vaccine-related guidance for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Anderson’s report outlined a variety of ways that CBER would monitor vaccine safety upon rollout. The government uses several monitoring systems to that end.
One slide in Anderson’s presentation showed a ""[w]orking list of possible adverse event outcomes"" that the FDA planned to monitor — the list now cited in the Instagram post. It wasn’t addressing mRNA vaccines in particular, as the Instagram post claims.
And the presentation didn’t say the vaccines actually are known to cause those health issues, let alone kill people. The same misrepresentation was made by a dubious website in December and debunked by our fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact and the Associated Press.
An FDA spokesperson told us that ""the document cited is a slide deck on how FDA would plan to conduct safety surveillance on a potential COVID-19 vaccine once authorized"" and noted the same deck was also presented at an earlier FDA advisory committee meeting in October.
""No specific COVID-19 vaccine was discussed at that meeting, but rather that meeting was held to discuss — in general — the criteria FDA may take into account when making a decision about emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine,"" the spokesperson said. ""The list of adverse events on slide 16 is a list of possible outcomes that the FDA could potentially monitor for when conducting safety surveillance once a vaccine was authorized.""
Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University, told us in a phone interview that it’s ""unfortunate"" that the list — part of a precautionary safety process — is being misconstrued to wrongly suggest that the vaccines are dangerous.

There’s a difference between a report of an adverse event following immunization and an adverse event caused by the vaccine, he said. Officials develop a list of adverse events following immunization to monitor in order to proactively ensure the vaccine rollout is safe. The list is compiled by experts using a variety of factors; for example, officials may want to track outcomes associated with the disease from which the vaccines are designed to protect.
By tracking specific adverse events that are reported through its various surveillance systems, the government can conduct rapid analyses to determine whether any observed events following vaccination are more common than expected, Salmon said. In other words, experts can assess whether any health outcomes that are observed are consistent with what would be expected in a given population.


""The message here should be: government’s being careful, being cautious, being prudent,"" he said.

According to the CDC, the ongoing monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccines is ""the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history."" And in the months since the distortion first spread, tens of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been safely administered in the country.
With more than 109 million doses administered in the U.S. as of March 15, the CDC says, it received 1,913 reports through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System of deaths that took place after someone received a vaccine. As we’ve explained before, reports of deaths through VAERS do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event, since anyone can submit reports — regardless of whether an immunization is thought to have contributed to the event.
CDC and FDA physicians review the facts surrounding each death reported through VAERS. And the CDC reported on March 15: ""A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.""
Many people who get the vaccines experience mild side effects — such as pain at the injection site, a headache, chills or fever — the CDC notes. A ""small number of people have had a severe allergic reaction (called ‘anaphylaxis’) after vaccination, but this is extremely rare. If this occurs, vaccination providers have medicines available to effectively and immediately treat the reaction.""
Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says ""women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen."" As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see ""Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.""

		In the first TV ads of the runoff campaign that could help decide the balance of the Senate, Republican Sen. David Perdue warned his opponent would ""radically change America,"" while Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff accused his opponent of downplaying the coronavirus.
The ad from Perdue makes the misleading claims that Ossoff would ""defund police"" and provide ""voting rights for illegal immigrants."" Ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police. And while he supports providing a pathway to citizenship to some 11 million immigrants currently in the country illegally, he does not support voting rights for noncitizens.
Ossoff’s ad offers similar side-by-side comments from Perdue and President Donald Trump that the ad contends show Perdue ""ignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.""
We’ll leave it to readers to decide for themselves if Perdue’s comments did that, but some of the comments highlighted in the ad came early in the year at a time when medical experts were making similar comments. And Perdue made other comments warning about the seriousness of the virus and reinforcing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to reduce the spread of the virus.
Perdue’s Ad
The first TV ad of the runoff from the Perdue campaign begins with a clip of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer celebrating after Joe Biden was projected the winner of the presidential race, telling a crowd in New York, ""Now we take Georgia, then we change America.""

If Democrats were to flip the two Senate seats in Georgia’s January runoff elections — Perdue vs. Ossoff and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler vs. Democrat Raphael Warnock — Democrats would control both houses of Congress and the presidency.
""You heard him,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Chuck Schumer is trying to use Georgia to take the Senate majority and radically change America. The Schumer, Pelosi, Ossoff change? Defund police. Voting rights for illegal immigrants. Washington, D.C. as the 51st state.""
That’s a distortion of Ossoff’s positions. Ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police.
For example, in a Sirius XM radio interview on Sept. 11, Ossoff said, ""I oppose defunding the police and I think frankly, it’s a counterproductive and foolish way of characterizing what I think for some folks is a desire to reform police.""
In an interview on WSB radio on June 11, Ossoff reiterated, ""No, the answer is not to defund police. The answer is to reform police. And the answer is to demilitarize police. Far too many local police departments are heavily equipped with armored vehicles and military equipment, and when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.""
The Perdue campaign points to comments Ossoff made in a radio interview in June: ""You have to have national standards for the use of force, and yeah, you’ve got to be able to hold individual officers and entire departments accountable, and there also has to be funding for those departments on the line."" (Starting at the 19:39 mark.)
The Ossoff campaign says that Ossoff was talking about supplemental police funding, and that Ossoff’s position is similar to that of Biden, who in June told CBS News, ""No, I don’t support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.""
As we have written, there is no agreed upon definition for the term ""defund the police."" Some police critics, who believe there is systemic racism in law enforcement, really do want to abolish police forces and replace them with other forms of community safety entities. Others advocate shifting some money and functions away from police departments to social service agencies.
Ossoff told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in August that he agrees with Biden’s position of tying federal funds for law enforcement agencies to meeting certain standards, including whether they can ""demonstrate they can protect the community.""
The ad also distorts Ossoff’s position when it says he supports ""voting rights for illegal immigrants."" Ossoff’s campaign told us he does not, and the Perdue campaign didn’t provide any evidence that he does.
The Perdue campaign points to Biden’s support for ""providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants"" currently in the U.S., including the so-called Dreamers who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. A bipartisan immigration bill that sought to do the same thing passed the Senate in 2013 with the support of 14 Republicans, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, who co-sponsored the bill. Ossoff’s policy similarly calls for creating ""a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who are already here and otherwise follow the law.""
But that’s different from allowing ""voting rights for illegal immigrants."" As we have written, it would likely take more than a dozen years under such legislation for immigrants to gain full citizenship, and voting rights. But they would then be citizens, not ""illegal immigrants."" Ossoff’s campaign says he opposes voting rights for noncitizens.
The ad is correct that Ossoff supports statehood for Washington, D.C., but it’s not clear that statehood for D.C. could be accomplished even with a simple majority in the Senate. Under Senate rules, legislation can be blocked if it fails to receive the 60 votes necessary to end debate and move to a vote.
""Any effort to get DC statehood would be filibustered,"" Norm Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us via email. ""So the answer is that it would first require a change in the rules of the Senate to reform or end the filibuster, which is not going to happen with only 50 Democrats — at least not for some time. It could happen, if [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell’s Republicans used the filibuster to block everything — including COVID relief, infrastructure, and every other Biden initiative. But not for quite a while, and no sure thing at all.""
Ossoff’s Ad
The latest ad from the Ossoff campaign mirrors one it has been running since the summer, accusing Perdue of downplaying the coronavirus crisis. The runoff ad, called ""Echo,"" is updated to pair similar quotes from Perdue and Trump to make the case that Perdue ""ignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.""

We’ll just focus on the quotes attributed to Perdue. The quotes are accurate; however, they are misleadingly juxtaposed with a chart showing the rising COVID-19 death count. Some of Perdue’s comments were made early in the pandemic, long before the corresponding number of deaths reached the levels shown in the ad.
The first two quotes come from an interview Perdue did with The Valley’s Morning News podcast — a Georgia program  — on March 11. The bolded parts of the interview are included in the ad.
Perdue, March 11: It’s a balance between being precautionary and overreacting. And I think we have to realize that the risk of this virus in the United States right now still remains low. And the mortality rate is still being determined. The normal mortality rate of the normal flu is well under 1%. This so far is over 1%, but you know, so far, very, very few people have been exposed to it in the United States. […] So I think we’re doing what we should do right now. I don’t want to see America panic and overreact. But I do think it’s good for us to be precautionary and just take care of ourselves relative to whether we think we’re getting sick or have been exposed or anything like that.
Perdue went on to say that ""the authorities are not taking this lightly. We’re presuming the worst and preparing for the worst. But at the same time, we’re hopeful this thing will burn itself out before we see a dramatic increase in the numbers here.""
The Perdue campaign also noted that in this interview, Perdue reiterated CDC guidance: ""If you’re elderly or have a respiratory illness, be discretionary and stay away from large crowds. Use hand sanitizers, wash your hands frequently, try to stay away from people who are sick. And if you are sick, stay home. And if it feels like it’s getting serious, call a doctor, don’t go run to the emergency room right away but call a physician and get advice.""
To put these comments in the context of the moment, the day before the interview, there were about 1,500 COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with about 37 deaths, according to the COVID Tracking Project. At that time, the New York Times reported 17 cases in Georgia, and no deaths.
In comments on Feb. 29, less than two weeks before Perdue’s interview, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview on NBC’s ""Today"" show that the risk from COVID-19 ""is still low,"" and he said there was no need for people to change their daily routines ""at this moment."" But he warned that could change if ""you start to see community spread."" Fauci said the virus could develop into a ""major outbreak"" or ""it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled.""
On March 9, just two days before Perdue’s comments, Fauci was still talking about the coronavirus as ""an evolving thing"" and that holding campaign rallies ""in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment.""
Things changed quickly though in the days after Perdue made those comments on March 11. The day of that interview, the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak a pandemic, and two days later, Trump announced a national emergency.


The ad then highlights a comment Perdue made at a Chamber of Commerce meeting on May 14: ""We’ve had ordinary flu seasons with more deaths."" Perdue rightly noted that there were about 80,000 deaths from COVID-19 at that time, and there were an estimated 61,000 influenza deaths in the 2017-2018 flu season (though the average over the last decade has been fewer than 40,000 per year). But even at the time it was a flawed comparison and, of course, COVID-19-related deaths continued to mount through the summer and fall (and now stand at more than 247,000). We have repeatedly fact-checked the president for making faulty comparisons between the flu and COVID-19, which has proven to be much more deadly (as medical experts repeatedly warned).
The ad then uses a quote from Perdue at a different Chamber of Commerce meeting on April 28: ""The numbers projected were supposed to be much worse."" Perdue credited Trump’s actions for keeping those numbers down.
As we have written numerous times in the past when Trump claimed to have averted some 2 million deaths, a forecast of 2.2 million deaths in the U.S. is based on a model from Imperial College London in March that predicted U.S. deaths if no mitigation measures were taken and no individual behavior changes occurred. The figure, therefore, was not intended to be an estimate of likely deaths.
And as we have written, research does support the idea that lockdowns — which were instituted by states, not Trump — saved lives earlier this year, although it’s hard to say how many. 
Finally, the ad uses a clip from Perdue being interviewed on CNBC on June 16 in which he was asked about the reopening plan in Georgia. ""It’s going very well,"" Perdue said.
Fauci and other medical experts were critical in May of Georgia and some other Republican-led states for opening too early. At the time, Perdue told Politico that he had recently eaten in restaurants twice in Georgia and, ""We’ve got to get this economy open again. We’re on the back side of the cycle."" However, new cases spiked in Georgia in July and August.
Readers can make what they will of Perdue’s comments and decide for themselves if he downplayed the virus.
The Perdue campaign points to other comments and statements Perdue made around the same time that suggest he took the pandemic seriously and took measures to help protect the public.
For example, on March 2 after the first two cases of the coronavirus were reported in Georgia, Perdue and Loeffler issued a press release stating, in part, ""We’re closely monitoring the cases of coronavirus in Georgia and urge everyone to take extra precautions. Governor Kemp and the Trump Administration are working with us to ensure we keep Georgians healthy and safe. It is of utmost importance that Georgia has the resources necessary to respond accordingly.""
And on March 23, Perdue released a public service announcement via video, which began: ""First of all, I know this virus is causing a lot of concern, and rightfully so. Let me assure you of this: the world’s best public health officials are right here in Georgia at the CDC. They’re working around the clock to help contain this virus and to develop a vaccine.""



Perdue, March 23: The President’s early travel restrictions gave us time to prepare for the virus, and we’re continuing to take action to safeguard public health. We’re doing this by cutting red tape, partnering with the private sector to expand testing availability, and ensuring state and local officials have the resources they need. We’re also working on ways to help families and businesses that might be impacted financially.
Finally, please remember to follow the advice of public health officials: stay home if you are sick; wash your hands frequently with soap and water; keep a safe distance from others. If you are experiencing symptoms, call your health care provider right away. You don’t necessarily need to go there, just call them and give them your symptoms.

The Perdue campaign also pointed to a number of COVID-19-related actions Perdue has taken, including helping small businesses access the Paycheck Protection Program and helping to locate personal protective equipment for front-line workers.
The Perdue campaign also touted measures in the CARES Act, a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to bolster the economy in response to the coronavirus pandemic. It included direct payments to Americans, loans for small businesses, support for hospitals and more. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate. Perdue, of course, voted for it, although he opposed two of its major provisions: the direct payment of $1,200 checks to qualifying individuals and the $600-per-week in additional unemployment payments.
One one front, Perdue has been out ahead of, and clearer than, the president: encouraging the public to wear masks.
Trump has waffled on his support for mask-wearing from the start — saying on April 3, the day the CDC issued recommendations for public mask-wearing, that he would not personally be wearing a mask. In an interview in early May, Perdue said that in Senate meetings the week before, ""We all wore masks. We actually had a meeting before then (and) we had masks. And we have hand sanitizers, signs everywhere about washing hands and maintaining social distance. I think it’s very important that America sees that, that we are functioning, and that this is an essential part of life, that we work together.""
In an interview on Fox News on June 30, Perdue said, ""I absolutely support wearing masks. We wear them here in the Senate. We’ve been back here for five weeks. We follow the protocols that the military and our essential workers have been following. We wash our hands, we use masks, and if we follow that, I believe the infection rate can be managed.""
And on July 9, Perdue tweeted a picture of himself wearing a mask and imploring the public to ""wear a mask, wash your hands, practice social distancing.""
That was 11 days before Trump did the same thing.
In Ossoff’s ad, a chart shows the rising COVID-19 death count, while Trump and Perdue comment about the virus. But the chart is misleading. For example, when Perdue said ""the risk of this virus … still remains low,"" the chart shows the number of deaths increasing from about 15,000 to 83,000. But, as we said, that comment was made when there were about 1,500 cases and about 37 deaths nationwide (and just 17 cases and no deaths in Georgia). Similarly, the graphic shows the death count rising from about 180,000 to about 210,000 when Perdue said ""the numbers projected were supposed to be much worse"" — when, in fact, there were 54,761 deaths at the time of his remarks on April 28.
That puts Perdue’s comments in a worse light. Still, Perdue’s comments comparing COVID-19 to the flu, praising Georgia’s early reopening plan and crediting Trump for keeping the death count below projections are all flawed. But again, we’ll let readers determine for themselves if those comments prove Perdue ""ignored the medical experts"" and ""downplayed the crisis.""

		Falsely citing ""studies,"" President Donald Trump has suggested that there are few novel coronavirus cases in ""malaria countries"" because of the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine. But no such studies exist, and the drug is not widely used for malaria in much of the world.
Trump has aggressively promoted hydroxychloroquine for weeks, despite limited evidence at this point that it is safe or effective to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. And he has latched on to indications it could be working — even if the basic facts undermine his argument.
""It is extremely unlikely that relatively low rates of the [coronavirus] infection in sub-Saharan Africa are related to the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,"" Michigan State University malaria researcher Terrie Taylor told us, also referring to a similar malaria drug Trump has pushed as a COVID-19 treatment. ""Neither has been the first-line treatment for malaria illness for many years.""
Trump first suggested hydroxychloroquine was behind other nations’ low COVID-19 counts in a March 23 coronavirus press briefing. ""And countries with malaria have had a interesting thing happen,"" he said. ""They take this particular drug — it’s a very powerful drug — and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries. And there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the malaria.""
He broached the idea again in another press briefing on April 4 after falsely claiming that ""people with lupus,""  who also take hydroxychloroquine to treat symptoms of their disease, ""aren’t catching this horrible virus.""
As we have written, it’s not yet known whether lupus patients taking the drug are less susceptible to infection with the new virus. But it’s clear that being on the drug is not a panacea. Registry data from early April show that a quarter of patients with rheumatic diseases who have contracted COVID-19 were already taking hydroxychloroquine.
Trump, April 4: And there’s also other studies, you know, with the malaria, that the malaria countries have very little — people that take this drug for malaria, which is very effective for malaria — that those countries have very little of this virus. I don’t know. You’re going to check it out.
As we did with Trump’s lupus remarks, we did check it out. We could find no studies that back his claim, and experts we consulted were also unaware of any such studies. The White House did not respond to our request for more information.
Sub-Saharan Africa
It’s nevertheless true that many countries where malaria is common, including much of sub-Saharan Africa, haven’t reported a lot of COVID-19 cases — at least not yet. 
Global tallies from the World Health Organization show that the day Trump made his latest remarks, the African region had fewer than 5,500 confirmed coronavirus cases and only 170 deaths, out of more than 1 million cases and nearly 57,000 deaths worldwide. As of April 8, the count had risen to more than 7,600 cases and 326 deaths.
Malaria, which is caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, occurs in other places, dictated in large part by climate and season. But as the WHO says, the African region has a ""disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden,"" including 93% of all cases and 94% of deaths in 2018. On April 4, only 680 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the six African nations that collectively account for more than half of the world’s malaria cases.
There’s little reason, however, to think that’s because of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, for the simple fact that few people in malaria-prone countries are taking the drugs.
Chloroquine was once the go-to drug for malaria treatment in Africa, Taylor explained, but is no longer because the malaria parasite evolved and developed resistance to the drug. Hydroxychloroquine, which is a slightly modified version of chloroquine that is generally considered to be safer, suffers from the same problem; Taylor said it never has been a first-line malaria treatment in Africa.
""WHO and the various national malaria control programmes across the continent all recommend artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for the first line treatment of uncomplicated malaria,"" Taylor said in an email from Malawi, a small landlocked country in southeastern Africa. ""There are a number of different approved combination drugs, and each country has made its own policy recommendations — but no African country recommends that malaria patients receive chloroquine now.""
Chloroquine, she added, ""has virtually disappeared from many of these countries.""
In Malawi, where Taylor is doing research, getting chloroquine is ""actually quite difficult,"" she said, because it’s been withdrawn from the national formulary and is ""only available by special request.""
Miriam Laufer, a malaria researcher and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland, told us that chloroquine is ""still available in the private sector in some countries, like Nigeria, but it is not used routinely for treatment of malaria and is not part of national treatment policies."" 
Laufer agreed with Taylor that it would be extremely unlikely that the low numbers of COVID-19 cases in sub-Saharan Africa would be due to the use of these drugs.
Where Chloroquine Is Used
Ric Price, a professor of global health at the Menzies School of Health Research in Australia, also told us it was ""highly implausible"" that antimalarials were responsible for the lower COVID-19 counts in countries with malaria. 
""You would have to have enough of the population being treated for malaria,"" he said in an email, ""and residual levels of the drug staying in the blood for weeks to provide protection against the virus.""
While chloroquine is still used to treat malaria in some countries to target a different species of parasite that largely remains sensitive to the drug, Price said only a tiny fraction of the populations in those countries would be on the medication for malaria treatment — and ""almost no one"" would be taking drugs for prevention.
Price calculated that at best, less than 0.5% of those populations would have taken chloroquine at some point in the past year.
Then there is the issue of timing and dosing of chloroquine. ""It hangs around for a few weeks in blood,"" Price said, ""but will only provide protection from malaria for a week (max 4 weeks)."" 
Even if chloroquine is effective against COVID-19, far fewer than 0.5% of the population would have taken the drug at the right time to be protected. And as Price noted, lab studies suggest that compared with malaria, much more of the drug is needed to have any effect on the virus, so the amounts people might have taken are ""highly unlikely to have any impact.""
The WHO also has cautioned that the dosages for malaria are different than those being explored for COVID-19. 
""In the context of the COVID-19 response, the dosage and treatment schedules for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that are currently under consideration do not reflect those used for treating patients with malaria,"" the WHO website says. ""The ingestion of high doses of these medicines may be associated with adverse or seriously adverse health outcomes.""
Other Reasons For Few Cases
Finally, while current maps of the coronavirus pandemic might make it look like much of Africa is escaping relatively unscathed, many are bracing for a surge. 
""I’m pretty confident that COVID-19 is going to become an important epidemic in Africa,"" said Peter Hotez, a professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in a phone interview. ""It’s just that there hasn’t been much monitoring and testing.""
Price also suspects testing will be a problem. ""I very much doubt we will see any of the real picture of Covid19 in poor malaria endemic countries,"" he said, ""because they will be testing a tiny fraction of [the] number.""
The WHO, which has been worried since the start of the outbreak about the damage the virus might inflict on Africa’s weaker health systems, issued a press release on April 7 noting that the virus ""was slow to reach the continent compared to other parts of the world,"" but that ""infection has grown exponentially in recent weeks and continues to spread."" The continent’s first case was identified on Feb. 14 in Egypt, nearly a month after the first U.S. case.
The dearth of cases — if in fact real, and not due to a lack of testing — could stem from a variety of factors, including differences in international travel or possibly even the climate. 
As we’ve previously explained, there is some precedent for virus transmission to wane as it becomes hotter and more humid, although it’s not known yet if this applies to the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. A recent summary of the latest research on the topic from the National Academies of Sciences notes that in the lab, SARS-CoV-2 seems to survive less well under higher temperatures and humidity levels, but it’s less clear whether that has any impact on virus transmission in the real world — and countries currently in ""summer"" climates have still seen the virus spread. 
If climate does turn out to be important for this virus, the very conditions that allow malaria to flourish could help limit the extent of the outbreak in certain countries.
Experts, however, caution against coming to any premature conclusions. ""The potential explanations for why sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind other countries vis-a-vis COVID19 are fueling LOTS of conversations and speculation,"" said Taylor.
Only time and more testing, plus ""some epidemiological rigor,"" she said, will tell.

There is no evidence that a door-to-door campaign to encourage vaccinations against COVID-19 means President Joe Biden and Democrats ""are coming to your front door to force you to take the vax,"" as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted. She also cited a figure for reported deaths after vaccination, which is not the same as deaths caused by vaccination.

              Could a COVID-19 vaccine become mandatory?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              States and certain workplaces can require individuals to be vaccinated.
As legal and public health expert Joanne Rosen of Johns Hopkins University has explained, the legal precedent for states to make vaccinations compulsory goes back to a 1905 Supreme Court case involving the smallpox vaccine. The court sided with the state, finding that the vaccination requirement was a reasonable regulation to protect public health.
Employers are also allowed to require their workers to get a vaccine, if vaccination is reasonably related to a person’s job, such as in the health care industry. In guidance issued in December 2020, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission implied that all employers can have a mandatory vaccination policy, including for COVID-19, as long as employers comply with federal laws stipulating that reasonable accommodations should be made for workers who cannot be immunized because of a disability or religious reason. The matter is likely to be tested in court, as we’ve explained, because the COVID-19 vaccines have yet to be fully licensed.
The federal government cannot issue a vaccine mandate, Rosen told us, but could provide financial incentives for states to do so.
""[T]he Supreme Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment to prevent the federal government from commandeering or requiring state officers to carry out federal directives,"" the Congressional Research Service explained in a 2019 report. ""In the context of vaccination, this principle prevents Congress from requiring states or localities to pass mandatory vaccination laws, but it does not impede Congress from using its Spending Clause authority to provide incentives (in the form of federal grants) to states to enact laws concerning vaccination.""

              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

Full Story
President Joe Biden announced July 6 that the next phase of his administration’s outreach program to get more Americans vaccinated against COVID-19 will include community volunteers knocking on doors to inform people about the safety and efficacy of the available vaccines and to let them know where they can get a vaccination.
Based on that announcement, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene made the unfounded claim that Biden and other Democrats will ""force"" unvaccinated people to get a shot.
In a July 9 tweet, the Republican lawmaker wrote: ""5,946 reported deaths after taking the #COVID19 vaccine. The vaccine is NOT FDA approved. 33,631,656 Americans SURVIVED covid. But Biden & the Dems are coming to your front door to force you to take the vax, schools say your healthy kids need it, and you still think your free?""
But there is no evidence that the White House will require anyone whose home is visited to be vaccinated as part of the outreach effort. 
Greene’s other claims — about the number of reported deaths after vaccination, the approval status of the vaccines and the number of people who have survived COVID-19 — lack important context and could mislead readers.


Going Door to Door
In his July 6 remarks, Biden said that although nearly 160 million U.S. residents are fully vaccinated and more than 180 million have received at least one vaccine dose, ""millions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected"" against COVID-19.
For that reason, he said, his administration will continue to focus on different ways to get even more of the population immunized.


""Because here’s the deal: We are continuing to wind down the mass vaccination sites that did so much in the spring to rapidly vaccinate those eager to get their first shot — and their second shot, for that matter, if they needed a second,"" Biden said. ""Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus.""
He added: ""Look, equity, equality — it remains at the heart of our responsibility of ensuring that communities that are the hardest hit by the virus have the information and the access to get vaccinated. So, as we shift from these centralized mass — mass vaccination sites, where we were doing thousands of people a day, we’re going to put even more emphasis on getting vaccinated in your community, close to home, conveniently at a location you’re already familiar with.""
Biden said this approach would make it so that more people can get vaccinated at their local pharmacy, doctor’s office, job or a nearby mobile clinic.
However, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has made it clear that the federal government will not require anyone to be vaccinated against their wishes.
""What we’re doing is local officials are going to areas where there are lower vaccination rates and providing information on where people can get access to a vaccine, where they can go, that it’s free,"" Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One on July 7. ""It’s up to individuals to decide whether they want to get vaccinated or not.""
That was after she made similar comments about individuals having a choice to get vaccinated in a CNN interview earlier that same day.

Psaki and members of the White House COVID-19 response team have explained that the ""trusted messengers"" who will be going door to door to provide information about the vaccines will be doctors, faith and community leaders, and other volunteers — not federal employees. She said the campaign is actually a continuation of an effort that has been ongoing since at least April.
""So, those are the people who are the trusted messengers around the country. And we believe that we need to empower these individuals to continue to work in communities to make sure people know that these vaccines are safe, that they can save lives,"" Psaki said in a July 8 press briefing.
Even before the first vaccines were rolled out in mid-December, Biden himself said on Dec. 4 that he would not federally mandate that Americans get a vaccine when he became president.
""No, I don’t think it should be mandatory,"" then-President-elect Biden said in response to a question about possible vaccine mandates. ""I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power, just like I don’t think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide, I’ll do everything in my power as president of [the] United States to encourage people to do the right thing.""
In a July 12 press briefing, Psaki reaffirmed that the federal government would not mandate vaccinations — although, she said the administration would support entities that do require the shots.
""That’s not a decision that we are making. That’s not a — that is not our intention from the federal government,"" she said in response to a question about local mandates. ""There will be decisions made by private-sector entities, by universities, by educational institutions, and even perhaps by local leaders, should they decide that is how to keep their community safe. If they decide to make that decision, we certainly support them in that step.""
We asked Greene’s office for support for her claim that vaccinations would be required as part of the door-to-door campaign. We have not yet received a reply.
Greene’s Other Claims
The freshman Republican congresswoman from Georgia made other claims in her tweet that we have previously addressed.
She said there have been ""5,946 reported deaths after taking the #COVID19 vaccine,"" leaving the misleading impression that the deaths were caused by the vaccines.
It is true that 5,946 deaths were reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, as of July 6. But ""[r]eports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states on its website.
As we’ve written before, anyone can submit a report of an adverse event to VAERS regardless of whether the vaccine was a factor. In the case of deaths, health care providers are required to ""report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause,"" the CDC says.
""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the CDC said of death reports. ""However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event—blood clots with low platelets—which has caused deaths.""
As of July 6, the Food and Drug Administration and CDC had identified 38 cases of the rare blood clotting condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS. There have been three deaths from the condition among those cases, as of May 7.
Greene also tweeted that ""the vaccine is NOT FDA approved"" — which is true, but misleading.


As we’ve noted, the FDA has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines — including the one manufactured by Johnson & Johnson — for emergency use. In order to grant an emergency use authorization, regulators must determine that the product ""may be effective"" and the ""known and potential benefits of a product outweigh its known and potential risks"" – a standard that is typically less stringent than the standard full licensure, which is called a biologics license application, or BLA. 
 However, for the three COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA set up more rigorous EUA requirements that resemble the process for a BLA. The FDA required ""at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner"" and wanted to see at least two months of follow-up data on half or more of the participants.
Greene disregards the rigorous clinical trials and real-world evidence that show the vaccines have been safe and effective.
According to CDC data, the seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from COVID-19 has declined by about 94% since the vaccines became available in the U.S. The seven-day average of daily deaths was 2,779 on Dec. 14; as of July 11, it was down to 176.
Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna have filed for final approval of their vaccines.
Finally, while claiming that ""33,631,656 Americans SURVIVED covid,"" Greene did not acknowledge that more than 600,000 U.S. deaths have been attributed to the disease. Even some individuals who have survived an infection have reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and side effects that persist for months.
What’s more, only a small percentage of recent COVID-19 deaths have been people who were vaccinated, according to government data.
In a July 1 White House COVID-19 response team briefing, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that ""preliminary data from a collection of states"" since January ""suggest 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in these states have occurred in unvaccinated people.""
""With vaccines available across the country, the suffering and loss we are now seeing is nearly entirely avoidable,"" she said.
Walensky’s remarks are in line with an Associated Press analysis that found that ""nearly all"" of the people in the U.S. who died from COVID-19 in May were not vaccinated.
About 150 out of more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths that month were in fully vaccinated people. ""That translates to about 0.8%, or five deaths per day on average,"" the AP reported.
The news service also said that fully vaccinated people accounted for less than 1,200 — or about 1.1% — of more than 107,000 COVID-19 related hospitalizations that month.
Update, July 21: On July 19, Twitter announced that it would suspend Greene’s personal Twitter account for 12 hours for violating its COVID-19 misleading information policy.
In one of the July 18 and July 19 tweets that led to the temporary ban, the congresswoman falsely claimed that SARS-CoV-2 ""is not dangerous for non-obese people and those under 65,"" and misleadingly added that there have been ""6,000 vax related deaths.""
As of July 19, there had been nearly 607,000 COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC. While obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization and death, some who have died were of a healthy weight. And more than 123,000 of the deaths, as of July 14, were people under age 65.
In addition, as we previously wrote, thousands of deaths were reported to the VAERS monitoring system after vaccination, but that doesn’t mean the vaccine was the cause.

      Trump’s COVID-19 Testing Claim Is Way Off

		The United States has not done more COVID-19 testing than ""every country combined,"" as President Donald Trump claimed in remarks during a recent press briefing.
In fact, three countries alone — Russia, Germany and Italy — have done more combined testing than the U.S., according to a reference website tracking global testing for the disease.
The president most recently made the false statement at an April 28 White House event highlighting the federal Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. But he has been making a version of the claim for more than a week. (We’re not the first to point out he’s wrong.)
Trump, April 28: We are way ahead on testing. We are the best in the world on testing. We’ve tested much more than anybody else, times two — or every country combined. We’ve tested more than every country combined.
As of the afternoon of April 29, the U.S had done almost 6.03 million tests for the disease, according to data collected by Worldometer, a widely cited data aggregation website. (The website’s ""about"" page says it is run by an ""international team of developers, researchers, and volunteers"" and ""published by a small and independent digital media company based in the United States."")
The U.S. total is indeed more than any single country has reportedly done — but not more than all other countries combined.
Adding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy — the next three countries that have done the most testing — would produce a higher figure (about 7.29 million) than the U.S. total. And, overall, there have been nearly 25 million tests performed by the 172 non-U.S. countries for which Worldometer has data.
So, Trump’s claim is not even close to being accurate.
We would also note — as we have before — that the U.S. trails many countries in terms of testing on a per-capita basis, according to multiple sources.
Worldometer, for example, shows the U.S. doing 18,216 tests per 1 million people, as of April 29. But that was a lower figure than those of 41 other countries.
That is something else to consider when the president boasts that the U.S. — which is the third most populous country — has done a lot more testing than any other nation.

		Quick Take
A viral Facebook post about COVID-19 falsely claims that in New York ""every contaminated corpse belongs to the state"" and will be incinerated without any ""wakes or memorial services to pay your last respects."" The state is allowing funeral services with limited visitors; cremation is not mandated.


Full Story 
New York state has reported more than 100,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and nearly 3,000 deaths. New York City in particular has been described as an epicenter for the outbreak in the U.S.
But as New Yorkers navigate the public health crisis, a viral Facebook post is adding further alarm by spreading misinformation about what happens when someone dies from the disease. The repeatedly posted image claims that those who die will become property of the state and be incinerated without any ""wakes or memorial services.""
That’s wrong, according to local and state agencies, as well as groups representing medical examiners and funeral directors.
The post uses a picture recently published by BuzzFeed News, which the outlet attributed to a New York City nurse, that is said to show COVID-19 victims in a refrigerated truck outside a city hospital.
""New York coronovirus victims,"" the post reads. ""They’re not letting you bury your own. There will be no wakes or memorial services to pay your last respects. Every contaminated corpse belongs to the state and will be exposed of in a incinerator.""
That’s not true.

Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, called the claim ""ridiculous."" Mike Lanotte, the director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, told us in an email: ""I have not seen or heard anything regarding that claim. We are still operating under the state’s guidelines.""
Jeffrey Hammond, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Health, noted that Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s March 20 executive order — which required non-essential businesses statewide to close — ""does not apply to essential businesses or entities providing essential services or functions. Pursuant to Empire State Development Corporation (ESD) guidance, essential services include ‘funeral homes, crematoriums and cemeteries.'""
""Thus, funeral homes may continue to operate and hold services,"" Hammond said in an email. ""However, they should postpone services when possible. If services must be held, funeral homes should limit the size of any services or gatherings to as few participants as possible (e.g. immediate family).""
Scott Schmidt, president of the New York State Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners, also told us that, to date, there has been no directive like the one described in the Facebook posts.
There is ""NOTHING stating the State owns any body and will incinerate it upon verification of being infected with Covid-19,"" Schmidt said in an email. ""Funeral Directors, Coroners and Medical Examiners have been briefed on proper handling procedures for such cases as have Cemetery and Crematory Operators.""
In New York City, there have been numerous news reports about how the volume of deaths has overworked the system and transformed farewells for families. The demand has required the procurement of mobile morgues and created backlogs for cemeteries and crematoriums. Some cemeteries are not allowing visitors.
But the state hasn’t forbidden funeral homes or cemeteries from allowing services altogether. While the state encourages services be postponed or limited to immediate family, as we said, its Division of Cemeteries notes that ""funeral homes and cemeteries may continue to operate and hold services.""
Lanotte, of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, said he was aware of ""some cemeteries that are no longer, for safety reasons, allowing visitors."" While a Daily Beast report noted one funeral home’s decision to end visitation, that does not appear to be a widespread practice across the city or state. Lanotte said he has not ""heard directly yet of any funeral homes ending visitations. I do know they have adjusted to the new guidelines and are offering private viewings/ceremonies for immediate family only.""
In some cases, funeral homes are following those guidelines but allowing those beyond immediate family to partake remotely by using Facebook Live or Zoom.

On Oct. 2, President Donald Trump revealed that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19. Here we answer common questions about the risks of the disease, treatments available and the shortcomings of testing.
What do we know about Trump’s risk of developing serious COVID-19?
Without knowing all of Trump’s medical history, it is difficult to know how dangerous his SARS-CoV-2 infection might be. On the morning of Oct. 2, news outlets reported — and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows confirmed — that the president was experiencing only mild symptoms. 
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany reiterated the symptoms were ""mild"" in the afternoon, though Trump was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and would be ""working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days,"" McEnany said. 
On Oct. 3, a source familiar with the president’s health, who was later revealed to be Meadows, suggested that Trump’s condition was more serious. ""The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care,"" Meadows told a White House pool reporter in a pool report issued at about noon. ""We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.""
The president’s doctor, Navy physician Sean P. Conley, gave a more upbeat assessment at a press conference Oct. 3, describing the president as being fever-free and ""doing great.""
During a press conference on Oct. 4, Trump’s physicians emphasized that he continued ""to improve"" but said that the president had been given the steroid dexamethasone, which is not recommended unless patients require supplemental oxygen. Trump also had experienced two bouts of low oxygen levels, they said, and had been given oxygen at least once, on Oct. 2.
Trump tweeted on Oct. 5 that he would leave Walter Reed hospital that evening at 6:30.
At 74 years old, Trump is at higher risk of developing a more severe case of COVID-19 than younger people. Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on data available through Aug. 6, show that people ages 65 to 74 are five times as likely as 18- to 29-year-olds to be hospitalized and 90 times more likely to die.
Other CDC data show that for the month of August, 6.5% of people between the ages of 70 and 79 who were diagnosed with COVID-19 died, and 18% were hospitalized, although some data on death or hospitalization is missing or unknown.
Trump is also a man — and males have consistently had worse outcomes, on average, than females — and his last physical showed he was mildly obese, with a body mass index of 30.5 (30 is considered obese). 
According to the CDC, obesity increases the risk of a severe illness from COVID-19 and may triple the risk of hospitalization. It’s not entirely understood why this is, but carrying too much extra weight has been linked to impaired immune function and fat tissue can also push up on the diaphragm, making it more difficult to breathe.
Most people, however — even those with risk factors — do not get seriously ill, so the president’s chances for a mild infection may still be good. He is also not known to have many of the other risk factors for serious disease, such as diabetes or kidney disease, and is likely to receive the best possible medical care. 
Scientists are just beginning to understand why certain people fare so poorly with a SARS-CoV-2 infection while others never develop symptoms or only get mildly ill. Recent research suggests that one difference, which may apply to about 14% of severe cases, is that some people don’t produce enough type I interferons early in infection. The proteins are key players in fighting off viruses and help kick off a robust immune response, although too much of them later on could be detrimental.
In some cases, a poor interferon response may result from people having antibodies that inappropriately target and cripple the interferon, whereas others may be due to faulty genes. The offending antibodies are much more common in males. Older people may also have defects in how their bodies mount this type of early, or innate, immune response.
Other research also indicates that older people are less likely to produce a sufficient T cell response to SARS-CoV-2. T cells are part of the body’s later, more specific immune response, and assist with producing antibodies and also kill off infected cells. With fewer of these cells, older patients don’t create a coordinated response to fight off the virus and are more likely to have poor outcomes.
What do we know about the president’s health?
The president’s doctor provided the latest update on Trump’s health on June 3. He said the president ""remains healthy."" Trump was 6’3″ and weighed 244 pounds; his cholesterol was 167, lower than the previous physical. (A reading below 200 is considered desirable.) His blood pressure was normal: 121/79.
About six months prior to that report, in November 2019, Trump made an unannounced visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which he and his staff later said was to conduct part of his annual physical. Conley’s memo said his summary included information both from November and an April exam Conley conducted.
The president was taking rosuvastatin, a medicine for cholesterol, finasteride, used to treat an enlarged prostate or hair loss, and aspirin daily.
In 2018, then-White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson revealed Trump underwent a coronary calcium CT scan that showed the presence of plaque. Dr. Rachel Bond of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York told CNN the score of 133 on the test indicates ""he certainly has coronary artery disease because calcium is present. But this is also common for someone his gender, race and age.""
Who in the White House has tested positive over the course of the pandemic?
Before Trump and First Lady Melania Trump revealed they had tested positive for COVID-19, Hope Hicks, counselor to the president, tested positive, as of Oct. 1.
CNN reported that three journalists who work at the White House, as well as a White House staffer in the press area of the West Wing, had tested positive on Oct. 2.
Nick Luna, a personal assistant to the president, tested positive, according to Oct. 3 press reports. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tested positive on Oct. 5, she said on Twitter. CNN reported that day that two deputies of McEnany — Chad Gilmartin and Karoline Leavitt — also tested positive.
Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, tested positive on Oct. 6.
Before these cases, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien tested positive in late July; campaign fundraiser Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., tested positive the July 4 weekend; and Katie Miller, Pence’s spokesperson, tested positive in early May.
Others testing positive for COVID-19 include an unidentified White House staffer, unidentified member of Pence’s staff, a White House valet, former acting chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Tomas Philipson, a Marine with the unit operating Marine One, and a cafeteria worker in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
Who has tested positive after attending presidential or campaign events?
In early October, others have tested positive for COVID-19 who don’t work in the White House complex, but have had contact with Trump and administration staffers through their work for his campaign or by attending events, such as a Sept. 26 Rose Garden event introducing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett.
Kellyanne Conway, a former White House counselor, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — both of whom assisted the president in debate preparations and attended the Sept. 26 event — announced on Twitter they had tested positive. Four others who attended the Sept. 26 event have COVID-19: Sens. Mike Lee and Thom Tillis, Rev. John Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, and Pastor Greg Laurie.
Trump Campaign Manager Bill Stepien tested positive.
Sen. Ron Johnson also tested positive, he announced on Oct. 3, though he did not attend the Sept. 26 event at the White House. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also has COVID-19; she last was around the president at a Sept. 25 event, according to the New York Times.
The city of Cleveland announced that it knew of 11 positive cases ""stemming from pre-debate planning and set-up"" for the Sept. 29 presidential debate. The city didn’t identify those individuals, only saying ""the majority"" were ""out of state residents.""
Before the recent spate of infections, six members of the Trump campaign advance team tested positive prior to a Trump campaign rally on June 20, and two more staffers tested positive afterward.
What COVID-19 treatments are available and how effective are they?
Despite Trump’s repeated insistence that great progress has been made on COVID-19 treatment, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for COVID-19 and only one medication has been shown in a clinical trial to improve mortality.
As we explained before, when Trump attributed an 85% decline in the case fatality rate since April to ""pioneering therapies,"" most treatment consists of supportive care. And as University of Pennsylvania infectious disease fellow Dr. Aaron Richterman told us in an email, ""We have a long way to go in our treatment.""
In a clinical trial, the antiviral drug remdesivir shortened the time to recovery among hospitalized patients to a median of 11 days from 15 days. The medication received an emergency use authorization, or EUA, from the FDA, but that is limited to use among hospitalized patients.
Convalescent plasma may be effective, but the jury is still out on that — and for now, the National Institutes of Health treatment guidelines do not consider it a standard of care and neither recommend for nor against its use. Like remdesivir, it too is only available under its EUA to those who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
The steroid dexamethasone is the only medication to have demonstrated a survival benefit in COVID-19 patients. As a drug previously approved for other uses, dexamethasone can be given to any patient off-label, but data indicate the drug is only effective for those who need supplemental oxygen — and may harm those with less severe cases. Accordingly, the NIH guidelines do not recommend dexamethasone in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen.
There is hope that a new line of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies will prove to be effective and could serve as a ""bridge"" until the arrival of a vaccine. These drugs are similar in concept to convalescent plasma, but are made of optimized synthetic antibodies that may be safer and more potent than the antibodies isolated from human plasma.
Although still being tested in clinical trials, at least two companies have announced positive preliminary findings. 
On Sept. 16, pharma company Eli Lilly released initial data from a phase 2 trial of its SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody that reported the therapy reduced the amount of virus in outpatients and also cut the rate of hospitalization.
On Sept. 29, biotech company Regeneron similarly announced that its antibody cocktail reduced viral levels and reduced symptoms among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Neither company, however, has published its data yet and the results should not be viewed as definitive.
Trump’s physician said in the afternoon of Oct. 2 that the president had received an 8 gram dose of Regeneron’s antibody cocktail ""as a precautionary measure."" According to Regeneron’s press release, that is the ""high"" dose the company is currently testing.
On the evening of Oct. 2, Trump started on a five-day course of remdesivir and on Oct. 3 was given his first dose of dexamethasone.
What are the testing procedures at the White House?
On April 3, the White House announced that anyone in ""close proximity"" to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence would be tested.
On July 21, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president himself is tested ""multiple times a day,"" but Trump contradicted that hours later. He said: ""I do take probably, on average, a test every two days, three days. And I don’t know of any time I’ve taken two tests in one day, but I could see that happening.""
On Aug. 3, Politico reported that executive branch employees were told they would be subject to random testing. A White House spokesperson told Politico: ""As part of our ongoing efforts to protect the health and safety of the entire White House Complex, randomized testing of Executive Office of the President staff, which has been ongoing for several months, will become mandatory rather than voluntary.""
News reports and Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski have indicated the White House uses an Abbott labs test, which can provide results in 15 minutes. Lewandowski said in an interview on the ""Today"" show on Oct. 2 that he received such a quick-results test twice this week when seeing Trump.
Why didn’t the White House’s testing regimen prevent the president from becoming infected?
Rigorous testing procedures can help identify cases and reduce the risk of an outbreak, but can’t ensure that no one will get infected.
As Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina explained on Twitter, frequent testing worked in the sense that the transmission chain ""is severed."" But, he added, tests are ""not prophylactics.""
""They alone cannot stop the test taker from getting infected. But can serve to stop onward spread from the tester,"" he wrote. ""To stop from getting infected, masks/social distancing are needed.""
It’s also important to recognize the inherent limitations in diagnostic tests. Even if someone tests negative, that doesn’t necessarily mean that a person isn’t infected — only that the test didn’t detect the presence of the virus at that specific time.
Given that it can take a few days or even longer for the virus to become detectable, a negative result means someone still could be infectious and other public health measures should still be taken.
The White House was reportedly using Abbot’s ID NOW test as a rapid test for screening staff. The test is a molecular test that looks for the viral genome in a nasal swab sample, but is faster and less sensitive than the standard PCR tests.
Mina said in an Oct. 2 press call that the test was very good — perhaps the best rapid test available. But no test is perfect, and the test is not actually designed to be used the way the White House deployed it. 
The FDA’s EUA was revised in mid-September to specify that testing is intended to be ""from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider within the first seven days of the onset of symptoms."" In other words, the test is meant for those who have symptoms, not for surveillance.
What is the status of a COVID-19 vaccine?
There are currently four companies running phase 3 trials of a coronavirus vaccine in the U.S. One or more vaccines may be available by the end of the year or by early 2021 to select groups, assuming the trials go well and the shots are found to be safe and effective. Members of the general population who are not prioritized for vaccination, however, are not expected to be able to receive a vaccine until later in 2021.
The leading company, in terms of timing, is Pfizer/BioNTech, which has enrolled 35,469 participants in its trial and given 24,298 volunteers both doses of its mRNA vaccine as of Sept. 28. It is the only company that still claims to be able to have an answer on whether its vaccine is safe and effective prior to Nov. 3.
Moderna’s phase 3 trial of its mRNA vaccine has enrolled 27,232 participants as of Sept. 25, 15,454 of whom have received two doses. Moderna’s CEO said on Sept. 30 that the earliest he expected the company to be able to file an EUA with the FDA is Nov. 25, with a wider approval coming perhaps in March 2021. 
Oxford-AstraZeneca’s viral vector vaccine trial is still on pause in the U.S. pending an investigation into a possible severe side effect in a volunteer in the U.K. 
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which also uses a viral vector, albeit a different one, began phase 3 testing on Sept. 23. It is the only candidate of the four to require only one dose and not to need subzero temperatures.

		Q: Does ibuprofen make COVID-19 worse?


A: There is no evidence that ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can make COVID-19 cases more severe. You should consult your doctor before changing medications.

FULL QUESTION
Is it true that using ibuprofen has been shown to worsen symptoms of Coronavirus?
I’m getting warning that Advil makes coronavirus condition worse in affected patients. Patients should only take Tylenol. Is there any evidence this is true?
Is it unsafe to use ibuprofen in the current outbreak of Covid-19 virus? Some state that it magnifies the symptoms of the virus by 10-fold?!
FULL ANSWER
Many readers have written in to ask whether ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, can worsen COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Other NSAIDs include over-the-counter painkillers such as naproxen (Aleve) as well as prescription-only pills such as celecoxib (Celebrex), which is used to treat arthritis.
The idea has been circulating on social media and also has been promoted to some degree by a few national governments. While there are some good reasons for certain patients to avoid NSAIDs generally, there is no evidence that ibuprofen — which is sold under the brand name Advil — or other similar drugs exacerbate the disease. Instead, the notion is simply a hypothesis that has not been tested.
Much of the hubbub over ibuprofen appears to have started with comments from the French health minister, Olivier Véran, who said in a March 14 tweet that taking anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen ""could be a factor in worsening the infection."" He advised people with fevers to take paracetamol, the European name for acetaminophen, or Tylenol, instead. He also suggested that people already taking anti-inflammatories should consult with their physicians.
A few days earlier, a letter published in the British medical journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine hypothesized that ibuprofen could make it easier for the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, to enter cells. As we’ll explain, that’s possible, but there is no evidence yet to suggest that’s the case. There could also be positive effects of NSAIDs on the virus.
Soon after, inaccurate messages sounding the alarm about ibuprofen flooded social media networks and messaging apps. One of the viral warnings many of our readers asked about claims a lab in Vienna found that the ""vast majority"" of people who died from COVID-19 had taken ibuprofen and that a nurse at Vancouver General Hospital said, ""Advil makes the virus 10x worse"" and ""kickstarts the virus into pneumonia.""
The message appears to be a modified version of a fake WhatsApp phone message circulating in Germany that also cited an institution in Vienna. The Medical University of Vienna called the messages ""fake news"" and told Politico that it had neither discussed the issue internally nor done any research on ibuprofen and COVID-19.
The name-checked Vancouver hospital has also been similarly targeted, with someone circulating a fake memo about ibuprofen and COVID-19 bearing the hospital system’s logo. The hospital system explains on its website that the memo ""was not an authentic memo,"" and told us in an email that they ""did not issue"" the message our readers asked about.  
After an initial news report that a World Health Organization spokesman endorsed the recommendation to avoid ibuprofen, the WHO clarified that it did not advise ""against the use of ibuprofen."" 
The group said in a tweet that in its consultations with physicians treating COVID-19 patients, it has not heard of any negative effects of ibuprofen beyond its known side effects, and that it ""is not aware of published clinical or population-based data on this topic.""


Other medical groups and health agencies also chimed in, iterating that there isn’t evidence linking worse COVID-19 symptoms to ibuprofen.
For example, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, said in a statement that more research is needed, but there currently is ""no evidence that ibuprofen increases the risk of serious complications or of acquiring the virus that causes COVID-19.""
Still, some governments are advising against ibuprofen for COVID-19 patients or recommending other medicines. England’s National Health Service, for instance, acknowledges that there is ""currently no strong evidence"" that ibuprofen can worsen COVID-19 symptoms, but recommends acetaminophen for people treating COVID-19 ""until we have more information.""
So how legitimate is the concern? Experts told us that it’s possible ibuprofen could have a negative effect on COVID-19 patients, but it’s purely hypothetical at this point.
Potential Mechanisms
To begin to think about whether NSAIDs are a good idea or not for COVID-19 patients, it’s useful to review their chemistry and what they do in the body. 
The drugs relieve pain and reduce fevers by blocking an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase, which prevents the formation of molecules called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins have a variety of effects, but generally promote inflammation, which is part of the body’s immune response.
In news articles, some scientists and physicians have proposed that ibuprofen or other NSAIDs could dampen the immune response to COVID-19 or otherwise make the infection worse, as some have contended is true for other respiratory infections. But as the NIAID has said, there is ""no conclusive evidence that taking ibuprofen is harmful for other respiratory infections.""
And scientists who study these mechanisms say it’s not necessarily the case that NSAIDs would tamp down the immune system and hamper the body’s efforts to eliminate a pathogen. That’s because while prostaglandins are thought of as pro-inflammatory, some can have the opposite effect. And it’s not always clear whether a more or less active immune response is better. While a patient wants a robust enough response to clear the virus, too strong of a response can be deadly.
""The prostaglandins suppressed by NSAIDs can be harmful or beneficial in an inflammatory reaction like the one that proves fatal in COVID-19,"" University of Pennsylvania prostaglandin researcher Garret FitzGerald told us.
In a letter published in the journal Science, FitzGerald called the French minister’s advice on ibuprofen ""misguided,"" and he outlined examples from the literature that demonstrate a number of different possibilities. 
In one instance, mice infected with a different coronavirus were more likely to die when a particular prostaglandin was reduced because the molecule played an important role in limiting an overactive immune response.
But on the flip side, one prostaglandin can inhibit replication of the SARS virus, which is highly similar to the coronavirus behind the current pandemic. And researchers have previously found that the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin can actually prevent the SARS virus from assembling its RNA genome.
There’s also some evidence that the SARS virus boosts prostaglandin production.
""Based on these findings, if we see a clinical signal, we can rationalize it,"" FitzGerald wrote, ""but therein lies the challenge. Many clinical anecdotes remain stalled in biological plausibility.""
In an email, FitzGerald cautioned that all of these pieces of evidence are from in vitro experiments in cells or in animal models with related, but distinct viruses. ""So the message is that we need to do the basic research with COVID-19 itself and carefully model different stages of the human disease to see if there might be a place for NSAIDs or that they make things worse,"" he said. ""We are a long way off a public health advisory either way.""
He also found the recommendation for acetaminophen to be curious, since it also acts on cyclooxygenase to inhibit prostaglandin formation, albeit to a lesser extent than standard NSAIDs. So if there is a problem with the drugs and COVID-19, that doesn’t necessarily mean acetaminophen is a good choice.
Other scientists agree that it’s plausible that ibuprofen could affect COVID-19 patients, but that it’s simply impossible to say without more research.
""You could imagine that by using NSAIDs that you do change the balance of these prostaglandins and other small lipid mediators, and that that changes your immune response,"" said University of Iowa coronavirus researcher Stanley Perlman. 
""That being said,"" Perlman added, ""there’s not lots of data showing that you make an interpretable difference in these levels, and then how that affects outcomes. So right now, it’s really more speculative than anything else.""
The other main hypothesis for why ibuprofen might be especially dangerous for COVID-19 patients comes from a March 11 correspondence letter in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. 
Much of the article, which was not peer-reviewed, discusses potential reasons why people with high blood pressure or diabetes appear to be more susceptible to COVID-19. The basic claim, which the authors later emphasized was only a hypothesis, is that these patients could be at higher risk because of the medications they take to manage these conditions. 
Drugs known as angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers, they said, raise the levels of a protein called ACE2, which happens to be the protein the novel coronavirus uses to enter human cells. As a result, the authors argued, the drugs might ""facilitate infection"" and increase ""the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.""
Ibuprofen is not one of these drugs, but got a nod in a single, unsourced sentence that claimed that it, too, can increase ACE2 levels.
That fundamental claim, however, appears to have little to back it. Rachel Graham, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, told NPR that there’s virtually no evidence that ibuprofen raises ACE2 levels.
Indeed, we could find very little in the literature to support the idea — just one study suggesting ibuprofen could increase ACE expression in diabetic rats, and nothing about an impact in humans.
Even if it is the case that ibuprofen raises ACE2 levels in humans, that doesn’t necessarily mean taking the drug would make people more likely to catch the virus.
""Virus entry into cells is a funny business because viruses need very, very little receptor on the surface of a cell to enter it,"" said Perlman. ""So if you went from having zero to some, that would make it susceptible, but some to more may not do very much."" 
Studies have shown that ACE2 is present in a variety of human cell types, including the epithelial cells that line the lung.
There is also some research to suggest that ACE2 may actually have a protective function — so it’s not a given that more ACE2 would be a bad thing for a COVID-19 patient. Although limited to a specific set of circumstances, one study found that ACE2 protects mice against lung failure.
""If there are effects on ACE2, ACE2 has both positives and negative effects in the infection by itself,"" said Perlman. ""So we just don’t know where it’s all going to come out.""
So, there are some possible ways ibuprofen or other NSAIDs might negatively impact COVID-19, but the biological plausibilities can also be spun in the other direction — and there’s certainly no evidence that ibuprofen makes the disease 10 times worse, as some of the viral messages claim. 
There are nevertheless valid reasons for COVID-19 patients to avoid NSAIDs, if only because of their previously known drawbacks. NSAIDs have gastrointestinal, kidney and cardiovascular side effects, which may be especially dangerous in very ill or elderly patients or in those with preexisting conditions. 
Stanford University pulmonologist Angela Rogers told NPR that most patients in the hospital for an infection would receive acetaminophen rather than NSAIDs, since those patients are at a higher risk of organ damage.
Given the side effects, Perlman said that not using NSAIDs is ""probably a good thing"" generally. But, he added, ""that has nothing to do with COVID-19. That’s just the way NSAIDs work.""
For his part, FitzGerald does not recommend NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients, but doesn’t think patients in chronic pain, for example, should stop taking their NSAIDs and switch to opioids.
Indeed, without more evidence, no one can come to a firm conclusion about the effects of these drugs on COVID-19. In the meantime, patients should not change their medications without speaking with a physician.

The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines authorized for use were found to be safe and effective in clinical trials and real-world conditions. A professor in Ireland baselessly claims in a video circulating on social media that they are not, and that those who get the vaccines will die as a result within several years.

              How were safe and effective vaccines developed so rapidly?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              The unprecedented speed of the COVID-19 vaccines was due to multiple factors.
Candidates for an mRNA vaccine — the technology used for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines — can be quickly designed once scientists know the genetic sequence of the virus and which protein to target. Researchers already knew from past experience with SARS and MERS, which are other diseases caused by coronaviruses, that the spike protein the virus uses to enter cells was likely the right one.
Similarly, Johnson & Johnson has been researching adenovirus-based vaccines — the technology its COVID-19 vaccine uses — for many years in working on vaccines for HIV and Zika, and its Europe-approved Ebola vaccine.
The testing of the vaccines was also sped up by consolidating some of the early testing stages. Companies typically don’t want to proceed with expensive trials until there’s a sign the vaccine will work, but the government took on that financial risk in many cases.
The phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trials were also fast because high levels of disease transmission meant COVID-19 cases quickly accumulated among trial participants. And production capacity was sped along by starting manufacturing even before knowing whether the vaccines would be successful.

              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
The mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 represent a new vaccine platform, but their development rests on years’ worth of research, including clinical trials. And while the vaccines were developed quickly in response to the pandemic, they have been proven to be safe and effective not only in standard clinical trials but in real-world conditions.
The vaccines in question use modified messenger RNA to provide instructions for cells to make spike proteins that then trigger an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The cells quickly break down the mRNA.
But as the vaccines are deployed around the country, some have weaponized their novelty to spread misinformation and unfounded claims about their safety.

In one case, a video clip circulating online shows Dolores Cahill — a professor in Ireland who until recently was the chair of the right-wing Irish Freedom Party — baselessly claiming that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines will cause widespread deaths in the coming years.
Cahill specifically alleges that ""anyone who’s over 70 who gets one of these mRNA vaccines will probably be — sadly die within about two to three years.""
""And I would say anyone who gets the mRNA injection, no matter what age you are, your life expectancy will be reduced to you know die, if you’re in your 30s, within five to 10 years,"" continues Cahill, a professor at the medical school at the University College Dublin who has previously come under criticism for spreading misinformation about COVID-19.
There is no medical evidence for such claims.
In phase 3 trials, the two mRNA vaccines authorized in the U.S. — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are fully vaccinated. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in March found that, in real-world conditions, the two vaccines were 90% effective in preventing infections. (For more, see our SciCheck stories ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine."")
The video clip of Cahill has been repeatedly posted and viewed by tens of thousands on platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and Telegram and is branded as coming from a group called the ""World Freedom Alliance,"" which Cahill helped found in November. In a video announcing the group’s formation, one member referred to COVID-19 as a ""hoax""; Cahill said the group would ""expose the truth of what’s going on"" in order to protect freedoms.
The clip now spreading online is taken from a speaking event in Belfast in March. The full video shows Cahill making a host of other erroneous claims, including that the vaccines ""contain nanoparticles and you can be tracked."" The nanoparticles (a unit of size) referenced are actually lipid nanoparticles, material that helps to protect and transport the mRNA to the cell; they are not part of a technology that can track people.
We’ll address some of Cahill’s unsubstantiated claims in the viral clip here.
Unfounded Claim of Future Deaths
It’s unclear what exactly is behind Cahill’s wild and baseless claim that the vaccines will cause all recipients to die within a matter of years. Our inquiries to Cahill went unanswered.
Meanwhile, Grant McFadden, director of the Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines, and Virotherapy at Arizona State University, told us in an email that ""the safety record for the mRNA vaccines is excellent.""
McFadden said that while ""we do not yet have long-term data in humans,"" there ""are no scientific reasons to predict complications in these new vaccines in the coming years."" He added that ""common health practices mandate that this will be monitored carefully for years to come.""
In a different video uploaded earlier this year, Cahill also predicts widespread deaths specifically from the mRNA vaccines by misrepresenting old studies unrelated to the mRNA technology.
In one case, she cites a 2012 study dealing with vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV (the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003).
""What happened in this study is that the animal models after [they] have been challenged got very sick and that some of them died,"" Cahill says.
As we noted in a previous story, those vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV were not mRNA vaccines, as Cahill implies. And while the study found that the vaccine candidates being tested caused mice to develop eosinophilia — a high count of a type of white blood cells — when exposed to the live virus, the animals didn’t die, as our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters have explained.
Moreover, that phenomenon, in which a vaccine can lead to worse disease when confronted with a live virus, was not observed in the animal or human trials for the COVID-19 vaccines that received emergency use authorizations.
Cahill in the earlier video similarly references another vaccine trial against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. That trial, from the 1960s, also did not involve an mRNA vaccine, as she suggests.
""Most of the children who were given this RSV vaccine, which had the same issue, most of the children experienced severe disease with infection that led to a high frequency of hospitalizations — and two children out of 35 died,"" she says. ""And the conclusion from this was that the disease was enhanced by the prior vaccination.""
""What people need to know is that with these RNA vaccines is that after you’re vaccinated, for the rest of your life, you will have much higher death as the children did with this study because you were vaccinated,"" she adds.
That case actually involved a formalin-inactivated vaccine candidate. Researchers did find that the design of the vaccine candidate resulted in poorly developed antibodies and that the immunized children who still caught RSV suffered worse symptoms than usual. Two children who were part of the trial died as a result of the enhanced disease; the trial stopped and no RSV vaccine has been approved.
But again, this type of phenomenon has not been seen with the COVID-19 vaccines granted emergency use authorization in the U.S.
""Neither COVID-19 disease nor the new COVID-19 vaccines have shown evidence of causing [antibody-dependent enhancement],"" the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia reports. ""People infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have not been likely to develop ADE upon repeat exposure.""
Some scientists who noted the possibility of this issue occurring, as COVID-19 vaccine development was underway, have since said subsequent data helped to quell those concerns.
Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of Baylor College of Medicine’s National School of Tropical Medicine, said in an email to us that he was among the scientists who flagged the need for researchers ""to be on the lookout for immune enhancement"" — including in testimony before the House in March 2020 — ""based on our work on SARS 1 in rodent models last decade.""
""But as we and others started doing non human primate vaccine trials for SARS 2 it never materialized,"" Hotez, also co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said. ""That’s why we do the science.""
Other Baseless Risk Claims
Many vaccine recipients experience pain at the site of injection, fatigue, muscle pain or headache, as we’ve explained. Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain, chills or fever.
A small number of people in the U.S. have had serious allergic reactions following receipt of the shots. That’s why the CDC advises that anyone who has previously experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection be monitored for a half hour after getting the shot. (The FDA also recommends against vaccination for those who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one of the ingredients of any of the authorized vaccines.)
In the video clip circulating online, though, Cahill suggests without evidence that recipients will go on to ""probably have allergy, neuro-cognitive issues, and inflammation, and of course infertility is the major one.""
We’ve previously addressed the lack of evidence for the claim that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility. While clinical trials did not probe the issue, loss of fertility has not been reported among thousands of trial participants and it has not been confirmed as an adverse event among the millions who have been vaccinated.
And as for the other supposed long-term effects, Hotez said ""there is zero evidence to support such claims.""
""Also there is not even a plausible mechanism, it’s just antivax gobbledygook,"" he said.
While Cahill’s claims about supposed long-term effects of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines aren’t rooted in evidence, there is support for the fact that COVID-19 itself can result in long-term health effects.
Hotez pointed out that some who contract COVID-19 suffer from what’s known as long-haul COVID and continue to report health issues well after being infected. Among such issues, researchers have found that some such patients continue to experience neurological or psychiatric conditions in the months following infection.

		Quick Take
Viral Facebook posts misleadingly claim that Florida, Georgia, Idaho, South Dakota and Tennessee have become ""mask free."" None has a statewide mask mandate — but individual cities and counties in each of those states do have orders requiring face coverings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. 

Full Story
As COVID-19 cases in the U.S. grew to more than 7.4 million — including President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump — and surpassed 209,000 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continued to urge measures to stop the spread of the pandemic, such as frequent hand washing and social distancing. The CDC also recommends that people ""wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in [their] household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.""
In early October, 33 states, as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had implemented orders requiring face coverings in public, according to information compiled by AARP.
Wearing a face mask, however, has become a polarizing issue in the U.S., with some Americans viewing the masks as a limitation on personal freedom. Viral memes on Facebook now misleadingly claim that in some states there are no requirements at all for wearing face masks.
""FLORIDA, GEORGIA, IDAHO, SOUTH DAKOTA & TENNESSEE ARE NOW MASK FREE!!!"", one post claims, and shows a photo of two women holding up their hands with the ""V"" for victory sign.
None of those states has a statewide mandate requiring face coverings. But it is inaccurate to characterize them as mask-free. Individual cities and counties in each of the states has orders in place that mandate face coverings.
In Florida, Miami-Dade County, Palm Beach County and Hillsborough County, which constitute about 21% of the state’s population, have mandates on face coverings.
In early July, a public health emergency order requiring face coverings went into effect in Boise, the capital of Idaho. Jefferson and Fremont counties began requiring face masks in August.
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, the most populous city in Georgia, issued an executive order requiring face masks on July 8. Other cities in North Georgia began requiring face coverings in late August.
Knox County, Shelby County, Memphis and Nashville, which account for nearly 40% of Tennessee’s population, have mandates on face coverings. 
On Sept. 10, Brookings City became the first county in South Dakota to require face coverings. 
In addition, the state health departments in Florida, Georgia, Idaho, South Dakota and Tennessee all recommend the use of face coverings in public settings.

		Quick Take
A tweet, shared by President Donald Trump, mischaracterizes a video that purports to show ""Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services."" The video actually shows a demonstration in Idaho against a public health order regarding COVID-19 requirements held by a church in a city hall parking lot.
Full Story
A church protest against a local public health order in Moscow, Idaho (population: 25,702), has gotten national attention since President Donald Trump retweeted a video from the event with a claim that falsely suggested it showed ""Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services.""
The president added his own comment to his retweet, saying, ""DEMS WANT TO SHUT YOUR CHURCHES DOWN, PERMANENTLY. HOPE YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. VOTE NOW!""
Neither the original claim nor the president’s comment is true.
We’ll start with the video.
Trump retweeted a post from Cliff Maloney, the president of a Texas-based libertarian group, that included a video of a man being handcuffed in a parking lot while a group sings in the background.
Maloney wrote: ""If you would have told me in 2019 that we were just 1 year away from Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services, I would have thought you to be insane. This is one of the most heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen. Pray for America.""
But that misrepresents what the video actually shows.
The event was not an outdoor church service. It was a demonstration against a local order requiring people to wear face masks or stay six feet apart in public to slow the spread of COVID-19.
On Sept. 21, Moscow’s city council had voted unanimously to extend that order until Jan. 5. Latah County, where Moscow is located, is at ""minimal risk"" for COVID-19, according to the public health district in north central Idaho. But average daily cases in the county rose from about 3 at the beginning of September to about 23 at the beginning of October.
Two days after the council vote, on Sept. 23, Christ Church in Moscow posted on its Facebook page an invitation to gather at city hall for a ""flash psalm sing."" The invitation said, ""We are asking folks to please not wear a mask.""
Before the demonstration, city workers drew marks on the pavement that were six feet apart so that singers could safely participate.
""The city had tried to provide an avenue for this event to take place,"" Moscow Police Chief James Fry told FactCheck.org in a phone interview.
Also, before the event began, officers told the organizer that police would enforce the public health order, he said, and the organizer repeated that warning to participants.
""As soon as he said it, everybody actually moved closer together,"" Fry said.
Police issued tickets to five people for violating the city’s ordinance, Fry said, and they charged two of those people for resisting arrest when those people refused to identify themselves.
Among those ticketed was Gabriel Rench, co-host of a political Christian podcast and a Republican candidate for a county office. Rench is the man being arrested in the viral video.
Two days after the incident, Rench was a guest on Glenn Beck’s radio show, where he described the event as a ""protest, as kind of a worshipful protest"" to the public health order.
Still, the falsehood that the video shows ""Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services"" continues to spread on social media.
As for Trump’s claim that ""DEMS WANT TO SHUT YOUR CHURCHES DOWN, PERMANENTLY,"" that’s not true, either.
The Democratic Party platform for 2020 includes a section on ""supporting faith and service,"" which says: ""Religious freedom is a core American value and a core value of the Democratic Party. Democrats will protect the rights of each American for the free exercise of his or her own religion. It will be the policy of the Democratic Administration to advocate for religious freedom throughout the world.""

		Quick Take
Facebook posts falsely claim that it ""took [President Barack] Obama ‘millions infected and over 1,000 deaths’ to declare the H1N1 flu a health emergency,"" but President Donald Trump ""declared a health emergency"" before the first coronavirus death. In reality, both administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths.


Full Story 
We’ve previously dissected President Donald Trump’s faulty comparisons between his response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and former President Barack Obama’s handling of the H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic.
But misleading comparisons persist, and recent social media posts twist the facts about the timing of emergency declarations for the two outbreaks.

""[I]t took Obama ‘millions infected and over 1,000 deaths’ to declare the H1N1 flu a health emergency,"" read a March 29 meme on the verified page of Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. But under Trump, ""coronavirus was declared a health emergency and public safety measures were in place before a single U.S. death occurred.""
That’s wrong. Both the Obama and Trump administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths relating to the novel coronavirus and H1N1.
The meme actually compares the point at which Trump declared a public health emergency and the point at which Obama issued a national emergency — two distinct processes. A spokesman for Turning Point USA acknowledged in an email that its ""social media team confused the two different types of emergency declarations.""
A public health emergency, declared by the secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, gives the federal government and states certain flexibilities, such as temporarily reassigning personnel, to respond to a major health issue. A national emergency declared by the president is more substantial and can provide access to significant sums of federal money and resources.
Turning Point USA deleted the image after our inquiry, but other posts of the same meme are still on Facebook, and the claim also migrated to Twitter (and back to Facebook).
Here’s an actual (albeit abridged) timeline for the emergency declarations for each pandemic.
Emergency Declarations for H1N1

The first U.S. infection of the novel type of influenza was identified in California on April 15, 2009.
On April 25, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern.
The next day, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. (It was repeatedly renewed.)
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first fatality from the outbreak days later, on April 29.
WHO declared H1N1 a pandemic on June 11.
By Oct. 5, an H1N1 vaccine was ready and the first doses were given in the U.S.
Obama weeks later declared a national emergency on Oct. 24, 2009. The CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said at the time that millions of people had been infected in the U.S. and more than 1,000 had died.

Emergency Declarations for COVID-19

The CDC confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., in Washington state, on Jan. 21.
WHO declared a global public health emergency of international concern days later on Jan. 30.
The next day, on Jan. 31, HHS declared a public health emergency for the U.S. in response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease.
Weeks later, on Feb. 29, the first U.S. death attributed to the virus was reported.
WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
On March 13, Trump declared a national emergency. As of March 12, there had been 40 reported deaths in the U.S.

In addition to being wrong, the posts misleadingly suggest that while Trump took decisive action on the coronavirus outbreak and put ""public safety measures"" in place, Obama failed to do the same when it came to H1N1.
As we’ve previously explained, the CDC began releasing antiviral drugs to treat the H1N1 flu on April 26, the same day of Obama’s public health emergency declaration, and two days later the FDA approved a new CDC test for the disease. By April 30, Obama formally requested $1.5 billion from Congress to address the outbreak (the Obama administration later asked for nearly $9 billion). And a vaccine was made available in about six months.
More than 12,000 people are estimated to have died from H1N1 between April 2009 and April 2010, according to the CDC. There have been more than 3,400 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the U.S. as of early March 31.

		Quick Take
A bogus meme on Facebook suggests that the news media has tried to pass off one man’s death, attributed to complications from COVID-19, as two separate cases. But the headlines cited simply focused on different parts of his biography.


Full Story 
Thousands of Facebook users are spreading a false suggestion that two different headlines show that a man’s apparent COVID-19-related death has been reported by the news media as two different cases.
The news reports behind those headlines, however, show nothing of the sort.
""Corona is so bad, this guy died twice! #FakeNews"" the viral meme reads. It contains two side-by-side, different headlines that were each paired with the same photo of the man, Lenard Wells, who died on March 21.
""69-year-old retired Milwaukee police lieutenant died from COVID-19,"" reads the left headline, which we found was reported by FOX6 in Milwaukee.
The headline on the right, from KIRO-TV in Seattle (republished from Fox13 Memphis), reads: ""University of Memphis professor dies from coronavirus, report says.""

But the stories both reported on the death of Wells; the headlines simply amplified different aspects of his biography.
Wells was an instructor at the University of Memphis and previously worked as a lieutenant for the Milwaukee Police Department. He worked on the force from 1973 to 2001 and also served as chairman of the State of Wisconsin Parole Commission, from 2003 to 2006, according to his curriculum vitae on an archived version of his website.
So the meme, not the news outlets, is spreading the misinformation.
One user wrote: ""Same man, from Milwaukee, and again, same man from. Memphis, DIED TWICE, from Corona. Democratic Socialist Media is spreading Fear."" Another caption read: ""Check out this fake media. Man dies twice in two different cities. Instead of one death now they have two deaths on the books for the scamdemic.""
The meme also shows an Instagram caption, from a user identifying herself as a family member of Wells, claiming he did not die from the novel coronavirus — it says ""He had health issues way before this even happened!"" and calls the media and government ""fraud.""
A Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office representative provided FactCheck.org with a summary of its findings, which lists the immediate cause of death as ""Complications of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection."" The office made note of ""Other Significant Conditions"" including ""Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary atherosclerosis, obesity.""
We tried to contact the Instagram user and members of Wells’ family to learn whether or not they dispute the office’s findings, but were unsuccessful.
Either way, the viral claim that the news reports have misrepresented one man’s death as two separate cases is undercut simply by reading the reports under the headlines.
The claim feeds into the unsupported theory that the official COVID-19 death toll has been inflated. As we’ve previously explained, experts actually think the official tally is likely an underestimate.
It’s worth noting that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that, based on current information, those ""at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19"" include those 65 and older, and people of all ages with underlying medical conditions — such as chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, impaired immune systems, severe obesity and diabetes, among others.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, addressed the interplay of COVID-19 and underlying medical conditions during an April 8 press briefing.
""Those individuals will have an underlying condition, but that underlying condition did not cause their acute death when it’s related to a COVID infection,"" she said. ""In fact, it’s the opposite. Having an underlying condition and getting this virus, we know is particularly damaging to those individuals.""

Headlines shared on social media distort the facts of a recent order by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that mandates face masks be worn on public transportation. The order doesn’t require that individuals wear two masks. CDC guidance issued with the order does say that cloth masks should be made of at least two layers.

Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Lab tests, for example, show that masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Analyses of people who came into contact with those with COVID-19 have also found mask-wearing to be associated with a reduced risk of contracting the virus. Numerous studies similarly document an association between self-reported mask wearing and control of the virus in a community or the implementation of a mask mandate and a subsequent decline in COVID-19 cases.
While each of these study types has its limitations, collectively, most experts agree that masks are likely to reduce transmission of the coronavirus and should be used by members of the public when around other people. Some research also indicates face masks can protect the wearer as well.
Masks, however, should not be viewed as fool-proof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. For optimal performance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people select masks that are well-fitting and multi-layered.

Full Story
Some independent experts are now advising that wearing two masks — such as a cloth mask paired with a surgical mask — in some situations could provide greater benefit when it comes to controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus. The advice to improve masks comes as the U.S. documents cases of more transmissible variants of the virus.
Whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will officially endorse the advice of double-masking isn’t yet known. Officials have said they are currently exploring relevant data, and a CDC spokesperson told us the agency hopes to offer additional insight next week.
(Update, Feb. 10: The CDC has now posted the results of a lab experiment that found that a cloth mask worn over a medical procedure mask can significantly improve the fit and effectiveness of the masks. The CDC’s website now suggests that form of double-masking as one modification for better protection.)
But the federal agency has not issued a ""demand"" that the public wear two masks, as a headline shared on social media claims.

A recent video by the ""Ron Paul Liberty Report"" on YouTube, viewed more than 18,000 times, was titled: ""CDC Now Demands TWO Masks – Science…Or Tyranny?""
That’s wrong. And those who watch the video are presented with a muddied take on a recent order by the CDC that stipulates that those using public transportation must wear a mask. The order went into effect Feb. 1.
More than seven minutes into the video, a co-host of the show, Daniel McAdams, shows a headline from ZeroHedge, an unreliable website with a history of peddling misinformation, that reads: ""Medical Tyranny: CDC Announces All Travelers Must Wear Two Masks, Threatens Arrest.""
(In an example of how misinformation spreads, ZeroHedge actually credits the faulty report to another website, ""Planet Free Will."" And that website had republished the story after it appeared on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.)
The ""Liberty Report"" video then points to a CNN report about the CDC’s order. That article said, in part, ""[t]he coverings need to be at least two or more layers of breathable fabric secured to the head with ties, ear loops or elastic bands — and scarves and bandanas do not count, the order says.""
The actual text of the order simply defines ""masks"" as ""a material covering the nose and mouth of the wearer, excluding face shields."" A footnote adds that, ""Masks can be either manufactured or homemade and should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures.""
The CNN report was referencing the CDC’s guidance issued with the order. That guidance says that cloth masks, among other attributes, ""should be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source)."" (Emphasis is ours.)
But a mask ""made with two or more layers"" is not the same as two masks, as the video and headlines claim.
Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told us the recommendation that cloth masks be made with at least two layers has been around ""for some time as one layer is not very efficient at filtering virus.""
In fact, the CDC’s own website instructed as much months before President Joe Biden took office — so it isn’t some new guidance related to the transportation order. A CDC page about face masks archived on Aug. 27, 2020, advised: ""Wear masks with two or more layers to stop the spread of COVID-19.""
Many face masks available for purchase are made with more than one layer.
The CDC spokesperson, Jason McDonald, reiterated to us in an email that the CDC website ""recommends wearing masks with 2 or more layers of washable, breathable fabric. If you’re wearing a cloth mask, the layers of fabric should be tightly woven and you should not be able to see light through it.""
He added: ""If the mask you have is a single layer of fabric, you could wear another one on top to achieve the recommended level of protection.""
In other words, you could double-up a cloth mask that only has one layer to create a covering that meets the two-layer recommendation.
Gandhi said in an email that her recommendation — through her work with Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech — ""is to use a cloth mask with a filter inside when indoors in areas where high rates of transmission are occurring. So, two pieces of cloth with a filter inside since the filter blocks the virus electrostatically and the cloth blocks it physically.""
It’s worth noting that while the text of the CDC order on wearing masks on public transportation says it ""reserves the right"" to enforce the order through criminal penalties, it said it ""does not intend"" to rely on such penalties — and instead anticipates voluntary compliance.
The ""Liberty Report"" video goes on to present a video clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci saying, ""There are many people who feel, you know, if you really want to have an extra little bit of protection, maybe I should put two masks on. There’s nothing wrong with that. But there’s no data that indicates that that is going to make a difference.""
That was during a Jan. 28 live-stream video with the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, went on to say that while the CDC had not changed its mask guidance, the agency would continue to review data on the issue. ""But the bottom line is, the minimum thing you need to do is always wear a mask under circumstances when you’re in settings, where you’re with people, or you’re in congregate settings,"" he said.
During a Feb. 3 briefing (at 23:15), he made a similar point, saying that the CDC would continue to update recommendations based on data. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky agreed, saying her agency was ""actively looking"" at the matter and ""more data will be forthcoming from the CDC with regard to the value of double-masking.""

		As President Donald Trump tells it, state COVID-19 restrictions are a partisan ploy, with Democratic governors purposely keeping their states closed, while Republican governors are opening.
In campaign speeches in states with Democratic governors, he implores them to open up, while either praising or making no mention of the COVID-19 mitigation efforts in Republican-led states, even though the restrictions are often similar. Such was the case with Trump’s comments in Bullhead City, Arizona, just across the border from Nevada, as he wrongly contrasted the reopening actions of both states.
""The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself,"" Trump said in that speech on Oct. 28. ""And Arizona you’re opened up, but Nevada, get your governor to open up your state please. Get them to open up your state. Nevada, get them to open. Get them to open it up.""
So by Trump’s telling, Arizona, which is run by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, is ""opened up."" But Nevada, run by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, is not.
But the reality is both states currently have very similar restrictions. For example, in both Arizona and Nevada, bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms are all open, but use is capped at 50% of capacity.
""We can confirm that Arizona and Nevada are in fairly similar places in terms of reopening,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking policy actions taken by states in response to the pandemic.
In fact, Arizona has slightly tighter restrictions in some areas. For example, large gatherings are limited to 50 in Arizona, but it is 250 in Nevada. 
(Trump has held rallies in both those states in defiance of state regulations. At his rally in Bullhead City, Arizona, Trump said he gets around those regulations by calling them protests. ""We don’t call them rallies anymore, we call them friendly protests because you’re allowed to protest,"" Trump said.)
Nevada is stricter than Arizona in one respect: Nevada has a statewide face mask mandate, requiring people to wear them in public spaces when they come into close contact with others, such as on public transportation or in a business. Arizona does not have such a mandate, and leaves it up to local governments to impose them, if they want. (Several states with Republican governors, however, do now have statewide mask mandates, as an AARP state-by-state guide shows.)
In his stump speeches, Trump often singles out Democratic-led states that he says are ""closed"" and need to reopen. His most frequent target is Michigan and its Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who Trump has likened to ""a prison warden."" But as we have written, Whitmer lifted the state’s stay-at-home order, on June 1, and despite Trump’s claim that ""the whole state is closed,"" the vast majority of Michigan’s businesses are open with some restrictions, as are churches and schools, although some of the latter are teaching remotely.
Trump also has falsely claimed Pennsylvania is closed, as he did Oct. 31 in Newtown, Pennsylvania, saying ""open up this state, governor, open up this state.""
But, as we have written, Pennsylvania has been largely open since July 3, when all counties in the state entered the green phase of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening plan. There are some restrictions: For example, as is the case in Nevada and Arizona, indoor dining at restaurants is limited to 50% of capacity.
It is true, Tolbert told us in a phone interview, that some states with Republican governors were quick to reopen in April and May. But to that point, those states had not seen the same surge in the virus that states in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and West Coast had experienced.
As the president encouraged and prodded states to lift restrictions on business closures in the late spring and early summer, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, faulted some of those states for opening too quickly, in contradiction of federal guidelines.
""There are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,"" Fauci said in July.
Fauci singled out Florida, run by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, as an example, saying, ""Certainly Florida I know, you know, I think jumped over a couple of checkpoints.""
Trump repeatedly praised states, such as Florida, that opened early even when some failed to meet the federal guidelines for reopening safely.
Since then, though, Tolbert said, ""We have seen a number of Republican governors re-imposing new restrictions,"" closing or restricting some businesses and restaurants and banning large gatherings.
""Now that we are seeing a third surge, we are starting to see some states take action,"" she said, including in both Democrat- and Republican-led states.
For example, in late October, as COVID-19 cases surged, Idaho, led by Republican Gov. Brad Little, retreated from Stage 4 to Stage 3, returning the limit for indoor gatherings back to 50 people or less and outdoor gatherings to 25% of capacity.
There are some notable exceptions, Tolbert said, such as North Dakota and South Dakota where the Republican governors are ""not taking action despite rising caseloads.""
But as he did in Arizona, Trump often draws a false distinction between the reopening efforts of states with Democratic and Republican governors.
For the record, no states are truly ""closed."" Both Arizona and Nevada lifted stay-at-home orders in May. Both states have amended their reopening plans in response to spread of the virus in their states, and both are currently in similar stages of being ""reopened.""

      Trump Spins ER Statistic to Claim U.S. Is in ‘Great Shape’ on COVID-19

		At recent campaign rallies, President Donald Trump has made the misleading boast that the U.S. is in ""great shape"" because 97% of emergency room visits were for something other than COVID-19. But the number is not as impressive as it sounds. Trump could have boasted of similar percentages — 93% to 96% — during the worst periods of the pandemic.
With Election Day a week away, the president continued his efforts to paint an overly rosy picture of the coronavirus pandemic in two Oct. 27 campaign rallies.
In each, Trump repeated the false notion that the U.S. is ""rounding the corner"" or ""rounding the turn"" on the pandemic and debuted a new statistic to ostensibly support his position.
""Thanks to our relentless efforts, 97% of all current emergency rooms visits are for something other than the virus,"" the president said before a crowd in West Salem, Wisconsin. ""You don’t hear these numbers from the fake news. Think of that, 97%.""
He touted the statistic again — almost verbatim — a few hours later in a campaign rally in Omaha, Nebraska, adding, ""Think of that, 97%. We’re in great shape."" 
The next day, in Arizona, the president used the same lines again.
Trump’s statistic is correct, but it’s not the meaningful indicator he presents it as. Even during the pandemic’s harrowing days in April, the percentage of ER visits due to a COVID-like illness never went higher than 7%. And the number, while lower now, has been on the rise. 
Moreover, public health experts do not think that the U.S. is in ""great shape"" — and a bevy of metrics show that the pandemic is worsening.
The Trump campaign did not respond to our inquiry asking for the source of the 97% number, but it likely comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the agency’s data tracker, which has data up to Oct. 26, around 3% of ER visits in the past week or so were due to a COVID-like illness.
While that may sound low, it represents an uptick from two months ago, when the figure hovered around 2%. 
The estimate comes from one of the CDC’s surveillance systems, the National Syndromic Surveillance Project, which in an effort to track potential COVID-19 visits, monitors emergency department visits for COVID-19-like illness in a subset of hospitals in 47 states. 
COVID-like illness is defined as a person having a fever and cough or shortness of breath or a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits that meet the symptom criteria but mention influenza are not counted in the tally.  
As the CDC explains elsewhere, the surveillance system is ""currently being affected by changes in health care seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine and increased social distancing,"" which changes the number of people visiting the ER.
The ER visit data also appear in a weekly surveillance report from the CDC known as COVIDView. According to the most recently available report, which covers the week ending on Oct. 24, 3% of ER visits were for a COVID-like illness. 
A graph covering the pandemic period shows that the percentage of such visits each week peaked at 6.8% in April before declining and then hitting another peak of 4.2% in July. That means that even during the worst periods of the pandemic thus far, Trump would have been able to tout that 93% to 96% of ER visits were not related to COVID-19.

The weekly report notes that the percentage of ER visits due to potential COVID-19 cases ""has been increasing since mid-September.""
The rest of the report strikes a cautionary tone. ""Nationally, surveillance indicators tracking levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation and associated illnesses have been increasing since September,"" the report concluded, referring to the virus that causes COVID-19, adding that COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths for the most recent weeks ""may increase as more data are received.""
In selectively highlighting a figure that sounds impressive, Trump misleads about the reality of the pandemic in the U.S., which by all indications is getting worse, not better.
A set of Oct. 25 coronavirus task force reports obtained by the Center for Public Integrity, for example, found that a whopping 32 states are in the ""red zone"" for COVID-19 cases — more than in any other publicly available report to date.
And according to the COVID Tracking Project, the seven-day average of new daily cases in the U.S. topped 76,000 on Oct. 29, blowing past the previous rolling average record of around 66,500 cases per day in July. The number of people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 is also climbing, and daily deaths are now up from fewer than 700 earlier in October to around 800.
An analysis from Johns Hopkins University also shows that over the past week, almost all states have shown an increase in reported COVID-19 cases.
As he has before, Trump has recently claimed, including in an Oct. 30 tweet, that the reason why cases are up is because of testing.

More Testing equals more Cases. We have best testing. Deaths WAY DOWN. Hospitals have great additional capacity! Doing much better than Europe. Therapeutics working!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2020

There is more testing now than earlier in the pandemic, but as a COVID Tracking Project blog post on Oct. 27 explains, expanded testing does not explain all or even most of the observed surge in cases.
""Since October 1, the seven-day average for new cases has risen 61 percent, while tests are only up 14 percent in the same period,"" the post reads. ""Meanwhile, the number of patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19 has risen 40 percent in October thus far.""
Indeed, the uptick in hospitalizations and deaths also demonstrates that the surge in cases is not simply an artifact of testing. 
Members of the Trump administration have said as much, including Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus task force member in charge of testing. ""We do believe and the data show that the cases are going up. It’s not just a function of testing,"" he said in an Oct. 28 interview on NBC’s ""Today"" show. ""Yes, we’re getting more cases identified, but the cases are actually going up. And we know that, too, because hospitalizations are going up.""


The number of daily deaths is much lower than the more than 2,000 people lost per day in April, but as we’ve noted before, deaths lag cases.
Some locales, such as El Paso, Texas, are reporting that hospitals are beginning to run out of space, with some setting up field hospitals or sending patients to less burdened facilities, including those out of state. Utah is drawing up plans to ration medical care, contrary to Trump’s claim that all is fine with hospitals and they ""have great additional capacity!""
We’ve previously explained when Trump made the same baseless claim that the U.S. is ""rounding the corner"" on the pandemic that public health officials and experts do not agree with that assessment. Those opinions have not changed. 
Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, for example, said in a Twitter thread that there ""is a new real and serious surge in severe COVID"" and called for leaders to take more steps to ensure that members of the public take more precautions to quell the outbreaks.
And in an Oct. 28 interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci repeated his concerns for the future.
""We’re not in a good place,"" he said of the current situation, pointing to the high number of daily cases. ""We should have been way down in baseline and daily cases. And we’re not.""
""We’re going into a precarious situation where much of what we’re going to be doing is going to be indoors as opposed to outdoors,"" Fauci added, referring to the upcoming months of colder weather for much of the nation. ""And wherever you go in the country — you call up, you talk to your friends in the trenches — they’re telling you that they’re seeing cases going up virtually at all ages, all groups, at the same time. That’s not good. And then the third thing you superimpose upon that, as we go into the holiday season, where naturally the tradition and the customs are for gatherings and traveling. Again, all a bad recipe for a tough time ahead.""

      Biden Video on Trump ‘Silencing’ Expert

		Over the weekend, the Biden campaign posted a video that claims the Trump administration silenced Dr. Nancy Messonnier for ""speaking out"" about the new coronavirus at a Feb. 25 press briefing. But the campaign’s support for the claim is awfully thin.
Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, has regularly led press briefings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and she continued to do so even after the Feb. 25 briefing.
The Biden campaign video, which was posted on March 21, features Ron Klain, who served as former Vice President Joe Biden’s chief of staff and later as the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator.
In the video, Klain accuses the president of responding slowly to the coronavirus pandemic and failing to listen to experts. The video plays an audio clip of Messonnier speaking about the coronavirus on Feb. 25.
""It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,"" Messonnier said, ""and how many people in this country will have severe illness.""
Her frank assessment reportedly angered the president, according to a Washington Post story cited by the Biden campaign.
""Starting the next day,"" Klain says in the video, ""Dr. Messonnier no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force. The president and the White House sent a clear message to scientists in the government — there would be a price for speaking out and speaking up.""
But it’s misleading to suggest that, as a result of her Feb. 25 remarks, ""Dr. Messonnier no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force.""
Messonnier is not a member of the task force, which was announced nearly a month earlier on Jan. 29, and she never attended a coronavirus task force press briefing after the group was formed. 
We searched C-SPAN, Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and White House websites and found that she did not attend any of the task force press briefings — either before or after her Feb. 25 remarks.
The Biden campaign provided no evidence that she did, either. Instead, it cited the fact that Messonnier had attended Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar’s Jan. 28 press briefing on COVID-19. ""After this [Feb. 25] incident she appeared in no more briefings with Sec. Azar, a core member of the White House task force,"" Biden spokesman Andrew Bates told us in an email.
But that Jan. 28 briefing was held one day before the task force was created.
The White House coronavirus task force, from Jan. 29 to Feb. 25, made three public appearances that we could find. Two were press briefings on Jan. 31 at the White House and Feb. 7 at HHS, and one was a briefing to the nation’s governors on Feb. 9 at the National Governors Association winter meeting.  
The CDC was represented at each of those briefings by CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who is a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Redfield also attended the task force meeting on Feb. 26 — the day after Messonnier’s remarks — so there was no change in the CDC’s representation at the White House task force press briefings.
It’s also wrong to suggest that the Trump administration silenced Messonnier to send a message to government scientists that ""there would be a price for speaking out and speaking up."" 
Messonnier has regularly conducted CDC press briefings — including the Feb. 25 briefing that was cited in the Biden video — and that didn’t change in the days immediately following those remarks.
Since Feb. 25, Messonnier led CDC briefings on Feb. 28, Feb. 29, March 3 and March 9. She also has appeared in videos on the CDC’s Twitter page on March 9, March 13 and March 14. Those videos have received between approximately 126,000 to 238,000 views.
The Biden campaign also cited a New York Times story on March 8 that quoted former CDC Director Thomas Frieden as saying, ""Nancy Messonnier told it like it is. And she was 100 percent right, and they silenced the messenger."" But Messonnier led the CDC press briefing the day after the Times story appeared, and she continued to provide a frank assessment of the impact of the outbreak in the U.S.
""This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person to person based on the available data,"" she said in the March 9 briefing, according to a transcript that was released the next day. ""The report of the World Health Organization mission to China describes the virus as being highly contagious. And there’s essentially no immunity against this virus in the population because it’s a new virus. Based on this, it’s fair to say that as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States will at some point in time either this year or next be exposed to this virus and there’s a good chance many will become sick.""
This isn’t the first time that the Biden campaign has accused the Trump administration of silencing experts during the coronavirus outbreak.
Biden, who is currently the leading Democratic presidential candidate, claimed in a Feb. 28 interview with CNN that ""Dr. Fauci is not allowed to speak publicly,"" referring to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. As we wrote shortly after those comments, government scientists were told to clear their public appearances through the coronavirus task force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence, but Fauci had spoken about the pandemic in numerous public appearances.
In fact, Fauci usually attends the White House coronavirus task force briefings, despite frequently contradicting the president.
It’s worth noting that Fauci did not attend the March 23 briefing — a day after Science magazine published an interview with the NIAID director in which he admitted that Trump has given inaccurate information at the press briefings. ""But I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,"" Fauci said of Trump. ""OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.""
There has been speculation that Trump is losing patience with Fauci’s candid remarks. It remains to be seen whether that is the case or not.
As for Messonnier, the Biden video misleads when it says she ""no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force"" after her Feb. 25 remarks, when in fact she never appeared at those briefings previously.

      FactChecking Biden’s ‘Breakfast Club’ Interview

		In a May 22 radio interview, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made a number of false, misleading or exaggerated claims.

Biden falsely suggested that he called for implementing nationwide social distancing restrictions prior to March 8, which Columbia University researchers said could have prevented nearly 36,000 U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 from then until early May.
He falsely claimed ""the NAACP’s endorsed me every time I’ve run"" for office. The president and CEO of the national civil rights organization issued a statement saying ""the NAACP is a non-partisan organization and does not endorse candidates for political office at any level.""
Biden exaggerated when he said ""I wrote an article"" about the coronavirus on Jan. 27 that ""said this pandemic’s here."" Biden actually referred to the outbreak as a ""global health challenge"" and argued that Trump was not prepared to lead the country through ""the possibility of a pandemic.""
He also gave himself too much credit when he said, ""I’m the guy that said we ought to … find out exactly how many people in the black community are getting COVID and are dying from it."" On April 9, Biden joined several Democrats who had already called for the federal health department to collect racial and ethnic demographic data on testing and treatment.

Biden made all of those claims during a roughly 18-minute segment on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio program. But it was a controversial comment he made about African Americans near the end of the interview — that ""if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black"" — that received the most attention.
The Study on Social Distancing
The Columbia University study, which has not been peer reviewed, was posted on the preprint server medRxiv on May 20. The study’s authors calculated that, had social distancing and other enforcement measures, such as stay-at-home orders, been widely implemented in the U.S. on March 8 — rather than in mid-March — 35,927 of nationwide COVID-19 deaths through May 3 could have been avoided. If those public restrictions had gone into effect even sooner, on March 1, the researchers estimated that 53,990 deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus could have been prevented.
What the study does not say, however, is that Biden suggested taking such steps, which is the false impression he gave during the interview when he said: ""They pointed out that if he had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with this virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead."" 
It’s true that ""others"" — including health officials in Trump’s own administration — said prior to March that social distancing would need to be enforced in order to slow the spread of the virus. We’ve written about some of the early warnings Trump got about how damaging COVID-19 could be for Americans.
But we asked the Biden campaign for an example of Biden calling for social distancing, or something resembling a nationwide lockdown, by early March — and it didn’t offer one.
In fact, Biden was still holding campaign rallies with large groups of people at that point. He reportedly spoke to a crowd of about 1,000 at a Detroit high school on March 9, the eve of Michigan’s Democratic primary, for example.
The next day, the campaign did cancel a planned rally in Ohio, citing concerns about potentially spreading the virus. But, after Biden’s primary wins on March 10, he still delivered a victory speech before a group of ""about 50 staffers, supporters, and members of the media,"" at an event in Philadelphia that was closed to the public, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Biden didn’t release his own plan to combat the virus until March 12. It mainly called for, among other things, making testing for COVID-19 free and widely available, as well as offering financial assistance for all those affected by the outbreak, including paid sick leave.
It was that same day when the Biden campaign reportedly issued a memo to staff instructing ""all Biden for President employees both in our Philadelphia headquarters and in field offices across the country"" to work from home, beginning March 14.
Of course, it wasn’t until later, on March 16, that the White House coronavirus task force issued its own guidelines for a 15-day trial to slow the spread of the virus. In a press briefing, Trump said: ""[M]y administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.""
The guidelines also encouraged the elderly, people with underlying health conditions and individuals who feel sick, or anyone in a household with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, to stay home. 
On March 29, Trump announced that the task force was extending its guidelines for an additional 30 days.
In a statement to FactCheck.org, Mike Gwin, a Biden spokesman, said: ""Starting in January, Vice President Biden repeatedly called on Donald Trump to take the threat of the coronavirus seriously, and to listen to the advice of scientists and experts in making necessary preparations and combatting its spread. Trump ignored Biden’s warnings, and failed to take quick action — and he refused to listen to public health experts in the administration who pushed for social distancing measures almost a month before they were actually taken. America has paid an unimaginable price because of Trump’s failure to act quickly, with 100,000 dead and the highest unemployment since the Great Depression.""
 No NAACP Endorsement
At the very end of the radio interview, in response to a comment Charlamagne tha God, one of the show’s hosts, made about wanting more for the black community, Biden said: ""I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP’s endorsed me every time I’ve run. I mean, come on, take a look at the record.""
But that’s false. 
In a statement refuting Biden’s claim, Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the 100-plus-year-old civil rights organization, said: ""Yesterday, former Vice President Joe Biden made a comment about the NAACP’s endorsement. We want to clarify that the NAACP is a non-partisan organization and does not endorse candidates for political office at any level. Persons affiliated with the NAACP at the national, state, and local levels are free to make candidate endorsements in a personal capacity, but they do not reflect support by the NAACP as an organization.""
The NAACP made its policy of not endorsing candidates known back in 2016, too.
Biden’s January Coronavirus Op-Ed
Earlier in the radio interview, Biden said, ""I wrote an article back, I think, the 27th of January said this pandemic’s here. We should act.""
It’s true that Biden’s opinion piece, which was published that day by USA Today, said the coronavirus outbreak would ""get worse before it gets better,"" and that there ""will likely be more"" than just the confirmed cases the U.S. and a few other countries had reported at the time.
But Biden didn’t write that the new virus had already reached pandemic status. Instead, he argued that Trump was not prepared to lead the country through what he called a ""global health challenge.""
In fact, the first line of the op-ed said, ""The possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president."" We added emphasis on the word ""possibility.""
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan. 30, and officially labeled it a pandemic on March 11. 
COVID-19 and African Americans
Biden also told the radio show’s listeners, ""I’m the guy that said we ought to take hard records and find out exactly how many people in the black community are getting COVID and are dying from it.""
But to support his claim, the Biden campaign directed us to an April 9 statement showing that Biden was following what other Democrats had already asked the Department of Health and Human Services to do. He wasn’t taking the lead.
In the post on the Medium, a publishing platform, Biden said, in part: ""This pandemic has shown us the importance of leading with science and following the data — but we can’t follow the data if we don’t have it. That’s why I join my Democratic colleagues Senator [Elizabeth] Warren, Congresswoman [Ayanna] Pressley, Senator [Kamala] Harris, Senator [Cory] Booker, Congresswoman [Robin] Kelly, and others in calling on the CDC and other agencies to release more data about how COVID-19 is hurting our communities. Not just data on age, but also on income and race, so we can focus resources on where help is needed first and fastest.""
Those Democratic lawmakers had already sent a March 27 letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, asking HHS and its agencies to pay close attention to racial disparities in the U.S. response to COVID-19.
""During this unprecedented global pandemic, affordable and equitable access to care and treatment is essential to saving lives and slowing the spread of the coronavirus,"" the letter reads. ""It is critical that the federal government make a concerted effort to account for existing racial disparities in health care access and how persistent inequities may exacerbate these disparities in the weeks and months to come as our nation responds to this global health pandemic. We urge HHS to work with states, localities, and private labs to better collect data on health disparities as we continue to respond to this pandemic.""

      FactChecking Trump’s Coronavirus  Address

		In a short primetime address, President Donald Trump provided false, misleading and incomplete information about the new coronavirus and actions his administration has taken or will take to staunch its spread:

In announcing new restrictions on travel from Europe, Trump inaccurately said that the U.S. would suspend ""all travel from Europe"" for the next 30 days, excluding the U.K. In fact, the policy exempts other nations as well, and only applies to 26 so-called Schengen Area countries.
Trump wrongly said that the European travel prohibitions would also pertain to a ""tremendous amount of trade and cargo."" Goods are not affected by the policy.
Referring to an earlier meeting about coronavirus-related health insurance coverage, the president incorrectly said that industry leaders had agreed to ""waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments."" Those leaders only agreed to no copayments for coronavirus testing.
The president repeated the disputed claim that his decision to impose restrictions on travel to and from China was a ""life-saving move."" Experts say that determination can’t be made without more data.
Trump said his administration has cut red tape ""to make antiviral therapies available in record time,"" without saying how soon. At best, an antiviral drug might be ready for production in June.

The novel coronavirus, which emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, has now infected more than 125,000 people across the globe, and led to more than 4,700 deaths. In the U.S., there have been at least 39 deaths and 1,500 cases. The pneumonia-like disease caused by the virus is known as COVID-19.
Trump’s speech from the Oval Office began shortly after 9 p.m. Eastern on March 11 and lasted just 10 minutes.
European Travel Restrictions
Trump’s biggest announcement of the evening was a set of new travel restrictions on people coming from Europe. But in his delivery, he bungled numerous facets of the policy.
Trump, March 11: To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval.  Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.
The policy does not restrict ""all travel"" from Europe, as Trump claimed, and does not only exempt the U.K.
Instead, as other administration officials later clarified or corrected — and as the president’s proclamation makes clear — the policy restricts travel for most foreign nationals who have been in one or more of 26 European countries that make up the Schengen Area in the past 14 days. The Schengen Area includes most, but not all, of continental Europe, and excludes countries such as Ireland, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.
Trump alluded vaguely to ""exemptions for Americans,"" leaving it to others in his administration to explain. According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the travel restrictions do not apply to ""legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.""
In a tweet that quickly followed the president’s address, the White House said that U.S. citizens and others who are exempt ""will be directed to limited airports where screening can take place.""
Trump is also wrong to say that the policy will bar the transfer of goods between Europe and America. The White House noted in a fact sheet released the same day that the policy ""only applies to the movement of human beings, not goods or cargo.""
The president’s own proclamation specifically states that the ""free flow of commerce between the United States and the Schengen Area countries remains an economic priority for the United States,"" and that Trump remains ""committed to facilitating trade between our nations.""
The president corrected himself after the speech, clarifying on Twitter that ""trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe.""
Coronavirus Treatment Copayments
In his national address, Trump also inaccurately summarized the results of a March 10 coronavirus briefing with insurance companies at the White House.
""Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of [the] health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing,"" he said.
The insurance companies present agreed to no copays for coronavirus tests, but they did not say there would be no copays for coronavirus treatment. 
Vice President Mike Pence, for example, said in the meeting, ""all the insurance companies here — either today or before today — have agreed to waive all copays on coronavirus testing and extend coverage for coronavirus treatment in all of their benefit plans."" Extending coverage for treatment does not mean that there will be no copayment for treatment.
Kristine Grow of America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, told us that because there are no specific treatments for COVID-19, symptoms are treated as for other infectious diseases. ""Treatment of symptoms for infectious diseases is covered, according to an individual’s benefit plan,"" she said.
Grow said the groups that committed to no copays for COVID-19 testing include the ""majority of health insurance providers nationally, which cover the vast majority of Americans.""
According to an AHIP website, some — but not all — insurers are also providing COVID-19 treatment without a copayment.
A White House fact sheet notes that ""health plans with health savings accounts will be able to cover coronavirus testing and treatment without co-payments."" Not everyone, however, has an HSA plan, which typically provides skimpier coverage or a higher-deductible plan, and allows individuals to make tax-free contributions for their health expenses. An AHIP survey suggests that as of January 2017, about 22 million Americans have HSA plans. 
‘Life-Saving’ Travel Restrictions?
Trump repeated the disputed claim that ""we made a life-saving move with early action on China,"" referring to his Jan. 31 decision to impose restrictions on travel to and from China for certain individuals.
A day later, the president estimated – without any evidence – that this ""boldest step of all"" had ""helped save thousands of lives.""
As we wrote earlier this week, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us there’s no evidence that the travel restrictions have saved lives or reduced the number of cases in the U.S.
""We have not seen any evidence that shows the travel restrictions stopped or slowed down transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19,"" Nuzzo told us in an email. ""It is possible that it did, but there is no evidence to show this. Rather there are a number of reasons to believe that this may very well not be the case.""
In addition, on March 6, the journal Science published a modeling study that concluded, according to the press release, ""In areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), travel restrictions will only modestly impact the spread of the outbreak."" The study’s authors wrote that ""transmission-reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic.""
No Antiviral Drugs — Yet
There are no FDA-approved antiviral drugs for COVID-19. However, there are clinical trials underway, as the president suggested in his remarks.
Trump, March 11: We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.
The National Institutes of Health announced on Feb. 25 that it had begun a ""randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"" at the University of Nebraska.
""Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment,"" NIH said in a press release. ""It was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses.""
Phase three of the U.S. trial began on March 6 and is expected to be completed in May, the NIH says. The company has said it is also conducting clinical trials in China.
At a White House meeting on March 2, Daniel O’Day, CEO and president of Gilead Sciences, said the company hopes to know by April if the drug is safe and effective.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that — if all goes well — manufacturing could begin in June.
Trump, March 2: When will you know if it works?
O’Day: Well, I think we’ll know in the April timeframe. …
Trump: So it could be used as a treatment.  Somebody is sick, they have the problem.  Tony — it could be used — when do you think it could be used?
Fauci: Well, if the trial that Daniel is talking about proves efficacy, which you likely might know in a few months whether it’s … effective or not.
O’Day:  Yes.
Fauci:  If you know by June that it’s effective, then you just scale up and manufacture it, and you’re good to go.
Leonard Schleifer, president and CEO of Regeneron, said at the White House meeting that his company is working on a different type of treatment — a passive vaccine and therapeutic — that is in the pre-clinical stage. This treatment involves injecting an antibody that would provide temporary protection from COVID-19 (what Schleifer referred to as the ""passive vaccine"") while providing a treatment to help clear the virus. Schleifer said his company could be ""producing 20,000 doses by the end of the summer of a course of treatment,"" he said.
The science news site STAT says the company has used this process successfully before.
""The last time Regeneron embarked on this process, during the Ebola outbreak of 2015, it came up with an antibody cocktail that roughly doubled survival rates for treated patients,"" STAT said in a story on investigational treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.

      Trump Gets Ahead of Himself on COVID-19 Therapies

		President Donald Trump touted two drugs — including one currently on the market for other uses — that he said show ""really good promise"" as therapies to COVID-19. But he left the misleading impression that the drugs were ""approved"" to treat the coronavirus and available for ""immediate delivery.""
In fact, neither of the drugs the president highlighted at a press conference on March 19 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as therapy for COVID-19, though the FDA is moving forward rapidly with clinical trials.
The FDA is ""looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications,"" and that doctors can currently prescribe off-label. The FDA plans to study the results of those drugs in hopes that they can be offered as ""bridge"" therapies as they await completion of clinical trials for a vaccine, which may take a year, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said.
""We need to make sure that these — this sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time,"" Hahn said, speaking just after Trump. ""As an example, we may have the right drug, but it may not be in the appropriate dosage form right now, and that may do more harm than good.""
In a press release, Hahn said that while some of the therapies being investigated show ""promise,"" the FDA ""also must ensure these products are effective; otherwise we risk treating patients with a product that might not work when they could have pursued other, more appropriate, treatments.""
Chloroquine
Trump first mentioned chloroquine, an old drug used to prevent and treat malaria, as well as to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
Trump said it has shown ""very, very encouraging early results"" for use in people who have contracted the novel coronavirus. An article published in February in Nature found that the drug limited infection of the virus in cells grown in the lab, and the authors recommended it be assessed in human patients. It is currently being tested in clinical trials in China, where it is included in government guidelines for treating coronavirus patients.
Trump noted that because it has been around for a long time, its side effects are well known ""so we know that … if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody."" The president described the drug as ""a tremendous breakthrough"" and a potential ""game-changer.""
But he got a bit ahead of himself on the process.
""And we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,"" Trump said. ""And that’s where the FDA has been so great. They’ve gone through the approval process; it’s been approved. And they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription.""
""There’s tremendous promise. And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that, and it’s — it was approved very, very quickly and it’s now approved, by prescription,"" Trump said.
To be clear, chloroquine is not approved by the FDA for use on people with the coronavirus.
Hahn said chloroquine is approved ""for the treatment of malaria as well as an arthritis condition."" The FDA is considering an ""expanded use"" trial of patients in the U.S. ""to actually see if that benefits patients. And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and — asked and answered.""
According to an FDA press release issued after the press conference, ""The FDA has been working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.""
Hahn declined to speculate how long it might take before chloroquine — provided everything goes well in the clinical trials and the drug is deemed ""safe and effective"" — might be approved for use for COVID-19.
""We want to make sure that this is done well and right for the American people,"" Hahn said. ""The president is right. With an off-the-shelf drug, we do have a lot of information about the side effects of the drug.  So that really helps, in terms of expediting.  But — but I want to assure you that we’re working as quickly as we can.  I don’t want to speculate about a timeline at this point.""
In the meantime, if the drug show promise, the FDA says it will ""engage with domestic manufacturers to ramp up production of this product to mitigate any potential supply chain pressures.""
Remdesivir
As for remdesivir, Trump misleadingly said ""that drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA.""
That drug has only been approved for a clinical trial, not for consumer use.
On Feb. 25, the National Institutes of Health announced that it had begun a clinical trial ""to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"" at the University of Nebraska.
The trial participants will be randomly assigned without their knowledge either remdesivir or a placebo.
""It was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses,"" NIH said. 
As the president said, remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. Daniel O’Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, said at a March 2 White House meeting that the company hopes to know by April if the drug works.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that — if all goes right — the drug could be ready for mass production by June.
""[I]f the trial that Daniel is talking about proves efficacy, which you likely might know in a few months whether it’s … effective or not,"" Fauci said. ""If you know by June that it’s effective, then you just scale up and manufacture it, and you’re good to go.""

		FactCheck.org Deputy Managing Editor Robert Farley spoke with WBAL-TV in Baltimore and several other Hearst TV stations around the country about fact-checking the Democratic convention.
In interviews that aired on Aug. 21, Farley discussed several Democratic claims vetted by FactCheck.org over the course of the week:

Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s statement, ""Five million Americans infected by COVID-19. More than 170,000 Americans have died. By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth."" While the U.S. statistics are undeniably grim, when relative population is accounted for, the U.S. is not highest in the number of cases per 100,000 population, nor in its per capita death rate.
Biden’s claim that President Donald Trump is ""proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue."" As Farley noted, it’s tricky because Trump did say he wanted to permanently end that tax, but administration officials say the president only meant he would forgive a recently announced payroll tax deferral through the end of the year.
Former President Bill Clinton’s misleading claim that the U.S. is ""the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple"" because of Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the comparison is meaningless because the U.S. counts a temporarily laid off worker as unemployed, but many other countries do not.
And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got it wrong when she said that ""billionaires got $400 billion richer"" during the pandemic. The figure comes from a study that said the net worth of America’s billionaires grew by that much in the two months after March 18. But the economic impact of the pandemic was felt earlier. The stock market lost about 30% of its value in the prior month.

		In remarks at a Pfizer manufacturing site, President Joe Biden made misleading claims while boasting about his administration’s progress in getting Americans vaccinated against COVID-19.

Biden claimed that the Trump administration had ""failed to order enough vaccines."" It had contracts in place for plenty of vaccines for all Americans, provided other vaccines gained authorization; Biden increased the orders from the two companies with authorized vaccines.
The president claimed there was ""no real plan to vaccinate most of the country"" when he took office. There was indeed a plan to acquire and distribute vaccines. The Biden administration has done more on increasing vaccination sites and vaccinators.
Biden exaggerated when he claimed that vaccinations have ""nearly doubled"" on his watch. Even measured at its peak, the seven-day rolling average has gone up 67%.
He said Moody’s Analytics estimated that if his full COVID-19 relief plan becomes law, ""the economy will create 7 million jobs this year."" But the financial services firm said 3.5 million of those jobs would be created regardless.
Biden said without his COVID-19 relief plan, 40 million Americans would lose their benefits under the federal nutrition program. To add context, Biden’s plan would extend a 15% benefit increase enacted in December for an additional three months.

Biden spoke on Feb. 19 at Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan, manufacturing site.
Ordering Enough Vaccines
Biden claimed that the previous administration had ""failed to order enough vaccines."" But that’s misleading.
The Biden administration increased the federal government’s vaccine orders with Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. But the Trump administration had options in place to order more from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.
The Trump administration also had contracted for even more doses from other companies, but that plan depended on those vaccines getting Food and Drug Administration authorization.
""Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country,"" Biden said, going on to say his predecessor ""failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.""
We’ll start with the claim that the Trump administration hadn’t ordered ""enough vaccines."" As we’ve written before, the federal government, as of Dec. 31, had contracted to buy at least 800 million COVID-19 vaccine doses with delivery by July 31. Those doses included vaccines from four companies who have not yet received FDA authorization.
And a Government Accountability Office report, released on Jan. 28, said in a footnote that updated information from the vaccine companies and the Department of Defense ""indicate there are at least one billion vaccine doses under contract as of January 2021. Moreover, the government may acquire additional doses through the exercise of options or execution of new agreements.""
So, the Trump administration had clearly ordered ""enough"" vaccine doses for the U.S. population. However, the issue right now is that only the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are authorized. (The FDA’s vaccine advisory committee is meeting on Feb. 26 to discuss the Janssen Biotech vaccine candidate.)
In December, Pfizer and Moderna had agreed to provide 400 million doses (200 million each) by the end of July. The initial agreement with the Trump administration was for 200 million doses total from the two companies, but it made agreements for another 200 million total, according to the GAO report.
The Biden administration announced this month the two companies would provide yet another 200 million doses by the end of July, for a total of 600 million.
And Biden announced the federal government would get some of those doses sooner than previously expected, with 100 million of the doses from each company promised by the end of May, rather than the end of June.
It’s worth noting that the Trump administration could have increased its order with Pfizer and Moderna as well. The U.S. government announced its initial agreement with Pfizer in July, contracting for 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine once it was approved. That agreement included an option to acquire an additional 500 million doses from Pfizer.
Similarly, the government’s initial contract with Moderna, announced in August, was for 100 million doses of a vaccine once approved, with an option to buy another 400 million doses.
As for Biden’s claim that there was ""no real plan to vaccinate most of the country,"" the Washington Post Fact Checker wrote about a similar claim from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Fact Checker explained that there were vaccination plans that the Biden administration had built upon. But the two administrations have a philosophical difference on how much of a role the federal government, as opposed to state and local entities, should play in vaccinating the country.
On Sept. 16, nearly three months before the first FDA authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine, the Department of Health and Human Services, with support from the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released a report to Congress, outlining a strategy for vaccine distribution and a playbook for states and localities ""on how to plan and operationalize a vaccination response to COVID-19 within their respective jurisdictions,"" according to the HHS press release.
The Government Accountability Office, however, in a report released Jan. 28, said it had recommended that HHS go further to ""establish a time frame for documenting and sharing a national plan for distributing and administering COVID-19 vaccine"" including ""how efforts would be coordinated across federal agencies and nonfederal entities."" GAO said that its recommendation hadn’t been ""fully implemented.""
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Feb. 16 that there had been a vaccine distribution plan but a ""rather vague"" plan on ""getting the vaccine doses into people’s arms.""
""Getting the vaccines made, getting them shipped through Operation Warp Speed was okay,"" Fauci said. ""But I believe what the vice president is referring to is what is the process of actually getting these doses into people. That is something that we had to get much better organized now with getting the community vaccine centers, getting the pharmacies involved, getting mobile units involved.""
The Biden administration has taken steps to increase the number of people who can administer the vaccines and where the shots can be given, including by shipping vaccines directly to retail pharmacies and opening mass vaccination sites operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These steps have also come as vaccine availability has increased.
Vaccine Supply
Biden exaggerated when he claimed that vaccinations have ""nearly doubled"" on his watch.
Biden, Feb. 19: We’re now at a point where we’ve seen the average daily number of people vaccinated nearly double, from the week before I took office, to about 1.7 million average per day getting a shot.
Actually, on the day Biden spoke, the average daily number of people vaccinated had increased by 31% — not ""nearly double.""
On the day Biden took office, the seven-day ""moving average"" for the previous week was about 971,500 shots a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID Data Tracker. By Feb. 19, when Biden visited Pfizer, the daily average was at 1,270,728 vaccinations. 
The average had been higher in the days before. On Feb. 14, the seven-day moving average hit a peak of 1,621,578. That’s a 67% increase — sizable, but still not ""nearly double.""
This is not the first time that Biden has exaggerated his administration’s progress in vaccinating the public.
Earlier this month, Biden tweeted this about his promise to administer 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office: ""With the progress we’re making I believe we’ll not only reach that, we’ll break it."" But, as we wrote, the seven-day daily average was at 1 million doses per day on Biden’s second day in office — so he was well on his way to meeting his 100-day goal.
Moody’s Analytics Analysis
Biden, as he has several times before, said ""an analysis by the Wall Street firm Moody’s estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year.""
But the Jan. 15 analysis from Moody’s Analytics didn’t say Biden’s economic plan alone would be responsible for the addition of all those jobs, as the president’s statement could suggest.
Moody’s said that, assuming Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan is fully enacted by March, gross domestic product would grow to 8% for 2021 and 4% in 2022. ""At this pace of growth, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs in 2021 (December to December) and 2.5 million in 2022 to fully recover the jobs lost since the pre-pandemic peak,"" the analysis said.
The report, however, noted that projected economic growth ""is almost double the growth that would be expected without any additional fiscal support.""
The chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, Mark Zandi, who co-authored the analysis of Biden’s proposal, confirmed that means nearly half of the projected job gains for this year are likely to occur even if the president’s plan doesn’t become law.
""If there is no additional fiscal support, the economy will create 3.5 million jobs during this period [December 2020 and December 2021], or 4 million less than if the Biden plan is passed,"" Zandi told us in an email.
At least one time, Biden himself has made that distinction more clear.
""Wall Street investment firm, Moody’s, says if we pass the American Rescue Plan, it will lead to 4 million more jobs than otherwise would be created,"" he said in Feb. 5 remarks at the White House, for example.
Food Stamps
In advocating for the American Rescue Plan, the president said ""40 million Americans will lose nutritional assistance through a program we call SNAP, the old food stamp program"" if the relief plan isn’t enacted.
""Do we not invest $3 million — $3 billion to keep families from going hungry?"" he said.
That claim needs context.
The White House transcript of Biden’s remarks added the words ""some of their"" in brackets before ""nutritional assistance."" If Biden’s plan isn’t enacted, those Americans in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — 42.9 million as of September, the latest figures available — would lose ""some of"" their benefits, but not until the end of June.
COVID-19 relief legislation passed in December put in place a 15% SNAP benefit increase that will last through June; Biden’s plan would extend that 15% boost until September. In announcing the plan in January, the White House said Biden ""is also committed to providing this boost for as long as the COVID-19 crisis continues, and will work with Congress on ways to automatically adjust the length and amount of relief depending on health and economic conditions.""

		Quick Take
A meme suggesting that face masks are useless against COVID-19 has been circulating online. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a face covering in public since the virus is transmitted mostly through droplets produced when people cough, sneeze and talk.
Full Story
July brought a surge in new COVID-19 cases in the United States. The first several days included the highest daily counts yet as the country exceeded 3 million total cases, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the absence of a cure or vaccine for COVID-19, the CDC has recommended measures to slow the spread of the virus that causes it. Among those recommendations is wearing a mask or face covering when in public since the virus moves mostly through droplets produced when people cough, sneeze and talk. The mask helps to contain those droplets and protect others from infection.
But a popular meme is feeding the misconception that masks are useless against COVID-19. The meme features a picture of a box of ear-loop masks and says: ""Why are yall wearing a mask? Even the box is saying it doesn’t protect against covid19.""
It’s true that the box of masks pictured includes a warning that says: ""THIS PRODUCT IS AN EAR LOOP MASK. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A RESPIRATOR AND WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19(CORONAVIRUS) OR OTHER VIRUSES OR CONTAMINANTS.""
But presenting that warning as proof that wearing a face covering is unnecessary misconstrues the reason for wearing one and furthers the potentially harmful practice of ignoring the recommendation. As the CDC explains, ""A cloth face covering may not protect the wearer, but it may keep the wearer from spreading the virus to others.""
That’s been the advice of the CDC since April 3, when it reversed its earlier position on the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing new studies on the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.
""We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms,"" the CDC said in its announcement. ""In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.""
Later that month, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for mask manufacturers. The EUA specified that makers of non-medical masks marketed for use by the public to slow the spread of COVID-19 make clear to consumers that they are not meant to be used in a clinical setting. Likewise, they are not allowed to claim that their ""product is safe or effective for the prevention or treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.""
In an FAQ, the FDA further clarified that non-surgical face masks are authorized for ""source control,"" which means ""preventing the transmission of infection through a person’s respiratory secretions which are produced when speaking, coughing, or sneezing."" But they are ""not authorized to be personal protective equipment"" by medical personnel, ""meaning they are not a substitute for filtering face piece respirators or for surgical face masks.""
Regardless, the picture used in this meme has been circulating with suggestive claims about the efficacy of face coverings generally since at least May. Arizona state Rep. Kelly Townsend shared it in May and Tallahassee, Florida, talk radio show host Preston Scott shared it in June.
But there’s nothing remarkable about the warning on that box of masks. Similar warnings, in line with the FDA’s rules, are included on packaging from other manufacturers, too.

      Idaho Doctor Makes Baseless Claims About Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines

		SciCheck Digest
A viral video features a doctor making dubious claims about COVID-19 vaccines and treatments at a forum hosted by Idaho’s lieutenant governor. Dr. Ryan Cole claims mRNA vaccines cause cancer and autoimmune diseases, but the lead author of the paper on which Cole based that claim told us there is no evidence mRNA vaccines cause those ailments.

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How do we know vaccines are safe?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
More than 565,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., but two effective mRNA vaccines are now available. Some treatments for certain patients, such as those hospitalized or receiving oxygen, have also been approved or authorized by federal agencies, and they continue to be studied.
Since the pandemic began, however, politicized social media posts have featured doctors, some looking authoritative in white coats, spreading dubious claims about both vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. The most recent example in this misinformation niche is Dr. Ryan Cole, who owns a medical lab in Idaho.
Cole is featured in a video that has amassed more than a million views. He makes a variety of claims, some of which we’ve addressed before.
The video was recorded while he spoke at a forum on March 4 hosted by Idaho’s lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, a Republican, and it was posted by a Libertarian organization called the Idaho Freedom Foundation.
McGeachin was featured in an October post by that group, posing with a Bible and a gun in a video that advocated against public health measures related to the pandemic and asked viewers to sign a statement saying that ""any order issued in the future will be ignored.""
Cole said in an interview with FactCheck.org that he’s ""not affiliated with any political party, group or organization."" According to the Idaho Secretary of State’s office, Cole is registered as a Republican.
In the March 4 video, Cole makes claims suggesting that federal agencies have acted nefariously, as well as claims that undermine vaccines and promise miracle treatments.
We’ll address his four main claims.

Although there is no evidence to support this, Cole suggested that some of the COVID-19 vaccines could cause cancer or autoimmune diseases.
Again, without evidence, Cole suggested that the federal government withheld a treatment for COVID-19 in order to ""vend"" a vaccine.
Studies haven’t proved that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID-19, but Cole claimed that federal agencies ""have suppressed this life-saving medication.""
Cole said public health officials should encourage people to take vitamin D supplements rather than wear masks or stay physically distant from others.

Vaccine Safety
Two of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to train recipients’ immune systems to make antibodies that fight the virus that causes COVID-19. (See SciCheck’s articles on those vaccines: ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine."")
These are the first vaccines using mRNA technology authorized in the U.S., but scientists have been developing and testing mRNA vaccines for years, including in people during clinical trials. Still, misinformation exploiting fears of this new technology has been common online.
To those bogus claims, Cole has now added: ""mRNA trials in mammals have led to odd cancers. mRNA trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases — not right away, six, nine, 12 months later.""
We asked Cole to provide support for those claims, and he referred us to a 2018 paper published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery that reviewed trials and studies of various, earlier mRNA vaccines.
But that paper doesn’t support his statement.
Norbert Pardi, a research assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, was the lead author of the paper. He told us in an email, ""No publications demonstrate that mRNA vaccines cause cancer or autoimmune diseases.""
Pardi’s 19-page paper does make one passing reference to autoimmune diseases, which is what Cole highlighted to us.
The paper says: ""A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.""
But, Pardi explained, he and the other researchers included that passage because they wanted to note some potential concerns. However, he emphasized that ""no scientific evidence has confirmed that these concerns are real.""
It’s also worth noting that the paper predated the COVID-19 pandemic by two years, so it doesn’t include any information specifically about the COVID-19 vaccines.
Simply put, ""there is no scientific evidence that shows that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune diseases,"" Pardi said. ""Multiple clinical trials have been performed with mRNA vaccines in the past 10 years and none of them found that mRNA vaccination caused autoimmune diseases. Further, we are not aware of any studies showing an autoimmune disease appearing many months after vaccination as Dr. Cole inaccurately suggests.""
Likewise, Dr. Roger Shapiro, associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email that he was unaware of any study that would support Cole’s claim that the vaccines are carcinogenic.
""There is nothing in the science of mRNA vaccines that would suggest carcinogenicity, and they have been tested in humans for other diseases before COVID-19,"" Shapiro said. ""mRNA rapidly breaks down in the body, and probably does not last long enough to act as a carcinogen.""
""Regarding autoimmunity,"" he said, ""this is always a concern with any medical product, but there is no evidence to date suggesting it, and it does not seem any more likely than with other vaccines. mRNA is made all the time in our bodies, and delivering it by vaccine should not be different.""
Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, concurred with the other experts with whom we spoke. In a phone interview, he characterized Cole’s claims about cancer as ""fearmongering"" and said, ""There’s just no scientific basis for that.""
""We’re talking about these very small fragments of messenger RNA that don’t hang around for long at all,"" he said, noting that the mRNA vaccines have been in use for almost six months and have been ""very safe, very well-tolerated vaccines.""
Winslow recognized that some people are concerned that the mRNA from the vaccine might persist in their bodies and somehow change their genetics or cause long-term effects. So he emphasized that the vaccines have small fragments of RNA, which survive only briefly and carry information about the virus that causes COVID-19.
Similarly, Pardi told us, ""COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not alter our DNA and they get rapidly degraded so they do not promote cancer formation.""
Treatments, Vaccines Can Both Be Approved
Cole also suggested in the video that the federal government had suppressed a treatment for COVID-19 in order to ""vend"" a vaccine. (We’ll address his claims about the supposed treatment in the next section.)
""If there’s a treatment for a disease, the federal government cannot approve a vaccine by law, by rule,"" Cole falsely claimed, suggesting that federal agencies were withholding access to a treatment for COVID-19 so that they could instead profit from vaccines.
""So, the NIH, who, you know, is involved in approving medications, they co-hold the patent on the ‘vaccine’ with Moderna,"" Cole said, referring to the National Institutes of Health, an agency that does not approve medications. ""If the fox is not guarding the henhouse there, I don’t know who is. That also is insanity to have the government in bed with a private company vending a product that they want to give to everybody.""
There are several problems with this statement.
First, there is no law barring vaccines if treatments are available for a given disease, said Jorge Contreras, a professor in the College of Law at the University of Utah who specializes in intellectual property and genetics and the law. He asked, ""Why would there be such a law?""
Clearly there isn’t, Contreras pointed out, since the Food and Drug Administration authorizes a flu vaccine every year while Tamiflu, an antiviral drug used to treat the flu, has been available since the FDA approved it in 1999.
""It’s certainly true that many diseases that we vaccinate for, there is no known cure for,"" he said, noting that this is often the case with viral diseases, which are hard to treat.
""But that’s not a legal requirement. That’s a scientific reality,"" he said.
As for Cole’s claim about the NIH, that agency conducts and funds research. It doesn’t approve drugs, medical devices or vaccines — that’s a function of the FDA.
The NIH did collaborate with Moderna on the development of its COVID-19 vaccine. As we’ve explained, government researchers had previously been working with scientists at Moderna on an investigational vaccine to protect against MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus. The team was able to apply that knowledge to design a COVID-19 vaccine.
Since the NIH does research, it also files and receives patents, many of which it licenses to pharmaceutical companies. So, Contreras said, NIH’s patents stemming from research on mRNA vaccines are to be expected, and use of those patents by pharmaceutical companies is also to be expected. Similarly, scientists from government-funded labs sometimes share credit on patents with scientists from privately funded labs. That’s normal, too, Contreras said.
Generally, he explained, there are two reasons that the NIH licenses its patents to companies. First, the NIH is a taxpayer-funded institution, and it can recoup some of its investment in research by lending out the use of its discoveries. Second, the clinical trials required to bring a drug or vaccine to market are risky and expensive, so, theoretically, making its discoveries available to companies can encourage the private sector to take the risk and create products.
So, Cole mischaracterizes the relationship between the NIH and the vaccine manufacturers when he says that it’s a ""conflict of interest"" to have the ""federal government in bed with a vaccine company.""
It’s actually normal to have pharmaceutical companies use government-owned patents.
And he’s wrong when he says of federal agencies, ""they don’t want a therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine.""
There’s nothing that would prohibit the use of vaccines if there were an effective treatment for COVID-19.
Not Enough Data on Ivermectin
Neither the World Health Organization nor the National Institutes of Health has recommended the use of ivermectin — a common anti-parasitic medication — in the treatment of COVID-19.
Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin, has similarly noted that there is ""[n]o scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.""
But Cole claimed in the video that ivermectin is a ""treatment"" for COVID-19.
He suggested that federal agencies have stifled its use so that they could profit from vaccines, as we explained above.
""We’re in farm country, horse country — you know, you give it to your dogs, your cats, your horses,"" Cole said in the video, addressing an audience in Idaho.
Ivermectin is used to treat parasites in animals, but crossover use in humans can be dangerous. While Cole may have only been emphasizing the ubiquity of the drug, not suggesting that people should take veterinary medicine, the FDA has said that patients have been hospitalized after taking ivermectin intended for horses as interest in the drug as treatment for COVID-19 has grown.
Ivermectin does have antiviral properties, but the FDA hasn’t approved it to treat any viral infections. It is being studied with regard to COVID-19, though, according to both the WHO and NIH.
""Treating COVID-19 with Ivermectin is still being evaluated in clinical trials, but at present there is not enough evidence to support its use,"" said Shapiro, the Harvard professor. ""My understanding is that the inhibitory dose needed for it to work is extremely high and trying to take enough to suppress the virus could lead to other problems.""
The trials so far have ""showed no benefit or worsening disease, some showed shorter time to disease resolution or viral clearance, and some did show a possible mortality benefit; but there were problems with most of these trials that include small sample size and different outcome measures and other possible biases,"" he said.
Winslow, from Stanford, cautioned that ""there have been many claims for miracle cures"" over the course of the pandemic and said that ivermectin would need more rigorous study before we know how useful it would be in treating COVID-19.
""Ivermectin truly is a wonder drug for parasitic diseases,"" he said, ""but my suspicion is that it will be a lot like hydroxychloroquine.""
Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was touted by former President Donald Trump as a treatment for COVID-19, although studies found that it wasn’t an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects in some patients, as we’ve explained before.
The problem with drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are promoted as having broad-spectrum antiviral properties, is that the quantity of inhibitor required to effectively kill off the virus also sickens the host cells, Winslow said.
Even potent versions, like remdesivir, which Winslow referred to as the ""gold standard"" of specific antiviral therapy in COVID-19 treatments, only accelerates the time to recovery, but doesn’t significantly reduce death rates or mortality from COVID-19. Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19; the approval is for patients requiring hospitalization.
So, Cole’s claim that ""there is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in Washington who have suppressed this life-saving medication,"" is unfounded. Ivermectin hasn’t been proved to be effective.
Overstating Effect of Vitamin D
Another of the major points that Cole emphasized in the video is the role vitamin D could have in fighting COVID-19.
""If you do not supplement with vitamin D in the wintertime, you are immune suppressed. Most insurance companies in Idaho and northern states do not pay for a vitamin D test, unfortunately,"" said Cole, whose lab offers several vitamin D tests.
After eschewing public health guidelines that recommend staying six feet apart and wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, Cole said, ""What should public health message number one, two, and three be? Vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D.""
It’s true that vitamin D, which is mostly associated with bone health, plays a part in the immune system. But that doesn’t mean it’s a panacea for COVID-19, as we’ve explained before.
While a lot of basic research points to vitamin D having a role in the immune system, it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice and to what degree they would benefit COVID-19 patients, as we’ve written. Studies assessing whether vitamin D can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally been inconsistent.
A recent article from NPR looked at the research on vitamin D with respect to COVID-19 over the last year and found, essentially, the same thing. It also noted that some studies have shown that low vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or with becoming seriously ill.
""While these studies raised hopes among some researchers, others are skeptical, noting that most of these are observational studies, not the gold-standard randomized, controlled trials,"" the story said.
""Much of the available evidence only shows association — not causation — and even those results are mixed,"" Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told NPR.
In September, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an Instagram Live interview that for those who are deficient in vitamin D, ""I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements."" But, as we wrote before, excessive doses should not be used.

		SciCheck Digest
All of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease. Yet Fox News host Tucker Carlson baselessly casts doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines, because federal officials urge fully vaccinated people to wear masks in public settings. 

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              If I get vaccinated, can I return to my normal activities without precautions?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              If I get vaccinated, can I return to my normal activities without precautions?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              Not entirely, at least not yet. In guidance for the fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people ""no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance,"" except in health care settings, correctional facilities and homeless shelters. The CDC also noted that its guidance does not apply in settings where masks and social distancing are ""required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance."" The CDC also continues to require face masks ""on all planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation.""
The CDC said that ""a growing body of evidence suggests that fully vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection and potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others."" Research on the extent of vaccine protection is ongoing. No vaccine is 100% effective.

              How effective are the vaccines?

              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

Full Story
All of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease. 
In phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are fully vaccinated. In real-world conditions, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in March found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective in preventing infections — not just symptomatic cases.
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial reported an efficacy of 72% in preventing moderate to severe disease in the U.S. and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease.
The CDC, however, recommends that for now fully vaccinated people should wear masks in public for several reasons, including a stubbornly high rate of infection, concern about variants and the need for more research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make unvaccinated people sick.
Notwithstanding the data, Fox News host Tucker Carlson baselessly casts doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines by claiming ""people in charge are acting like it doesn’t work,"" citing the fact that President Joe Biden wears a mask even though he has been vaccinated.
Carlson made his remarks April 14 on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" A four-minute segment from that show — which included a chyron that said ""Fauci Should Be Able to Answer Simple Questions"" — was posted to the ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Facebook page.
Carlson, April 14: Why, for example, does Tony Fauci say you have to wear a mask after you get the vaccine? If we’re following the science, and we sincerely hope to, we’re wondering, is Fauci telling Americans who have been vaccinated or who have been recovered from the coronavirus itself, that they aren’t protected against future infections? Is that why he is saying they can’t eat in restaurants or go to bars? These are not trick questions. They’re the most basic of all questions.
Carlson repeated several versions of the same question over and over, even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has answered this ""most basic of all questions.""
As we have written, it is important not to confuse the virus, SARS-CoV-2, with the disease that it causes, COVID-19. The vaccines protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus. It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccinated person may not experience symptoms. 
Fauci explained this in a Dec. 10 interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo before the arrival in the U.S. of the first case a SARS-CoV-2 variant. He did so again more recently at a White House briefing on April 12 and at a House oversight committee hearing on April 15.
At the hearing, Fauci said vaccinated people are not expected to show any symptoms and science needs to conduct more research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make other unvaccinated people sick.
Fauci, April 15: The vaccine trials that were done that showed the high degree 94%, 95% efficacy, the primary endpoint of the vaccine efficacy was to prevent clinically relevant disease, clinically recognizable disease. What we don’t know right now, but we will know as we gather more information, that you can get infected even though you have been vaccinated and because you are vaccinated have no symptoms and therefore you could have virus in your nasopharynx and you could then transmit it inadvertently to somebody else. You are vaccinated, you are protected, you are not getting sick.
So the wearing of the mask is predominantly, predominantly to prevent you inadvertently infecting someone else even though you are protected from disease by the vaccine. As we learn more and more, which we will, and the evidence gets better and better that a vaccinated person has a much lesser chance of getting infected asymptomatically and even if they do, the virus is very likely very low in the nasopharynx. When those data become clear, the CDC being a science-based organization, will use that scientific data to say, ""Now a vaccinated person can actually walk around without a mask.""
Fauci said there is another issue to be concerned about and that is the circulation of coronavirus variants — the first of which was discovered in the U.S. on Jan. 25 in a traveler returning to Minnesota from Brazil.
""We want to make sure that if you have full protection against one type of a virus that a variant might come along that might escape the protection. So if you want full protection and you are out in the community where there’s a lot of virus out there, that’s why we still recommend wearing a mask,"" he said. ""And in answer to question before, when you get the level of virus really low, all of that is going to go away and you are not going to have any–very, very little risk therefore people will not have to wear a mask.""
This is why both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris wear masks even though they’ve been vaccinated.
As Biden explained in a Dec. 3 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, they’re setting an example for the public. ""It is important that we, in fact, the president and the vice president, we set the pattern by wearing masks,"" Biden said.
Also before he took office, Biden announced his plan for a ""100-day challenge"" aimed at slowing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. It included an appeal for all Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his administration as well as administering 100 million shots in the same timeframe.
Two weeks ahead of that deadline, more than 200 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S., about 190 million of which were given since Biden took office.
As for the call to wear masks, the first executive order that Biden signed required those on federal property to wear masks. On his second day in office, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks on public transportation.
We’re still in Biden’s first 100 days, which ends on April 30.
In guidance issued on April 2, the CDC said fully vaccinated people can meet indoors without masks or social distancing with other fully vaccinated people and can have such visits with unvaccinated people who are at low-risk of contracting severe COVID-19 (if the unvaccinated people are from a single household). But the fully vaccinated should wear masks and remain physically distanced from when visiting unvaccinated people from more than one household or in public settings. 
""When you are in the home — you are vaccinated people — or you have a child, and a grandmother, grandfather, whoever it is — as long as they’re in good shape, you don’t have to wear a mask,"" Fauci said at the April 12 White House briefing. ""But once you go out into that big bad world out there, where there are a lot of infections going on — 80,000 new infections in one day — that there is an issue there that you’ve got to be careful with.""
At the hearing, Fauci directly responded to Carlson’s false implication that vaccines don’t work. ""The implication was since you’re asking us to wear masks, the vaccine might not be working,"" he said. ""My comment to that is that the vaccines were shown, the mRNA vaccines, to be between 94 and 95 percent effective. So my answer to him is merely one of data. Look at the data. The vaccines are highly efficacious and have been shown in the field to be highly effective.""

		We could find no evidence to support President Donald Trump’s claim that Italy was ""hit hard"" by the coronavirus pandemic because ""a lot of the people that didn’t come in here went to Italy"" when the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on China.
In fact, Italy cut off air travel to and from China two days before the U.S. enacted its travel restrictions.
Trump’s claim came at the end of his daily coronavirus press conference on April 19, when he was asked about countries that did not respond appropriately and were subsequently hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump, April 19: When I closed up our border, when I did the ban on China, they say a lot of the people that didn’t come in here went to Italy. You’ve heard that. That’s why Italy was hit so hard.
I don’t think it was because of government. I will say Italy is locked down probably more than any other country right now. It’s just absolutely locked solid down. But they got hit very hard because people that were coming to the United States couldn’t come, because I closed the country in January, and they went to Italy. They say it had to do with trade. It had to do with the purchase of certain materials, and Italy was another alternative. And so many, many people went to Italy instead of coming here. And Italy has suffered greatly.
It is a perplexing claim because, as we have reported before, Italy stopped all flights to and from China on Jan. 31. Although the White House announced its travel restrictions on China the same day, they did not go into effect until Feb. 2.
Trump was wrong to say he ""closed the country in January."" As we have written, the policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. There were exceptions to that halt on travel, including for Americans and their family members.
According to a New York Times report on April 4, nearly 40,000 people had arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China since Trump imposed his travel restrictions. Moreover, the Times found, ""screening procedures have been uneven"" for those arriving on flights from China.
By contrast, Italy’s policy banned all flights between the countries, and unlike the U.S. policy, it did not carve out exceptions for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
We reached out to the White House for clarification or evidence to back up the president’s claim, but we got no response.
""I honestly cannot make heads or tails of what the President is claiming here,"" Ron Klain, who served as the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator, told us via email. Klain once served as former Vice President Joe Biden’s chief of staff and is now an adviser to the Biden campaign. ""It really makes no sense at all. The facts are, as you know, that Italy did restrict travel from China before the U.S. did, so his first assertion is based on a lie. And the second thing is, if people really were going to Italy in late Jan/Feb, why did the President wait until March … to impose a limit on travel from Italy to the U.S.?""
Italy was hit early and particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic. In mid-March, Italy had the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths outside China, and far more than any other country in Europe (and vastly higher than the number of cases and deaths in the U.S. at that time). Since then, the U.S. has far surpassed the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Italy, though the number of per capita deaths in Italy remains among the highest in the world — and higher than in the U.S.
But the timeline of reported cases and responses by Italy and the U.S. does not support Trump’s claim that Italy ""got hit very hard because people that were coming to the United States couldn’t come, because I closed the country in January, and they went to Italy.""
The first two cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, were disclosed on Jan. 30, when the government reported that two Chinese tourists who had arrived in Milan on Jan. 23 had been hospitalized. A day later, Italy immediately banned all air travel between Italy and China, without exceptions. (By contrast, Trump announced his travel restrictions on China 10 days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first travel-related case of COVID-19 in the U.S.) A cluster of cases emerged in early March in northern Italy, triggering tight quarantine restrictions in 15 northern and central provinces. The restrictions were quickly expanded nationwide.
It is possible that people came into Italy from China via indirect routes, but it seems unlikely that would have included Chinese tourists barred from entering the U.S. As the Washington Post noted, China canceled all domestic and international tour groups on Jan. 26, although those already underway were permitted to continue to their completion. That predates the U.S. travel restrictions.
Trump said, ""They say it had to do with trade. It had to do with the purchase of certain materials, and Italy was another alternative."" But the U.S. travel restrictions did not impact cargo shipments between the countries (either by air or sea), according to a Department of Homeland Security fact sheet on the travel restrictions.
We couldn’t find any news reports about U.S. travel restrictions on China contributing to an influx of people to Italy, and worsening its coronavirus situation. Rather, experts have cited a number of reasons why the coronavirus resulted in an explosion of deaths in Italy, including the country’s relatively aged population, the density of the population, ineffective public health intervention in some areas of the country, and a shortage of intensive care hospital beds.
In an article published in the Journal of Global Health, Igor Rudan, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, wrote that ""it is possible that Chinese tourists from Wuhan were visiting Northern Italy in January and February 2020"" and that infected tourists who were asymptomatic were allowed to enter the country even with proper checks.
Rudan also noted that ""[s]ome investigative journalists hypothesized, although this has not been confirmed, that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of Chinese workers to northern Italy [mainly for work in the textile and fashion industries] may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus. … Whether through Chinese tourists, textile workers, or through some other route, the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the Italian ‘first line of defence’ which remained unrecognized in the first few weeks.""
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is currently in Italy with his wife, backed that theory, telling Fox News that the direct flights between Wuhan and Milan may have triggered the coronavirus outbreak in Italy.
""None of us, at least I didn’t know that there were 100,000 Chinese [people] living in northern Italy and that many of them come from Wuhan and that there was a flight between Milan and Wuhan,"" Gingrich said. ""We think that’s how the virus got Italy early. Initially, the government didn’t realize how dangerous it was going to be. It dealt with it initially as sort of a small town, local regional problem, and then boom, it exploded.""
Even if that were the case, that mass migration from China to Italy predated the U.S. travel restrictions. And it is unclear why or how, as Trump alleged, ""many, many people went to Italy instead of coming here"" after the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on China. As we explained, Italy had already banned all flights from China before the U.S. implemented restrictions. We will update this story if further information emerges.

		During a campaign rally, President Donald Trump said that once he came down with COVID-19, people for partisan reasons shifted from saying immunity was lifelong to saying it lasted only a few months. Experts, however, haven’t changed their estimates for immunity duration, which remains unknown — but unlikely to be lifelong.
The president also has repeatedly declared himself ""immune"" to COVID-19 following his illness. That’s a reasonable assumption — at least for now — but whether he’s actually resistant to a second infection isn’t known. And his unique treatment regimen could mean his potential immunity is more fleeting than that of most other people who have recovered from the coronavirus.
Trump first alleged that COVID-19 immunity estimates changed in an Oct. 13 rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after asking the crowd who else had caught the coronavirus.
Trump, Oct. 13: Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who’s had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you’re the people I want to say hello to because you’re right now immune. You’re right now immune. Or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, ""Well, if you have it, you’re immune for life,"" right? Once I got it, they give you four months. … It’s anybody else but me, you’re immune for life.
In subsequent news interviews, the president repeated the claim.
""All I know is I got better very quickly, and I feel very good. I mean, really good. Totally negative, and, uh, you know, I guess you have immunity for a certain period of time, too,"" Trump told Newsmax’s Greg Kelly in an Oct. 14 phone interview. ""Uh, it used to be for life, until I got it. Now, when I get it, they say it’s only four months, you know. In other words, it was somebody else’s that was for life, but, uh, but I have immunity, I guess.""
Trump stuck with that story the next day, in an interview with Fox Business’ Stuart Varney. 
""And we’re going to have — there’s — like I have immunity now, and I don’t know, they — I hear from anywhere from four months to a lifetime,"" he said. ""It’s sort of interesting, as soon as I beat it they said, no, he’s only immune for four months. I said, well, I always heard for a lifetime, but that’s OK, you know. If it was anybody else — hey, Stuart, if it was you, they’d say, yes, he’s immune for his lifetime. But with me, they say four months. You know, they want to make it look as bad as possible.""
It’s not clear who ""they"" are when Trump is speaking, but scientists don’t know with any certainty how long any possible immunity to the coronavirus lasts because the virus, SARS-CoV-2, is so new. 
""There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again; this is called natural immunity,"" explains a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage updated on Oct. 14. ""Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this.""
Even from the beginning, experts did not expect immunity to be lifelong. As we explained back in April, based on what is known about other human coronaviruses, immunity to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to last only a few years at most.
""Reasonable guesses are that on the short end there might be partial protection for about a year or close to a year. And on the long end it might be longer — it might be several years of good protection,"" said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist and director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, in a call with reporters earlier this spring.
A standard proxy for immunity is the presence of Y-shaped immune proteins known as antibodies, especially so-called neutralizing antibodies that can glom on and clear invading viral particles even before the virus can enter cells. 
Lab tests, for example, can evaluate whether antibodies demonstrate neutralizing activity in a test tube. But as we’ve explained before, those tests aren’t routinely done — and even if they are, there’s still no guarantee that those antibodies will be functional and prevent an infection. That’s why scientists remain cautious about saying someone with antibodies is even temporarily immune — even though it’s likely.
So far, data suggest that most people generate antibodies in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that those molecules persist for at least a few months, although some studies have reported more limited durations. 
An unpublished study in New York City, for example, found that 95% or more of people with confirmed coronavirus infections developed antibodies — and that neutralizing antibodies stuck around for at least three months. Similarly, a study in Iceland found that 91% of recovered COVID-19 patients developed detectable antibodies, with levels remaining steady for four months.
How much longer the antibodies might last is unknown, and only time will tell. 
Antibodies aren’t the only consideration for immunity, as we’ve noted before. Other immune cells known as T cells also contribute, so even if someone doesn’t have antibodies anymore, they could have some degree of protection. And the B cells that make antibodies also typically stick around, ready to pump out antibodies more quickly if they encounter the pathogen again. Initial data indicate that these cells are also present for at least three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
While the evidence suggests that most people who have come down with COVID-19 will be protected against contracting the virus again for at least several months, there are several case reports of individuals becoming reinfected.
Immunologists do not think this phenomenon is common, as there are fewer than five confirmed reports out of nearly 40 million infections worldwide. But it does show that individual responses to the virus can vary — and that even temporary immunity is not a given.
Trump’s Unique Situation
Because there is no way to know for certain whether a person is immune — short of trying to purposely reinfect someone — it’s impossible to know whether Trump is right when he says he has immunity.
The president has claimed to be immune on multiple occasions following his Oct. 5 release from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he stayed for three nights to treat COVID-19.
In an Oct. 11 tweet, which Twitter flagged for spreading misinformation, Trump claimed to have received a ""total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday,"" adding, ""That means I can’t get it (immune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!!""
At his Johnstown rally two days later, Trump said, ""And now I’m immune, they tell me I’m immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I’ll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman.""
Trump very likely is protected for now, but the fact that he received Regeneron’s experimental antibody cocktail as a treatment for his disease could mean that in the future, he could become susceptible again more quickly than most other COVID-19 patients.
As the New York Times reported, it’s possible that the antibody infusion prevented him from mounting his own antibody response — and that when the synthetic proteins clear from his body, he may be no longer protected.
Trump also received the steroid dexamethasone, which might also mute the body’s natural immune response.
According to information released by the White House, Trump probably did not start to make antibodies on his own prior to the Regeneron infusion. An Oct. 7 memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, the president’s physician, states that the president had ""detectable levels"" of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on Oct. 5, but not on the night of Oct. 1. Trump received the Regeneron antibodies the following day.
Regeneron told us in an email that antibody levels remain high one month after infusion — so protection would be expected to last at least that long — but declined to speculate further. 
A company document shows that at the 8 gram dosage the president took, it takes 18 days for one of the antibodies in the cocktail to decline by half, and 25 days for the second antibody, which suggests the drug could be given once a month. More data on the length of protection, a spokesperson said, would be forthcoming in the ongoing clinical trials.
We cannot know if Trump’s natural immune response was hampered by the drugs he took or not. But regardless of his immune status, the same public health recommendations still apply.
The CDC recommends that all people, ""whether or not they have had COVID-19, take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19,"" including washing hands, practicing physical distancing and wearing a mask.

      Trump, Biden Spin China Travel Restrictions

		Both President Donald Trump and leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are spinning the facts on the administration’s coronavirus travel restrictions for those who had been in China.
Trump has repeatedly boasted, as he did on April 4, that ""I stopped people from China very early — very, very early — from coming into our country."" On April 1, Trump said that ""banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people"" was one of the actions his administration took that was ""far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else.""
On ABC’s ""This Week"" on April 5, Biden said ""45 nations had already moved"" to restrict travel from China ""before the president moved."" Said Biden, ""We started off awfully slow.""
The U.S. did not act ""way ahead of anybody else"" in imposing travel restrictions from China, as Trump alleges, nor was it late getting into the act compared with other countries around the world, as Biden says.
ThinkGlobalHealth, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, has been tracking the travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19. Its country-by-country analysis of the date and type of travel restrictions shows that in the days after the World Health Organization on Jan. 30 declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, 36 countries imposed travel restrictions, including the U.S., by Feb. 2.
""What this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,"" a co-author of the tracker, Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us via email.
Dueling Narratives
A day after the WHO decision, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the U.S. for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.
As we have written, Trump was wrong to call the policy a ""travel ban"" or to claim that he ""closed up"" all travel between the countries. There were exceptions, including for Americans and their family members and for trade. Trump also has repeatedly and misleadingly cast his decision to impose the travel restrictions as a ""bold"" move made ""against the advice of almost everybody."" Azar said the decision stemmed from ""the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.""
Trump has repeatedly claimed that his decision to impose the travel restrictions on China ""had Biden calling me xenophobic"" and ""racist.""
On the day the White House announced the travel restrictions, Biden did say at a campaign event in Iowa that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans ""need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it."" He added, ""This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.""
The Biden campaign says Biden’s ""reference to xenophobia was about Trump’s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China,"" and that he was not talking about the travel ban.
On April 3, Biden’s campaign said Biden supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.
""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.""
In a coronavirus task force press briefing on April 4, Trump asked if people had seen the ""breaking news"" that Biden ""agreed that [Trump] was correct when I stopped people from China very early — very, very early — from coming into our country.""
On ABC’s ""This Week"" on April 5, Biden responded that while he agreed with the travel restrictions on China, he didn’t think the president acted with enough ""urgency.""
Biden, April 5: You got to go faster than slower. And we started off awfully slow. He indicated that I complimented him on — on dealing with China. Well, you know, 45 nations had already moved to keep — block China’s personnel from being able to come to the United States before the president moved. So, it’s just — it’s about pace. It’s about — it’s about the urgency. And I don’t think there’s been enough of it, urgency.
According to Kiernan, co-creator of the ThinkGlobalHealth tracker on travel restrictions on China, 46 countries and territories (Macau and Hong Kong) imposed travel restrictions on China that came into effect before the United States’ restrictions did. (Although the U.S. announced its travel restrictions on Jan. 31, they did not go into effect until Feb. 2.) Twelve other countries’ travel restrictions against China came into effect on Feb. 2, the same day as the U.S.
Most of those countries’ decisions came in the days immediately after the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, Kiernan said.
""To be fair, the United States was one of the first Western countries to impose any kind of formal travel restriction against China,"" Kiernan told us. ""With the exceptions of the Czech Republic (suspended visas seven days after U.S. implemented restrictions) and Italy (suspended flights two days before U.S. implemented restrictions), the EU did not impose travel restrictions against China specifically. Australia imposed its entry ban on travelers from China, which was quite similar to the United States’, one day before the United States acted. New Zealand and Israel imposed their travel bans on the same day as the United States.""
In general, she said, the earliest countries to impose travel restrictions against China were Asian and Pacific countries.
""The Marshall Islands, for instance, imposed the earliest travel ban against China on January 24,"" Kiernan said. ""North Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Macau, Kazakhstan, Micronesia, Laos, Malaysia, etc. all imposed some form of travel restriction against China in January as well. A few African nations imposed travel restrictions against China in January as well, such as Mauritius and Seychelles.""
""Taking this all together, what this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,"" Kiernan said.
The United States announced its restrictions the day after the WHO declared a public health emergency, ""and those restrictions came into effect two days later. However, to say the United States was one of the first countries to impose an entry ban on travelers from China would be incorrect,"" she said. ""By my count, roughly twenty countries and territories (Hong Kong) imposed entry bans similar if not more stringent than the U.S. ban prior to the United States imposing its restrictions.""
That contradicts the narratives of both Trump and Biden.
Correction, May 4: We originally misspelled Kate Bedingfield’s last name. We regret the error.

		Summary
As the socially distanced convention came to a close, Joe Biden accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination with a speech that was largely accurate, but lacked context in some instances:

Biden claimed that America has ""by far the worst performance of any nation"" with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. While that’s true based on the raw totals of COVID-19 cases and deaths, the U.S. is not the worst when adjusted for population or on other metrics.
The former vice president referred to the tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump as ""the president’s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations."" Although those with higher incomes reaped greater benefits from the tax law, most households received a tax cut.
Biden said Trump was ""proposing to eliminate"" the payroll tax that funds Social Security. The president did say he would be ""ending that tax,"" but administration officials said he meant he would forgive a recently announced payroll tax deferral.
Biden said, ""More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year."" A study did find that, but it also said most would regain insurance from another source, leaving 3.5 million of them uninsured.
Earlier in the night, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said ""Trump has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs."" True, but that’s because of the pandemic. And not mentioned is that 192,000 were lost during the Obama-Biden years.

The Democrats wrapped up their four-day convention on Aug. 20. The Republican National Convention kicks off on Aug. 24.
Analysis
‘Worst Performance’ With COVID-19
In critiquing Trump on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Biden pointed to the U.S.’s high COVID-19 caseload and death toll.
""Just judge this president on the facts,"" he said. ""Five million Americans infected by COVID-19. More than 170,000 Americans have died. By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth.""
Biden is right that in both coronavirus cases and deaths, the U.S. has the most of any other country. As of Aug. 21, America’s totals stand at 5.6 million cases and more than 174,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 dashboard. The next-worst nation is Brazil, with 3.5 million cases and around 112,000 deaths.
But by other metrics, the U.S. does not have the worst record. When population is factored in, seven other countries, per Oxford University’s Our World in Data for Aug. 20, have more cumulative COVID-19 cases. This includes Qatar, with more than 40,000 cases per million people, and Bahrain, San Marino, Chile, Panama, Kuwait and Peru. The U.S. places eighth, with 16,706 cases per million.
On deaths per capita, the U.S. also does not fare the worst. Our World in Data shows America with the 10th-highest death rate, better than San Marino, Belgium, Peru, Andorra, Spain, the U.K., Italy, Sweden and Chile. In a similar dataset from Johns Hopkins, the U.S. does better than an additional country, Brazil.
Although harder to interpret and heavily influenced by the number of coronavirus tests performed, the U.S. also does substantially better on its observed case-fatality rate, or the proportion of people identified with the virus who have died. In the U.S., 3.1% of those known to be infected with the virus have died — a lower rate than 55 other countries in the Johns Hopkins analysis.
While the COVID-19 statistics for the U.S. are certainly grim — and America is by no means leading the world with its superior COVID-19 ""performance"" — by a variety of metrics, it is not the worst.
GOP Tax Cuts
Biden referred to the tax cuts championed by Trump as ""the president’s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which do not pay any tax at all."" Although those with higher incomes reaped greater benefits from the tax law, most households received a tax cut.
Biden’s dig at the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — a Republican-crafted bill that the president signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017 — came as Biden highlighted a list of priorities. such as investing in infrastructure, education, child care and addressing climate change. Those are all things Biden has promised during the campaign that he could pay for, in part, by rolling back the Trump tax cuts on households making above the $400,000 threshold and raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.
Biden, Aug. 20: And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes, unnecessary loopholes, and the president’s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of do not pay any tax at all.
The line hearkened back to one Biden used in his campaign kickoff speech on April 29, 2019, when he claimed that ""all of"" the tax cuts signed into law by Trump ""went to folks at the top and corporations that pay no taxes.""


As we wrote then, the law provided tax cuts to those at all income levels, on average. The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 65% of households paid less in federal income tax in 2018 under the tax law than they would have paid under the old tax laws, while about 6% paid more.
A higher percentage of high-income taxpayers got a tax cut, and that tax cut was, on average, greater than the tax cuts for those with lower incomes (both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of after-tax income). But 82% of middle-income earners — those with income between about $49,000 and $86,000 — received a tax cut that averaged about $1,050 in 2018, the Tax Policy Center estimated.
Most of the individual income tax provisions expire after 2025, which will then shift most of the tax benefits to the top 1%. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the top 1% of income earners would get 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018. That percentage would go up to 25.3% in 2025 and then jump to 82.8% in 2027.
At the time it was passed, the tax law was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to cost $1.46 trillion over 10 years through 2027. The Tax Policy Center noted that looking at a revised 10-year window — through 2028 – the Congressional Budget Office later revised its projection, estimating the tax cuts would increase the primary deficit by $1.8 trillion. Taking into account some of the economic growth effects — what economists call dynamic estimates — the CBO projected the law would raise primary deficits by $1.3 trillion through 2028.
Social Security
Biden took aim at Trump by arguing that ""for our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made"" and that ""the current president is threatening to break that promise.""
""He’s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue, resulting in cuts,"" Biden said.
Trump, for his part, has argued that ""Social Security will be totally protected under me.""
Biden’s comments refer to statements made by Trump this month suggesting that he wants to permanently eliminate the payroll tax that funds Social Security. Trump administration officials, on the other hand, have said that the president was referring to the permanent forgiveness of a recently announced payroll tax deferral.
We’ll explain here.
On Aug. 8, Trump issued a memorandum to defer some employees’ portion of the payroll tax through the end of the year. Social Security is primarily funded by that tax (including employers’ portions): In 2019, the tax brought in $944.5 billion to cover Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance, or nearly 90% of its cost, according to the Social Security Administration.
Trump’s memo also instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to ""explore avenues, including legislation, to eliminate the obligation to pay the taxes deferred pursuant to the implementation of this memorandum."" In other words, the administration is looking for ways to potentially forgive that deferred amount — which could be upward of $100 billion, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
But Trump also indicated that he wanted to either cut or eliminate the payroll tax, permanently.
In remarks on Aug. 8, Trump said: ""If I’m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I’m going to make them all permanent.""
Two days later, he said: ""I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday, with the understanding that after the election — on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that’s done a great job — we will be ending that tax. We’ll be terminating that tax.""
Administration officials, however, said he was actually referring to forgiving the payroll taxes deferred this year.
""When he referred to permanent, I think what he was saying is that the deferral of the payroll tax to the end of the year will be made permanent. It will be forgiven. The tax is not going away,"" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNN on Aug. 9.
And on Aug. 13, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters: ""What he was meaning yesterday is that he wants permanent forgiveness of the deferral.""
It’s unclear how exactly the hole left by the defacto tax cut would be covered. There are two options: The money would come out of Social Security’s trust funds, or from general revenues (which would need to be approved by Congress). The trust funds are estimated to be depleted by 2035.
The Bipartisan Policy Center’s William Hoagland told PolitiFact that if the payroll tax deferral costs $80 billion and came from the trust funds, it ""would not gut the program,"" but would ""only impact the date of depletion, possibly a year or two earlier than expected.""
Biden would have a point about Trump ""threatening"" Social Security if the president indeed plans on ""terminating"" a tax that funds the program. But it’s not clear what Trump would do, and his aides say he was referring only to making a short-term tax deferral permanent — which has less of an impact on Social Security’s finances.
Health Insurance
Biden went through some of the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, saying, ""More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year."" That figure comes from an Urban Institute study, though it’s worth noting the study said most of those 10 million would regain insurance from another source.
The Urban Institute estimated the impact from job losses on those with employer-sponsored health insurance, finding that over the April-to-December time frame, 10.1 million people would lose employer-sponsored coverage. But many would switch to insurance through another family member, Medicaid or the individual market, leaving 3.5 million uninsured in the end.
Urban Institute, July 13, 2020: We find that 48 million people will live in families with a worker who experiences a COVID-19-related job loss in the last three quarters of 2020. Of them, 10.1 million lose employer coverage tied to that job. We estimate 32 percent of these people switch to another source of employer coverage through a family member, 28 percent enroll in Medicaid, and 6 percent enroll in the nongroup market, mainly in marketplace coverage with premium tax credits. Still, we estimate 3.5 million people in this group become uninsured.
The study further said that those changes would be ""offset somewhat by coverage transitions,"" namely about 500,000 people who were uninsured before the economic impacts of the coronavirus would become eligible for Medicaid and sign up for it. That would result in a net 2.9 million uninsured.
Other estimates give higher figures for the uninsured. Families USA, which advocates for ""health care consumers,"" estimated that 5.4 million laid-off workers had lost health insurance between February and May, adding that the estimate didn’t include family members of those workers who also would have lost coverage.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 26.8 million could lose employer insurance as of May 2. The vast majority of those — 79% — would be eligible for subsidized coverage, either through Medicaid or tax credits to help purchase coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. But it’s unclear how many would enroll in such coverage. ""We did not estimate take-up or enrollment in coverage options but rather only looked at eligibility for coverage,"" KFF said.
Bloomberg’s Manufacturing Jobs
Bloomberg oversimplified, inappropriately compared apples to oranges, and misled when he said, ""Biden helped save 1 million auto industry jobs [but] Trump has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs.""
Note first that Bloomberg compared ""auto industry"" jobs with ""manufacturing"" jobs. They are not the same thing. The auto industry includes management, sales, service and transport jobs in addition to production-line workers. That’s comparing apples to fruit salad, actually.
It may be true that 1 million ""auto industry"" jobs were saved because of the auto bailout Biden supported in 2009. The Center for Automotive Research estimated that it saved 1.5 million jobs in 2010, including those at the automakers, auto suppliers and ""spin-off employment"" in other industries. But it’s a fact that despite the auto bailout, overall, 578,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during the Obama-Biden first term — and not all were regained during their final four years.
And the fact is that manufacturing jobs increased during Trump’s term — prior to the COVID-19 crisis. They also increased for much of Obama’s time — but only after huge losses in his recession-plagued first years, losses that were not completely regained until after Trump took office.
It’s true that there were 257,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in July than there were when the president took office. Bloomberg is right to that extent. But that’s a net figure — the momentary position of a roller-coaster that is still in motion.
As of February there had been a gain of 483,000 manufacturing jobs under Trump — significantly more than the 386,000 gain during Obama’s final four years. Then nearly 1.4 million of those jobs went away, at least temporarily, in March and April. Nearly half of them were regained in May, June and July.
Correction, Aug. 26: We initially said the convention ended on Aug. 21. It was Aug. 20.

      Trump Spreads Distorted Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding

		3The Wuhan Institute of Virology received $600,000 as part of a larger five-year U.S. government grant to a U.S.-based nonprofit studying emerging infectious diseases. But President Donald Trump put the figure at $7.5 million, saying he ""ended it.""
We asked the White House where the $7.5 million figure may have come from, but we haven’t received a response.
False claims that the Wuhan lab had received $3.7 million in National Institutes of Health grant money have circulated online after an April 11 Daily Mail story made that assertion and Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz repeated it in a Fox News interview. The NIH didn’t award such a grant. Instead, it gave a grant totaling $3.4 million, beginning in 2014, to the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance to study the risk of the future emergence of coronaviruses from bats. And EcoHealth distributed $600,000 of that total to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a collaborator on the project, pre-approved by NIH.
We wrote about this distortion of the EcoHealth grant after the claim appeared in the conspiracy theory video ""Plandemic.""
Trump echoed the claim in an interview that aired May 14 on Fox Business News. Host Maria Bartiromo asked of the Wuhan institute, ""Didn’t we as a country give money to that lab?"" Trump responded:
Trump, May 14: Yeah. As I understand it, before I got here, $7.5 million in 2014. And look, they said they were studying different things and you know, things like that happen. But, you know, money was given by the Obama administration early on. … I ended it. … I took a lot of heat too. They said, ""Oh, we’re studying all sorts of stuff."" You saw what happened. I ended it.
It’s unclear what other funding the president may be including in his figure. An April 16 Fox News story cited another $3.4 million grant, regarding a behavioral study, that may have included some funding that went to the Wuhan lab. But the grant, which was awarded to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, hasn’t been terminated. It was originally for 2014-2019 and a second related grant was approved this year. We reached out to Cold Spring Harbor Lab, and we’ll update this story if we receive additional information.
Fox News acknowledged that it was ""not clear exactly how much U.S. funding went directly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the American grants.""
Update, June 18: When we revisited this issue for another story, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory told us no money from its grant went to the Wuhan lab. ""[B]ased on CSHL’s records for its NIH R01 award MH101214, there is nothing to indicate that any money from this grant was provided to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Dagnia Zeidlickis, the lab’s vice president of communications, told us in an email.
In the case of the EcoHealth grant — the one that was canceled — we do know how much went to the Wuhan lab and it was well short of even $1 million.
In a statement, the NIH said the total grant to EcoHealth was $3.4 million over six years (2014 through 2019) and that the grant had been terminated. ""NIH does not discuss details of the decision making process regarding specific grant awards,"" the statement said. Information on the NIH website shows the project began on June 1, 2014, and was ended on April 24, 2020.
Nearly all of the $3.4 million was part of a five-year grant awarded in 2014, EcoHealth spokesman Robert Kessler told us in an email, and the $600,000 given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology was part of that grant. In 2019, the project was renewed for another five years, and EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 before NIH canceled the grant last month.
USA Today reported that about $76,000 had been budgeted for the Wuhan lab as part of the 2019 renewal. Kessler confirmed to us that money had been budgeted but it hadn’t been distributed to the lab before the grant was ended.
The Wuhan, China, lab — located in the city where the novel coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019 — was pre-approved as a collaborator by NIH and the State Department, Kessler said. Researchers used the lab to conduct genetic analyses of the viruses.
""In each of nearly 30 countries around the world where we work, we collaborate with local institutions, all of which are pre-approved by our federal funders,"" EcoHealth said in an April 28 statement about the terminated funding. ""It’s been EcoHealth Alliance’s position for the past 15 years that coronaviruses present a clear and immediate threat to our safety. That seems clearer now than ever before.""
The NIH grant — technically funded through the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — backed research into the emergence of coronaviruses that can affect humans and originate in bats, which is the origin, experts suspect, of SARS-CoV-2, or the novel coronavirus, as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which caused a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, identified in 2012.
The EcoHealth project description on the NIH website says that zoonotic coronaviruses — meaning those that can transfer from animals to humans — ""are a significant threat to global health"" and that bats ""appear to be the natural reservoir of these viruses."" The project ""aims to understand what factors increase the risk of the next CoV emerging in people by studying CoV diversity in a critical zoonotic reservoir (Bats), at sites of high risk for emergence (wildlife markets) in an emerging disease hotspot (China).""
EcoHealth, which has received government grant money nearly every year since 2002, according to an NIH database, said in its April 28 statement that the research terminated by the Trump administration ""aimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats. In fact, genetic sequences of two bat coronaviruses that we discovered with this grant have been used as lab tools to test the breakthrough antiviral drug Remdesivir.""
Clinical trials are underway to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization on May 1 for the drug based on early results.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been the subject of baseless conspiracy theories claiming SARS-CoV-2 was created or manipulated in a lab. As we’ve written, the authors of a March article in Nature Medicine concluded: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.""
University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of SARS-CoV-2, also said in an April statement: ""Coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 are commonly found in wildlife species and frequently jump to new hosts. This is also the most likely explanation for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.""
Responding to what he called ""unfounded speculation"" that a bat coronavirus named RaTG13, being kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was the origin, Holmes said that for various reasons he concluded: ""SARS-CoV-2 was not derived from RaTG13."" Holmes said more sampling of other animals ""is needed to resolve the exact origins"" of the novel coronavirus.
The U.S. Intelligence Community said in an April 30 statement that it ""concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,"" and that it ""will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.""
In remarks the same day, Trump answered, ""Yes, I have,"" when asked if he had ""seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus."" But the president also said: ""We’re going to see where it comes from. And you know — look, you know every theory, whether you had the theory from the lab, you had the theory from many different — the bats, and the type of bat, and the bat is 40 miles away, so it couldn’t have been here and it couldn’t have been there. And we have a — there’s a lot of theories. But, yeah, we have people looking at it very, very strongly.""
Investigations into the origin of the virus aside, Trump was wrong to claim the U.S. government has given $7.5 million to the Wuhan lab under his predecessor. The lab received only $600,000 through a five-year grant to EcoHealth Alliance, a grant that spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations and had been renewed last year. We don’t know how much, if anything, the lab may have received as part of other grants.
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for ""more investigation"" to determine how the pandemic began. ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,"" they wrote. ""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""
Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story ""The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus"" for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic.

      Misinformation, Speculation Follow Trump COVID-19 Diagnosis

		The news that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump contracted the novel coronavirus led to a wave of social media posts spreading misinformation — and politically charged speculation.
Some of posts tapped into baseless conspiracy theories, and others shared outright falsehoods, as we’ll explain.
First, here’s some of what we know about the matter:

Trump announced early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus, which causes COVID-19. ""Tonight, @FLOTUS  and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!"" he wrote shortly before 1 a.m.
That announcement followed breaking news by Bloomberg News that a Trump aide, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the virus. Hicks had been traveling with Trump in recent days.
The White House later released a memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, Trump’s White House physician, dated Oct. 1, which in part said: ""This evening I received confirmation that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.""
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing ""mild symptoms.""
A subsequent memo from Conley specified that Trump had ""PCR-confirmation"" — a reference to a standard testing method — and said Trump received a ""single 8 gram dose of Regeneron’s polyclonal antibody cocktail"" and other medicine. The ""President remains fatigued but in good spirits,"" Conley said, adding that Melania Trump ""remains well with only a mild cough and headache.""
Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Speculation, Conspiracy Theories Floated
In the hours immediately following Trump’s announcement, with few other details available, some turned to speculation. Others shared conspiracy theories.
Among the posts to gain traction online were posts suggesting that the president was not actually sick, but using a fabricated diagnosis to benefit his reelection campaign. On the other side, some implied without substantiation that ""the left"" may have deliberately spread the virus to him.
Neither notion is supported by available evidence.
One popular Facebook post cast doubt on the diagnosis by saying that Trump ""needed a ‘reset'"" for his campaign and therefore the diagnosis may be a ""con.""
Another widely shared post raised the suspicion that the diagnosis may be a bid at ""free publicity"" and a move to get out of the next debate with his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
Asked on Fox News what would happen in terms of the Oct. 15 presidential debate — which falls within the 14-day quarantine window — White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, ""We haven’t gotten that far just yet.""
On Twitter, DeAnna Lorraine — a far-right candidate who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory and launched a failed bid for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s seat — speculated on Twitter that Trump may have been intentionally infected during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29.
Lorraine offered no evidence to support her speculation in her original tweet, which said: ""Trump was fine until the debate, where they set up microphones & podiums for him. Incubation period is usually 2-3 days. He tests positive a couple of days after the debate. I put nothing past the left. NOTHING."" She didn’t respond to our request for information.
But the tweet was shared more than 6,000 times within hours of being posted. Lorraine herself later responded to another Twitter user, saying, ""Impossible to prove, but something that needs to be in the discussion.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 spreads mostly through respiratory droplets — created when people sneeze, cough or talk. That’s why public health officials recommend wearing masks.
""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,"" according to the CDC. ""This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads.""
During the debate, though, not everyone in the room was wearing a mask. Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor who moderated the event, reported on Oct. 2 that the Trump family didn’t wear masks in the debate hall, while Biden’s supporters did. ""There was a difference in the way the two families and their camps treated the health-safety regulations inside the hall,"" Wallace said.
Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones added to the unfounded claims online, suggesting that the test result may be part of a ""coup."" In a video address Oct. 2, Jones said that the result may have been a ""false positive,"" which would allow an adversary in the White House to poison the president’s soda and later say that he suffered from COVID-19.
Jones gave no evidence to support this theory. There is no evidence suggesting that the president’s illness is part of a coup.
But other purveyors of dubious claims echoed the fear of a coup, including a right-wing commentator who goes by Ali Alexander on Twitter. He warned his 126,000 followers that this may be a ""second coup.""
Doomsday Plane Claims
A rumor spread across social media claiming that so-called ""doomsday planes"" were deployed because of Trump’s test result.
They weren’t.
Two E-6B Mercury planes were in flight around the time that Trump announced he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. But the flights were pre-planned and the timing was coincidental, Karen Singer, spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. Training flights like those are usually planned a year in advance, Singer said.
The planes, which have various nicknames, can be used as command centers and can launch land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. But that’s not what they were doing at the time.
Bogus Trump Campaign ‘Email’
An image that spread on Twitter early Oct. 2 purported to show an email from the president’s reelection campaign and suggested that the president was immediately using the COVID-19 diagnosis to raise money.
But as we reported, the Trump campaign confirmed to us that the image did not show an actual email from the campaign.
Instead, the image appeared to be a joke.
The bogus email claimed at one point that the goal was to raise ""421 million.""
That is the same figure referenced in a New York Times investigation, which found that Trump ""appears to be responsible for loans totaling $421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.""
Twisted ‘Hoax’ Remark
Critics of Trump reacted to the diagnosis by revisiting his handling of the pandemic. But some posts shared on social media distorted a statement that Trump made in February to do so.
""The coronavirus. This is their new hoax,"" one Facebook meme misleadingly quoted Trump as saying.
Another meme criticizing Trump, posted by the Occupy Democrats page and shared 21,000 times, also repeated the same, faulty quote.
Trump didn’t say ""the coronavirus"" immediately before ""this is their new hoax."" That’s how a Democratic super PAC later twisted the quote, as we wrote in April.
The actual remark dates back to a Trump rally on Feb. 28, when the president referred to Democrats’ ""new hoax"" after talking about the coronavirus. But, as we’ve explained before, he said the next day that he was describing Democrats’ finding fault with his administration’s response to the virus, not the virus itself.
Here’s a transcript of what he said during the rally:
Trump, Feb. 28: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ""How’s President Trump doing?"" They go, ""Oh, not good, not good."" They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia."" That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. 
Trump went on to praise his administration for some travel restrictions the U.S. had implemented. ""A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,"" Trump said, ""and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right?""
The next day, when asked about his use of the word hoax, Trump said he was ""certainly not"" referring to the virus itself.
""‘Hoax’ referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we’ve done such a good job,"" he said. ""The hoax is on them, not — I’m not talking about what’s happening here; I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.""

		Quick Take
A social media post falsely claims that ""the United States is the only country on earth that is protesting"" stay-at-home restrictions and business closures. People around the world have opposed mitigation measures designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus because of economic hardship and concerns over personal freedoms.
Full Story
As COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, began to spread from its place of origin in Wuhan, China, other countries instituted social distancing policies and lockdowns to curb its transmission. Nations have ordered businesses to close, imposed travel restrictions, issued stay-at-home orders and established curfews, resulting in protests against these measures around the world. 
But a post that has been shared widely on Twitter and Facebook wrongly claims that only Americans have protested these preventative measures.
The claim originated on Twitter from Robert James Pangelinan, a music DJ who works under the name Bear Grillz.
""Honest question: why do you think the United States is the only country on earth that is protesting being locked down?"" he tweeted on May 1. Another user replied, ""Because people who have never truly been oppressed are being inconvenienced for the first time in their lives and don’t understand what it means to sacrifice in the name of the greater good. Individualist culture, institutionalized racism, commodity fetishism and selfishness."" 
Both tweets were then made into a screenshot and posted to Facebook, where it has garnered hundreds of shares and tens of thousands of views.
Indeed, there have been many demonstrations across the U.S. urging an end to stay-at-home policies and criticizing the governors who have issued the orders. But this is part of a worldwide trend spurred by worries about the economy and potential government overreach. For example:

In Poland, hundreds gathered on April 24 to protest closed borders and a mandatory two-week quarantine policy for people entering the country. Many protesters had jobs in Germany and couldn’t go to work.
In India, migrant workers violated social distancing policies during a May 9 protest that resulted in confrontations with the police. Protesters sought to raise awareness of the plight of migrant workers, many of whom lost their jobs and were prevented from traveling home due to the lockdown.
In Belgium, restaurant workers brought attention to the economic impact of social distancing policies on the hospitality industry by laying down chefs’ jackets in the Grand Place square in Brussels on May 7.
In Ivory Coast, protesters destroyed the construction site of a coronavirus testing center in early April over concerns that the facility would be a danger to residents.

Protests continued within these countries and in others, including Iraq, Lebanon, and the UK. 
As for the claim in the social media posts that Americans are protesting because they ""are being inconvenienced,"" people have taken to the streets in the U.S. for a variety of reasons. While some protesters have touted conspiracy theories about the virus — many of which we’ve debunked — others have expressed concerns about the economic impact of the virus. The number of jobless Americans rose to 20.5 million in April, and the unemployment rate more than tripled to 14.7% from March to April.

      Birx Spins ‘Extraordinarily Low Numbers’ of Coronavirus Cases

		Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, misleadingly claimed that 19 states — ""almost 40% of the country"" — ""have less than 200 cases"" of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. In fact, 17 states with 7.2% of the U.S. population have fewer than 200 confirmed cases each.
Birx made her remarks at a task force press briefing at the White House on March 26 on a day when the United States passed China and became the country with the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. As of March 26, the U.S. had more than 83,000 confirmed cases and more than 1,200 deaths, according to data collected by John Hopkins University.
At the same briefing, President Donald Trump spoke about wanting to soon open ""large sections of our country that aren’t so seriously affected."" The president has said he would ""love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" as he put it during a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24.
Public health officials have warned that going back to business in a couple of weeks would worsen the coronavirus outbreak. ""This disease will not respect state borders and city borders, and will move around this country just like it’s moved around the world,"" Tom Inglesby, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the New York Times.
Birx — formerly the U.S. global AIDS coordinator — lent support to Trump’s basic message that large sections of the U.S. aren’t seriously affected. But she was actually speaking about a small section of the country in terms of population.
Birx, March 26: So just as a summary of where it looks domestically — I won’t talk so much about the global issues this time: We do have 19 out of our 50 states, to be reminded, that had early cases but have persistently low level of cases and, at this point, have less than 200 cases. So that’s almost 40% of the country with extraordinarily low numbers.
It’s true that 19 states divided by 50 states is 38%, or ""almost 40%."" That’s ""basic math,"" as a White House official told us. But it’s also misleading.
First, using the data collected by John Hopkins University, we found that only 17 states — not 19 — had fewer than 200 cases as of March 26, when Birx made her remarks.

Second, those 17 states have a combined population of 23,719,483, or just 7.2% of the total U.S. population of 328,239,523, according to 2019 population estimates by the Census Bureau. (See the pie chart below.)



Five of the 17 states have fewer than 1 million people each. South Dakota, population 884,659, had the fewest COVID-19 confirmed cases with 46 cases, according to John Hopkins University.
California alone has more residents than the 17 states combined. The Golden State has a population of 39.5 million people. It also has 3,899 confirmed cases as of March 26.
The 17 states have 1,872, or 2.2%, of the total cases nationwide.
We would caution that these are only the confirmed cases, based on the testing the states have done. Some tests may still be pending, and some states have conducted more testing than others.
But while Birx boasts about ""almost 40% of the country with extraordinarily low numbers,"" the fact is that only 7.2% of the population lives in those states.

		For the first time since Election Day, President Donald Trump will stage a political rally — traveling to Valdosta, Georgia, to campaign on Dec. 5 for the state’s two Republican senators.
Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler were unable to get 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, forcing both into Jan. 5 runoff elections against their respective Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.
In advance of Trump’s visit, we recap here our fact-checking reports on the Georgia races — which will decide control of the Senate.
We also review the president’s false, misleading and unfounded statements about alleged election fraud in Georgia — a state that President-elect Joe Biden won by nearly 13,000 votes, according to the state’s certified election results.
Trump’s Election Fraud Allegations
Georgia signature checks: In a nearly 46-minute video that he posted on social media on Dec. 2, Trump wrongly claimed Georgia didn’t properly check signatures from mail-in ballots and misleadingly claimed the signature checks were left out of the recount.
""In the recent recount in Georgia, which means nothing because they don’t want to check signatures, and if you’re not going to check signatures in Georgia, it doesn’t work,"" Trump said. ""But we have a secretary of state, and a governor who made it very difficult to check signatures.""
As we have written, Georgia election officials check signatures twice: once when a voter requests a mail-in ballot, and then again when the ballot is returned. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said Georgia strengthened its signature match for this election, and trained election officials on Georgia Bureau of Investigation signature-matching techniques. Trump is correct that signature checks were not part of the hand recount. Once a signature is verified on the ballot’s outer envelope, the ballot is separated from the envelope for counting. This protects voter privacy.
Rejected ballots in Georgia: Trump again falsely claimed that the percentage of ballots rejected in Georgia was suspiciously low.
""In swing state after swing state, the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience,"" Trump said. ""In Georgia, just 0.2%, that’s substantially less than 1%, of mail-in ballots have been rejected. … Nothing was rejected, practically, compared to 6.4% in 2016.""
As he has in the past, Trump is conflating the ballots rejected just for signature issues in this election with ballots rejected in past elections for all reasons — usually for arriving too late. The percentage of mail-in ballots rejected in Georgia due to signature issues this year was about the same as in the 2016 and 2018 general elections.
Missed votes in Georgia: Trump falsely suggested that many votes from Trump supporters in Georgia remain uncounted. ""Thousands of uncounted ballots were discovered in Floyd, Fayette, and Walton counties weeks after the election, and these ballots were mostly from Trump voters. They weren’t counted. They were from Trump voters,"" he said.
It’s true that almost 6,000 previously uncounted or unreported votes in those counties (and Douglas County) were discovered by officials during Georgia’s hand recount of ballots after the election. But those votes for Trump and Biden have since been included in the overall tallies and didn’t change the outcome.
Gabriel Sterling, the voting systems implementation manager for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, said that after including those additional votes for both candidates, Biden’s lead over Trump narrowed from 14,156 votes to 12,781 votes.
See ""Trump’s ‘Most Important’ Speech Was Mostly False"" for more.

Biden-only voters: In a Nov. 29 interview on Fox News, Trump baselessly said that ""there were a lot of ballots where it was just Biden on top,"" and no other candidates selected in the other races, because Democrats were rushing to forge ballots for Biden.
""They say that I was doing so much better than they thought that they panicked, and they started just doing ballot after ballot very quickly and just checking the Biden name on top. They didn’t have time,"" Trump said, not explaining who ""they"" were. ""So, you have all these ballots with just one name checked. People don’t vote that way.""
In making this unsupported claim, Trump repeated a flawed conspiracy theory that one of his campaign advisers, Steve Cortes, previously had suggested about Georgia. Cortes claimed ""there were almost 96,000 people in Georgia, allegedly, who voted Biden-only and then did not vote for Senate.""
Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us it is not possible to know how many Georgians voted for Biden and no other candidate. That ""would require individual-level information from ballots, not aggregation information about ballots cast in each race,"" he said. 
Instead, while Biden garnered more votes than Ossoff in Georgia, that’s likely because of ticket-splitting, when a voter picks a presidential candidate of one party and a Senate candidate of another party, and ""ballot roll-off,"" which is when voters skip certain races.
See ""Trump Repeats Baseless, False Claims About the Election"" and ""Faulty Claim About ‘Biden-Only’ Ballots in Georgia"" for more.

Two days after Election Day, Trump made several unfounded, baseless and specious claims at the White House about alleged election counting issues in Georgia.
Stopped counting: Trump claimed that he ""won by a lot … with a lead of over getting close to 300,000 votes on election night in Georgia."" But ""a pipe burst in a far away location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours,"" saying ""a lot of things happened"" during that time to steal the election from him.
But the Trump campaign has provided no evidence of fraud. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, a water leak at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, which serves as a ballot processing site, caused a several hours delay in vote-counting on election night. No ballots were damaged, and vote processing resumed normally.
In a Nov. 21 opinion piece for the Washington Post, Raffensperger described the state’s election process he oversaw as ""secure, reliable and efficient,"" dismissing criticism of it as ""unfair and unwarranted.""
Post-election votes: Trump claimed that votes were ""coming in after Election Day"" in Georgia. But there is no evidence to support his claim.
The Trump campaign and the Georgia Republican Party filed a lawsuit that included an affidavit from a Republican poll observer who expressed concern that 53 ballots may have been received in Chatham County after the 7 p.m. deadline on Election Day but intermingled with on-time ballots. Superior Court Judge James Bass dismissed the lawsuit, stating: ""[T]he Court finds that there is no evidence that the ballots referenced in the petition were received after 7:00 p.m. on election day, thereby making those ballots invalid.""
Election observers: Trump also claimed — without evidence — that his campaign had been ""denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia."" David Shafer, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, specifically claimed that GOP observers were denied proper access in Fulton County, where Atlanta is located. 
But in a press conference on Nov. 6, Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, said that while there have been allegations in other states about monitors not being allowed to watch the counts, ""In Georgia, this process is and will remain open and transparent to monitors.""
See ""Trump’s Wild, Baseless Claims of Illegal Voting"" for more.

Perdue-Ossoff Race
A Perdue TV ad misleadingly claimed that Ossoff would ""defund police"" and provide ""voting rights for illegal immigrants."" 
Ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police. And while he supports providing a pathway to citizenship to some 11 million immigrants currently in the country illegally, he does not support voting rights for noncitizens.
An Ossoff TV ad offered similar side-by-side comments from Perdue and Trump that the ad contends show Perdue ""ignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.""
We’ll leave it to readers to decide for themselves if Perdue’s comments did that, but some of the comments highlighted in the ad came early in the year at a time when medical experts were making similar comments. And Perdue made other comments warning about the seriousness of the virus and reinforcing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to reduce the spread of the virus.
See ""Opening Ads in the Perdue-Ossoff Runoff"" for more.

Ossoff’s production company received payments from a Hong Kong media company and Al Jazeera for the rights to air investigative pieces, but a Republican TV ad misleadingly claimed Ossoff got cash from ""Chinese communists and terrorist sympathizers.""
See ""Twisting the Facts on ‘Dirty Money’ in the Georgia Race"" for more.

A Republican TV ad falsely suggested that ""liberal megadonors"" are spending $1 billion in ""dark money"" to help Ossoff in the runoff race. That’s how much multiple experts estimate may be spent on all candidates in both Georgia Senate elections for the entire 2020 campaign.
See ""A Misleading Dark Money Attack on Ossoff"" for more.

An ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee misleadingly says Jon Ossoff ""praised"" the Green New Deal, a proposal that Ossoff has repeatedly said that he does not support. 
See ""NRSC’s Dual Attack on Warnock and Ossoff"" for more.

Loeffler-Warnock Race
An ad from Warnock claimed that Loeffler ""immediately"" began ""dumping stocks"" after a January Senate briefing about the coronavirus. But his campaign provided no evidence she made that investment decision. Loeffler has said her family’s investments are managed by third-party advisers without her input. Also, the Senate’s ethics panel investigated allegations that Loeffler may have violated federal laws or Senate rules against insider trading and found no evidence that she had. 
A Loeffler ad claimed that Warnock ""hosted a rally for Communist dictator Fidel Castro"" in 1995. But her campaign has provided no evidence that Warnock, who was a youth pastor for a Harlem-based church at the time, was involved in inviting Cuba’s former dictator to speak at that church more than two decades ago.
Loeffler’s ad also said Warnock ""called police thugs and gangsters,"" leaving out that his comments were specific to the circumstances surrounding the death of Michael Brown, a young Black man who was shot and killed in 2014 by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. His campaign said he wasn’t referring to all officers.
See ""Loeffler-Warnock Runoff Starts with Attack Ads"" for more.

A conservative group’s deceptive TV ad suggested that Warnock supports defunding the police. He has said multiple times that he doesn’t.
See ""Ad Links Warnock to ‘Defunding the Police’"" for more.

An NRSC ad says Warnock ""supports cashless bail for criminals,"" which ""puts the most violent right back into our neighborhoods."" Warnock’s campaign has said that he ""supports ending cash bail for nonviolent misdemeanor offenders, not an all out ban on cash bail.""
In 2018, for example, Warnock, the senior pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, supported an ordinance approved by the Atlanta City Council that eliminated the requirement for individuals charged with committing certain low-level crimes to pay a cash bond to secure their pretrial release from custody.

      Trump Distorts WHO’s Lockdown Comments

		At campaign rallies and in tweets, President Donald Trump falsely said the World Health Organization changed its position and ""admitted that Donald Trump was right"" about lockdowns. But the agency has said no such thing.
The president first made the inaccurate claim in a tweet just before the start of an Oct. 12 rally in Sanford, Florida.

The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2020

At the rally, Trump echoed that sentiment after stating that former Vice President Joe Biden would institute a lockdown if elected president.
Trump, Oct. 12: Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate Florida’s economy with the draconian unscientific lockdown. That’s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. …
But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago and they admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states where they’re locked out, sealed up, suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, death by so many different forms. 
We’ve previously explained that Biden said in an Aug. 21 interview with ABC News that he would shut down the country if that’s what scientists advised. He has since emphasized that he doesn’t think a lockdown would be necessary.
A day after the Florida rally, Trump repeated the claim in a tweet attacking National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci — who has pushed back against a Trump television ad that Fauci said took his words ""out of context.""
""WHO no longer likes Lockdowns – just came out against. Trump was right,"" he wrote. ""We saved 2,000,000 USA lives!!!""
In another rally that night in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the president again said that the WHO ""said Trump was right"" and boasted about having saved 2 million lives.
The Trump campaign told us that the president was referencing statements recently made by WHO officials and directed us to two news articles highlighting comments by Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, and David Nabarro, one of the WHO’s special envoys on COVID-19.
In one of the articles cited by the campaign, Ryan was quoted as saying this during an Oct. 9 press briefing: ""What we want to try and avoid — and sometimes it’s unavoidable, we accept that, but what we want to try and avoid are these massive lockdowns that are so punishing to communities, to societies and everything else.""
Nabarro’s remarks came from an Oct. 8 interview with the British magazine The Spectator. While Nabarro spoke at length, news outlets focused on his plea to world leaders to ""stop using lockdown as your primary control method.""
But Trump’s description of their remarks is inaccurate and incomplete. Neither man mentioned Trump or the U.S., and the WHO told us that its position on lockdowns has not changed — it has never recommended them as the primary strategy to control the virus, but recognizes that in some cases they may be needed.
Trump also incorrectly suggested that ""Democrat-run states"" are currently in lockdown, when no state is shut down the way many were in the spring.
Confusingly, Trump simultaneously claimed that 2 million American lives were saved — a dubious estimate — even though the stay-at-home orders most states issued this spring likely limited the number of COVID-19 deaths.
WHO’s Position on Lockdowns
While Trump’s takeaway from Ryan and Nabarro’s comments was that the WHO was reversing itself, that’s an inaccurate interpretation.
""WHO has never advocated for national lockdowns as a primary means for controlling the virus. Dr Nabarro was repeating our advice to governments to ‘do it all,’"" the agency’s press office told us in an email.
""Governments, employers, communities should apply a package of proven public health measures that we know are effective for preventing transmission, including hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, mask wearing, staying home if you’re sick, etc. as well as having robust systems for testing, isolating, tracing and quarantining, etc.,"" the statement continued. ""Measures to control COVID-19 depend on local risk assessments. Movement restrictions may be among a range of measures that governments can consider in certain geographical areas.""
""If clusters and outbreaks do appear, they should be slowed and then suppressed promptly and that is why localised and targeted movement restrictions, implemented jointly by local actors and national authorities, are needed from time to time,"" the press office added.
Nabarro’s statements in the interview are entirely consistent with that assessment. He explained that the WHO backed a ""middle way"" strategy involving a robust testing, contact tracing and isolation system, along with getting the public on board with physical distancing, wearing masks and other similar measures.
""If we can combine those various steps, what we call ‘doing it all,’ in our organization’s speak, then we can get on top of it,"" he said, noting that that is exactly what many East Asian countries have done, along with Germany and parts of Canada.
""We think lockdowns only serve one purpose, and that is to give you a bit of breathing space to stop everything,"" Nabarro said. ""The virus stops moving, and while you’ve got that breathing space, you should really be building up your testing, building up your contact tracing, building up your local organization.""
Later, he emphasized that point again, saying, ""We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted.""
In an Oct. 13 Twitter thread, the agency also iterated its position, noting that lockdowns were not ideal, but might be necessary.
""We understand that sometimes such measures – although not sustainable – are needed to swiftly suppress the virus and avoid health systems being overwhelmed,"" the WHO said. ""Lockdowns are not sustainable solutions because of their significant economic, social & broader health impacts. However, during the #COVID19 pandemic there’ve been times when restrictions were necessary and there may be other times in the future.""
States Aren’t in ‘Lockdown’
Related to Trump’s claim about the WHO is the idea that certain states — namely, Democratic states — are in lockdown and should reopen. But that’s a straw man argument, as no state is still under a highly restrictive stay-at-home order. 
According to a New York Times tracker, many states still have some kind of restriction in place, such as closures or capacity limits on certain businesses, most commonly restaurants and bars or entertainment venues and cinemas that are at higher risk for spreading the virus.
These limits, however, are quite different from the more stringent orders 42 states and territories implemented in March through May, which frequently involved closing all nonessential businesses and required people to stay at home unless they were out for an essential activity.
Previously, the president has inaccurately said that Michigan is ""closed,"" as we’ve written, even though the governor lifted the state’s stay-at-home order on June 1.
As for New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced new temporary restrictions for specific hotspot areas on Oct. 6, but this doesn’t mean the entire state is under a lockdown. Only six portions of five counties, which are concentrated in the New York City area, are affected.
In the worst-off areas in New York, identified as ""red zones,"" only essential businesses can remain open; dining is limited to takeout only; in-person schools are closed; and there’s a capacity limit for houses of worship.
The targeted approach, which the state developed with public health experts, is consistent with the WHO’s advice to keep movement restrictions localized. 
Two Million ‘Saved’ Lives
At the same time Trump is disparaging lockdowns in his tweets and rallies, he also mentions that 2 million American lives were saved — an odd feature to highlight, since state-issued stay-at-home orders likely helped avoid COVID-19 deaths.
""We saved 2 million lives,"" Trump said during his Johnstown rally. ""They said 2.2 million people, we saved 2 million lives and you know we get nothing.""
As of Oct. 14, more than 216,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker — although the true death toll is almost certainly higher.
We’ve explained before that an early model from Imperial College London projected in March that the U.S. could lose 2.2 million people to the pandemic. But that high death toll assumed no mitigation measures were used at all — and that people also wouldn’t modify their behavior.
In other words, it’s not necessarily a realistic benchmark against which to measure the administration’s success. 
Research does support the idea that lockdowns — which were instituted by states, not Trump — saved lives earlier this year, although it’s hard to say how many. 
A paper published in the journal Nature concluded that lockdowns prevented some 60 million infections in the U.S., but didn’t venture a guess as to how many deaths were averted.
Similarly, Columbia University researchers estimated that if the U.S. had implemented social distancing one week earlier in March, 36,000 fewer people would have died.

		SciCheck Digest
A tweet shared on Instagram baselessly claims that a person is 300 to 900 times more likely to die ""after getting the #Covid vaccine than the flu vaccine.""  But the comparison is faulty — and there is no proof that people are dying from COVID-19 vaccines.

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How do we know vaccines are safe?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

Full Story
A Feb. 15 tweet, subsequently shared on Instagram, cites unvetted information submitted to a federal database to baselessly claim that COVID-19 vaccines are significantly more dangerous than influenza vaccines. Experts, however, say that’s a misuse of the numbers — and the suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines are killing one in every 10,000 immunized people is groundless.
""How much more likely are you to die after getting the #Covid vaccine than the flu vaccine?"" the tweet, from novelist and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, begins.
""300-900 times, based on federal VAERS reports. Yes, 900,"" he answers, referring to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, adding that for COVID-19 vaccines, it’s ""1 death reported per 35,000 shots or 10,000 completed vaccinations (so far),"" but for flu ""1 death per 9,000,000 vaccinations.""
""That’s a safe vaccine,"" Berenson then says of the flu vaccine. ""Those deaths are likely coincidental, a simple result of the number of shots given. The #Covid vax, not so much.""
But Berenson’s analysis relies on the fallacy that any death that occurs after vaccination must be related to the vaccine.
""VAERS does not determine death, period,"" a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us. ""Just because somebody reports death doesn’t mean that the vaccine caused the death. So we don’t use VAERS to determine death rates or anything concerning death.""
In terms of the number of death reports following each vaccine at the time of his tweet, Berenson’s numbers check out. The CDC, for example, had written on its website that as of Feb. 7, 1,170 deaths had been reported to VAERS following the administration of 41 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. That’s around one report per 35,000 doses. (The number listed on the website is now 934 death reports out of 52 million doses, through Feb. 14; a CDC spokesperson said the decline is because the agency switched to include only domestic reports to match the number of doses administered in the U.S.)
But the comparison to flu is problematic, and the conclusion that COVID-19 vaccines are therefore unsafe is unfounded. 
Reports through VAERS do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused the adverse event, as anyone can submit reports, regardless of whether an immunization is thought to have contributed. When deaths following receipt of a vaccine are reported, CDC and Food and Drug Administration physicians review those cases — and so far with the COVID-19 vaccines, there has been no link with immunization.
A CDC spokesperson told us that to date, the agency has not received confirmation of a single COVID-19 vaccine-related death. 
Update, May 19: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says ""women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen."" As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see ""Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause."" 
Moreover, experts said it’s not surprising that more death reports would be submitted to VAERS after COVID-19 immunizations compared with flu, given the increased attention on the vaccine.
""The difference in deaths reported following COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine administration is likely due to the enhanced reporting of all events occurring after COVID vaccination compared to after influenza vaccination,"" Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who also evaluates vaccines, told us.
Berenson, who frequently appears on conservative media, has previously misinterpreted a study to suggest that face masks are ineffective against the novel coronavirus. His tweets have formed the basis of another misleading claim online, also citing VAERS data, about adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines relative to flu vaccines.
Understanding VAERS
To understand why Berenson’s scary-seeming statistics should not be alarming, it’s useful to know how VAERS works and the limitations of its data.
As its website explains, VAERS is an early warning system that ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
The system accepts any report of a reaction that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and submissions are accepted ""without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine."" A disclaimer users must read before accessing the public data therefore warns that reports ""may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information,"" and notes that the utility of the data is limited because most reporting is voluntary.
The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety problem with a vaccine, which government scientists can then investigate. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, VAERS is just one of several vaccine safety monitoring systems the government has in place to ensure the safety of the vaccine as it’s rolled out to a wider population.
But VAERS data isn’t meant to allow safety comparisons between vaccines or to arrive at any sort of estimate of a person’s chances of dying following an immunization. Indeed, the disclaimer specifically cautions against doing the kind of math Berenson performs. ""The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines,"" it reads.
Instead, a CDC spokesperson said, when a serious adverse event such as death is reported, the agency collects information, including medical records, autopsy reports, death certificates — and a qualified physician determines the cause of death.
""We look for patterns, we look for warning signals — but we do not use VAERS to determine death or death rates,"" she said. ""Those have to be verified.""
Increased Reporting for COVID-19 Vaccines
Given the way that VAERS works, there are several reasons why there would be more reports of death following a COVID-19 vaccine in the system than for influenza vaccines — none of which would have anything to do with the vaccine’s actual safety profile.
""There’s a heightened awareness of this virus, and hence, heightened awareness of this vaccine,"" said Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee reviewing COVID-19 vaccines. 
The COVID-19 vaccines, too, have initially ""been geared toward an older population that is more likely to have medical problems,"" he said. Because the vaccines protect against COVID-19 but were ""not designed to prevent everything else that happens in life,"" Offit said, it’s expected that some number of people — especially the elderly — will die, entirely coincidentally, after receiving a vaccine. (SciCheck has addressed this before in ""Video Makes Bogus Claims About ‘War Crimes’ and COVID-19 Vaccine Safety."")
The CDC told us that reports of deaths occurring after COVID-19 immunization are under investigation, but that from the data thus far, ""it appears many of these deaths are among nursing home residents who had serious underlying conditions and death was not hastened by the vaccination.""
Atmar, of Baylor, who has made recommendations about influenza vaccines as part of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also said that it’s a mistake to overinterpret the VAERS death reports.
""Persons with underlying conditions and living in nursing homes/long-term care facilities die of their underlying conditions on a daily basis,"" he said in an email. During flu season, those deaths are unlikely to be reported to VAERS because they are not thought to be related to the flu vaccine, he explained. But with COVID-19, whether or not a death is thought to be due to the vaccine or a person’s medical condition, the deaths are being reported to VAERS.
""This ‘biased’ differential in reporting makes it appear that there is a difference in [the] death rate among recipients of the two types of vaccines,"" he said. ""Instead, what it represents is a difference in reporting.""
Because COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an emergency use authorization, there are in fact different reporting requirements to VAERS for the vaccines than for others. As is explained on the VAERS website, health care providers are required to report all deaths that occur after a COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of the suspected cause. 
With other vaccines, providers are encouraged to submit reports of death following vaccination, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause, but they are not required to do so unless the death occurs following a so-called reportable event for the vaccine, such as an allergic anaphylactic reaction.

		Quick Summary
Vaccine name: Ad26.COV2.S
Design type: Adenovirus viral vector 
Dose number: 1 dose
Efficacy: Overall, 66.1% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 in adults 28 days or more after vaccination, but efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical COVID-19) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively), where a new strain of coronavirus emerged.
Safety: In late April, the CDC and FDA warned that ""a causal relationship with Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is plausible for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia"" syndrome – a rare and dangerous blood clotting condition combined with low blood platelet levels. As of July 12, the CDC and FDA have confirmed 38 such cases, nearly all among adult women younger than 50. Also in July, the FDA warned of a possible increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome, based on preliminary reports of 100 cases. No serious safety concerns were reported during clinical trials. The shot, however, did elicit temporary side effects in some recipients, including pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, and muscle pain or ache. 
Expected dose availability: Nearly 4 million available immediately in the U.S. upon FDA authorization; 20 million by the end of March and 100 million by the end of June.
Expected timeline: On Feb. 27, the FDA authorized the vaccine for emergency use in adults age 18 and older. 
Operation Warp Speed involvement: The U.S. government provided about $1 billion for clinical trials and vaccine development. It spent another $1 billion for vaccine manufacturing, contracting for 100 million doses with an option to purchase up to another 200 million. 
Storage considerations: normal refrigerator temperature (36°F to 46°F) for at least three months; -13°F to 5°F for long-term storage.
More than two months after its last COVID-19 vaccine authorization, the FDA authorized for emergency use a one-shot vaccine from Janssen Biotech Inc., a Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company, on Feb. 27.
Unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which use an mRNA design, the Johnson & Johnson shot uses a harmless adenovirus — a type of virus that typically causes the common cold — modified with the genetic material for SARS-CoV-2 to trigger an immune response. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has the advantages of being one shot, not two, and being stored at regular refrigeration temperatures for up to three months. The Pfizer and Moderna two-shot vaccines can only be kept at refrigerator temperatures for five or 30 days, respectively.
Johnson & Johnson submitted its request for emergency use authorization on Feb. 4. An external panel advising the FDA met on Feb. 26, and voted unanimously (22 to 0) that ""based on the totality of scientific evidence available … the benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older."" The FDA then authorized the vaccine for emergency use the following day.
Johnson & Johnson Q&A
What is in the vaccine and how does it work?
The design is different from the mRNA vaccines authorized in December, but all of the vaccines fundamentally work in the same way: They trigger an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s spike protein, which sits on the surface of the virus and is what the virus uses to enter cells.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses another, harmless virus — adenovirus 26 — modified with DNA for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Adenoviruses typically cause common-cold symptoms, and for the vaccine, the virus is also modified so it can’t replicate in the body.
The modified adenovirus enters human cells, which then read the genetic material and begin making the coronavirus spike protein. This triggers the immune system, generating protective antibodies and activating other immune cells known as T cells.
In other words, the vaccine doesn’t include the COVID-19 virus, but rather, genetic material that prompts the body to produce an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 so that the body will recognize and react to the actual coronavirus if needed.
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert with the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, summarized how the vaccine works to CNN. ""So essentially it’s a sheep in wolf’s clothing, and when your immune system sees it, it responds to it and creates protection against it and in the future, against the real virus that causes Covid-19,"" he said.
How was the vaccine developed?
Johnson & Johnson has experience working with adenovirus-based vaccines, and gained approval in Europe in July for an Ebola vaccine that uses this technology.
The company is also working on adenovirus-based vaccines for HIV and Zika.
In January 2020, when the sequence for SARS-CoV-2 became available, Johnson & Johnson collaborated with Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to test multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates. At the end of March, researchers announced they had identified a lead candidate.
In July, J&J launched a phase 1/2a randomized controlled trial in the U.S. and Belgium with 1,051 participants ages 18 to 55 and over 65 to assess dosage, safety and immune response. The company also is conducting a phase 1 trial in Japan and a phase 2a in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands.
After the phase 1/2a trial showed a single dose of the vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19, J&J launched a phase 3 randomized controlled trial of a single dose. It began enrollment in the U.S. on Sept. 21, ultimately enrolling 44,325 people age 18 or older in the U.S., South Africa and six Latin American countries. Enrollment in that trial was complete on Dec. 17. The EUA application is based on the results of that trial, which is ongoing. Participants will be followed for two years.
J&J is also still enrolling participants for a second phase 3 randomized controlled trial in 10 countries, including the U.S., assessing a two-dose regimen. And it has planned future clinical studies of children, pregnant women and their infants, and immunocompromised individuals. 
How effective is the vaccine?
Overall, J&J reported 66.1% efficacy globally in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 in adults 28 days or more after vaccination, and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. The efficacy was similar across demographics including age, race and ethnicity.
The FDA noted in its briefing document that there were small numbers of participants 75 years and older in the phase 3 trial, creating ""limited interpretability"" on the efficacy rate for that subgroup, as well as ""insufficient"" data to assess efficacy in those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Moderate to severe disease was defined as a positive COVID-19 test result and either one respiratory-related or deep vein thrombosis symptom, or two symptoms from a list including fever, chills, sore throat, cough, malaise, headache and gastrointestinal upset, the FDA said. A severe/critical case was defined as a positive test result and one symptom including clinical sign of severe systemic illness, respiratory failure, shock, admission to the ICU and death.
As we’ve explained before, a 66.1% efficacy roughly means a vaccinated person has a 66.1% reduced risk of developing moderate disease, compared with a similar person who wasn’t immunized.
Due to new variants of the virus emerging in recent months, J&J provided data on efficacy by location, showing that the vaccine doesn’t appear to be as effective against the B.1.351 variant, which was first observed in South Africa.
In the U.S. population, there was 72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease, while than in South Africa, those figures were 64% and 81.7%, respectively.
In Brazil, where another variant first emerged, efficacy was closer to that of the U.S. population: 68.1% in preventing moderate to severe disease.
The vaccine had 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine — 28 days or more after vaccination.
As of Feb. 5, there were no COVID-19-related deaths in the vaccinated group and seven COVID-19-related deaths in the placebo group, the FDA briefing document said.
There may be some efficacy against asymptomatic cases. J&J said preliminary data suggest an effect ""based on a limited number of Day 71 results,"" but more investigation was needed.
The participants in the vaccinated group who developed moderate symptoms had ""fewer and less severe symptoms"" than those in the placebo group, J&J said. After 28 days post-vaccination, 66 people developed such symptoms in the vaccinated group, compared with 193 in the placebo group. For severe/critical cases, there were five in the vaccinated group and 34 in the placebo group.
The table below was part of Johnson & Johnson’s briefing document for the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

How safe is the vaccine?
There were ""no specific safety concerns"" identified in the trial, the FDA briefing document said. Some of those receiving the vaccine did report side effects, including injection site pain, headache, fatigue and myalgia (muscle pain or ache), generally lasting a day or two post-vaccination. These side effects were more common in 18- to 59-year-old participants.
Among the 44,325 participants in the phase 3 trial, 21,895 received the COVID-19 vaccine and 21,888 were in the placebo group.
The FDA determined three non-fatal serious adverse events in the vaccinated group were likely related to the vaccine: a hypersensitivity reaction involving urticaria or hives, injection site pain unresponsive to over-the-counter pain medicine, and a case involving a few days of symptoms including ""generalized malaise, weakness, myalgia, shortness of breath, headache, sensation of numbness and tingling in upper extremities, chest pain and fever.""
The FDA noted two reports of Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, in the vaccine group and two in the placebo group, and one case of Guillain-Barre Syndrome in each group. The FDA said those reports ""are unlikely related to study vaccine but a causal relationship cannot be definitively excluded.""  
Six vaccine recipients reported deep vein thrombosis, while two placebo recipients did so. Four vaccine recipients reported pulmonary embolism, as did one person in the placebo group. The FDA said there were risk factors among those individuals, but the imbalance between the vaccine and placebo groups meant that ""vaccine cannot be excluded as a contributing factor,"" recommending surveillance as the vaccine was deployed in larger populations.
There were also more reports of tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, among vaccine recipients: Six reports, compared with none in the placebo group. The FDA again said there was insufficient data to determine a causal relationship to the vaccine, complicated by the fact the individuals had risk factors.
And there were a few cases urticaria, or hives — eight in the vaccine group, three in the placebo group — which the FDA said are ""possibly related"" to the vaccine.
There were no reports of anaphylaxis immediately after vaccination; however, on Feb. 26, Johnson & Johnson said it had received a report of one such reaction in South Africa.
In late April, the CDC and the FDA added warnings to fact sheets for the J&J vaccine about a suggested increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, a dangerous condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The agencies had recommended a temporary 10-day pause in the use of the vaccine and investigated 15 cases of the rare condition among women, including three deaths, out of nearly 8 million vaccinations, as of April 21.
The CDC says of the J&J vaccine that ""women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen."" It says the reports the agencies investigated ""indicate a plausible causal relationship"" between the J&J vaccine and the rare condition ""which has caused deaths.""
As of July 12, the agencies had identified 38 total cases among more than 12.8 million J&J vaccines administered.
For more information, see ""Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.""
On July 13, the FDA added warnings to fact sheets on the vaccine about an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
The agency said the chance of developing the syndrome is ""very low"" but advised J&J vaccine recipients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms including weakness or tingling, particularly in the legs or arms; difficulty walking or with facial movement; double vision; or bladder control or bowel function issues.
The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases, with most people reporting symptoms within 42 days of vaccination. One death was reported, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine.
""Although the available evidence suggests an association between the Janssen vaccine and increased risk of GBS, it is insufficient to establish a causal relationship,"" the FDA said. About 3,000 to 6,000 people each year in the U.S. develop the syndrome, in which nerve cells are damaged by the immune system, leading to weakness and even paralysis, according to the FDA. The agency said that most recover fully.

A tweet that migrated across social media platforms falsely suggests that any deaths in the 20 days following positive COVID-19 tests are to be attributed to the disease, ""no matter what other factors were involved."" There is no such policy. And there’s also no evidence for the post’s suggestion that the vaccines are causing deaths that are being ignored.

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How lethal is COVID-19?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How lethal is COVID-19?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              It’s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn’t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.
The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the United States as of July 9.
An individual’s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person’s age or health conditions. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is more than 600 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29.

              How safe are the vaccines?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              Hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain — or no side effects at all. As the CDC has said, these vaccines ""have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.""
A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated.
As of Jan. 18, there have been 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those who develop anaphylaxis are usually given epinephrine, the drug found in EpiPens. None of these reactions has led to death. On Feb. 26, Johnson & Johnson said it had received a report of one anaphylactic reaction in South Africa.
To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn’t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, primarily in women ages 18 to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.
As of July 12, the syndrome has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine. There have been three deaths linked to the condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
In April, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use"" of the vaccine to investigate six reports of the syndrome out of more than 6.8 million immunizations. After a review, which turned up nine more cases, the CDC and FDA determined that the benefits still outweigh the risks and that the pause should be lifted. A warning was nevertheless added to the vaccine’s fact sheet and the CDC has said that women younger than 50 years old ""especially should be aware"" of the condition and that ""that there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen."" The condition is still rare among the highest-risk group, occurring in around 7 of every million vaccinated adult women below the age of 50.
On July 13, the FDA added warnings to fact sheets on the J&J vaccine about an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
The agency said the chance of developing the syndrome is ""very low"" but advised J&J vaccine recipients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms including weakness or tingling, particularly in the legs or arms; difficulty walking or with facial movement; double vision; or bladder control or bowel function issues.
The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases, with most people reporting symptoms within 42 days of vaccination. One death was reported, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine. The FDA said that each year 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome and most recover fully.
There is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men. In late June, after a review of safety monitoring data, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and the two conditions in teens and young adults.
As of July 12, the agency says there have been 1,047 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years old or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which are through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, are with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and are more common among males and after the second dose.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, the committee said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.""

Full Story
COVID-19 is dangerous: The disease is estimated to have caused more than 579,000 deaths in the U.S. alone, and it can cause lingering health problems for some who get it. The COVID-19 vaccines now authorized for emergency use in the U.S., meanwhile, were found in clinical trials to be safe and effective at preventing symptomatic illness. Nearly 250 million doses have been administered thus far.
But a post circulating online distorts the facts to imply that COVID-19 deaths are inflated by a supposed mandate concerning positive COVID-19 tests. It also baselessly suggests that vaccines are causing deaths that are being ignored.

""Funny isn’t it, if you die within 20 days of testing positive for the Rona (no matter what other factors were involved) You’ll be counted as a COVID death,"" the May 2 tweet reads. ""However, if you drop dead within 24 hours of taking the vaccine it has nothing to do with it.""
One Instagram post of a screenshot of the tweet garnered more than 32,000 likes. Another earned more than 8,000 likes.
But there is no rule that those who ""die within 20 days of testing positive"" for COVID-19 are to be automatically classified as having died from the disease, ""no matter what other factors were involved.""
We’ve previously addressed similar false claims surrounding COVID-19 death certificates and have explained that there is no federal law governing the death certificate process. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does provide guidance on certifying deaths, including some specific to COVID-19.
The CDC specifically advises that ""COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death.""
And there is no evidence that any state or local agencies have such a 20-day rule, either.
It’s possible that COVID-19 could be listed as a contributing factor to — but not the underlying cause of — a death in some cases. But at least 90% of death certificates citing COVID-19 to date list the disease as the underlying cause, or the illness that triggered the chain of events leading to the person’s death, according to CDC data available as of May 5.
It’s worth noting, in the context of the baseless implication that COVID-19 deaths are being systematically misreported, that excess death estimates further reinforce the toll of the pandemic. From March 2020 through the start of 2021, the U.S. experienced about 20% more deaths than would have been expected in the same time period, analyses show. The estimates are higher than the official COVID-19 death toll for that period; excess mortality can also capture indirect effects of the pandemic, such as people who may have died from other causes because they avoided seeking medical attention.
The tweet’s suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines are causing deaths that are not being investigated also doesn’t carry weight.
The U.S. government has several monitoring systems in place to track reports of adverse events — including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Patients and caregivers are asked to report ""any clinically important medical event or health problem that occurs after vaccination"" to VAERS, even if they’re not sure if it was a result of the vaccine.
The CDC and Food and Drug Administration review each case report of deaths that follow vaccination to determine whether they were caused by the vaccine. There has not been an established link for the overwhelming majority of the reports.
The FDA’s fact sheet for health care providers administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine now says that ""a causal relationship"" between the vaccine and rare cases involving both blood clots and low blood platelets ""is plausible"" based on the evidence available. The monitoring systems were used to identify those cases. As of May 4, there were 23 confirmed reports of people developing the condition after receiving the J&J vaccine, and at least three individuals have died. More than 8.4 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered.
Federal officials on April 13 recommended a brief pause on the J&J vaccine while the issue was investigated and, 10 days later, lifted the pause — saying that the ""known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks."" Both the FDA and CDC now include warnings about the rare risk. The CDC says that ""[w]omen younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of this adverse event"" with the J&J vaccine, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are ""available for which this risk has not been seen.""
So health officials do probe reports of adverse events that follow vaccinations, including deaths, contrary to the tweet’s suggestion.

		Quick Take
A viral post falsely attributed to PGA star Bubba Watson criticizes the Black Lives Matter movement and measures taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Watson has said the post ""ain’t from me."" 

Full Story
Facebook posts falsely attribute remarks critical of the Black Lives Matter movement and public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to PGA Tour winner Bubba Watson. This is one of many false claims on social media linking famous people to partisan posts, which we’ve written about before.
An example of the viral post — versions of which began circulating widely on Facebook in the summer — begins: ""HOORAY FOR BUBBA WATSON! He put into words what I think most of us are feeling. Thank you sir! This is from Bubba Watson… pro golfer and a stand up guy."" 
In reference to the protests after George Floyd’s death, the post says, ""I’m so confused right now. I see signs all over saying black lives matter. I’m just trying to figure out which black lives matter."" 
The post also claims social distancing guidelines ""wrecked the economy."" It says, ""Only the experts can understand the data and math. What do you mean other cities/states/governors are interpreting the data differently? Pools are safe in Indiana, but not Michigan? Playgrounds are safe in your town but not mine?""
""Nothing adds up,"" the post continues. ""It’s one gigantic Math life problem, with ever changing denominators that I’m sure the media and politicians are eagerly ready to solve for us…until the next ‘crisis’.""
Watson wrote a Facebook post in July that says: ""I’m not sure how or why my name ended up on the post, but it ain’t from me. I hadn’t seen it until I was asked about it."" 
Also, Facebook posts nearly identical to the bogus post appeared in June without being linked to Watson. 
The two-time Masters Champion has addressed racist symbolism in the past.
In 2012, Watson purchased the ""General Lee,"" the 1969 Dodge Charger made famous on the television show ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" Watson painted an American flag over the Confederate flag on the roof of the car following the June 17, 2015, shooting of nine Black congregants at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Photos surfaced of the gunman with the Confederate flag, prompting the removal of the flag at some sites around the country.
Watson said at the time: ""All my friends, nobody is offended by it, but now with all of the controversy going on, I felt like it was the right thing to do. Make a statement, make a gesture, whatever you want to call it.""

		SciCheck Digest
In a May 16 interview, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director said the agency knew of 223 breakthrough fatalities among fully vaccinated individuals, but ""not all … died of COVID."" That is not an admission that ""many, many hospitals"" previously ""overcounted"" COVID-19 deaths, as conservative websites have reported.

              How lethal is COVID-19?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              It’s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn’t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.
The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the United States as of July 9.
An individual’s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person’s age or health conditions. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is more than 600 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29.

Full Story
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tracking hospitalizations and fatalities for so-called ""COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases.""
The CDC says a breakthrough case occurs when an individual tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — more than two weeks ""after they have completed all recommended doses"" of one of three vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the United States.
In a May 16 interview on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" the CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky,  said the agency so far was aware of 223 deaths among individuals with breakthrough cases of COVID-19.
However, not all of them died from the disease, she told CNN’s Dana Bash.
Bash, May 16: Are you aware of any fully vaccinated individual who has died of COVID-19?
Walensky: We do keep a track of this on our website.
We are asking hospitals and health care facilities to send us cases of what we’re calling breakthrough infections. They occur. They are rare. We are aware of 223, as of May 10, that are among the 115 million people that had been vaccinated by that time.
I also want to convey that now many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in, so not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID. They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack.
Walensky did not provide the exact numbers, but a footnote on the CDC’s webpage at the time said 42 of the 223 fatal cases were ""reported as asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19."" As of May 17, there were 353 fatal cases and 63 were asymptomatic or not related to the disease.


After the interview, The Gateway Pundit, a conservative news website, falsely claimed that Walensky’s remarks amounted to an admission that the CDC’s overall total for deaths from COVID-19 is inflated.
The headline of its May 17 story was ""CDC Director Finally Admits that COVID Cases were Over-Counted in Hospitals – Just as Gateway Pundit and Donald Trump Reported in August.""
""On Sunday CDC Director Rochelle Walensky finally admitted that ‘many, many hospitals’ were counting COVID deaths to include cases that were not COVID deaths,"" the website reported.
A day later, the Conservative Daily Post, following the Gateway Pundit’s lead, also said that ""[t]he CDC admitted that COVID numbers were hugely exaggerated.""
That’s false.
In late August, both the Gateway Pundit and former President Trump promoted a tweet that inaccurately said: ""This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid. That’s 9,210 deaths. The other 94% had 2 to 3 other serious illnesses and the overwhelming majority were of very advanced age.""
But as we later wrote in early September, the fact that the CDC said 6% of the total deaths were solely attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates does not mean the disease was not the leading contributor in the other 94% of the deaths. 
And nothing Walensky said in the CNN interview changes that — or indicates that the Gateway Pundit and Trump were actually ""right,"" as the Gateway Pundit declared.
We’ve noted several times before that COVID-19 often causes other serious conditions that lead to death, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. It can also exacerbate existing illnesses that people already have, such as diabetes or hypertension, which are called comorbidities.
For our article last year, Jeff Lancashire, a spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us that COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause in 92% of those deaths. That means it was the condition that started the chain of events that resulted in someone dying.  
More recently, the CDC said the disease was listed as the underlying cause of death in at least 90% of 574,054 deaths, as of May 19. ""For the remaining deaths, COVID-19 was listed as a contributing cause of death,"" the agency said.
Walensky’s remarks about some people dying with the disease instead of from it — which does happen — also led social media users to claim that the CDC has changed the way deaths from COVID-19 are being reported.
For example, one Instagram user wrote: ""So for anyone who died of anything last year but happened to have Covid, their death was marked as Covid-19. But now, if anyone dies with Covid after being fully vaccinated… but there are other comorbidities… Covid will not be considered the cause of death. Funny how that works. The CDC is an embarrassment.""
But it is simply not the case that ""anyone who died of anything last year but happened to have Covid"" was counted as a COVID-19 death. And the CDC denies that it is now reporting fatalities in breakthrough cases differently.
""As for how CDC is counting COVID-19 deaths, there has been no change,"" Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokesperson, told FactCheck.org in an email.
The CDC says it relies on state and territory health departments to report data on people with breakthrough cases, and the data include hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause, including non-COVID-19 causes.


For a fatal case, the agency asks those health departments to provide a copy of the death certificate ""linked to the case so that a determination could be made if COVID-19 contributed to the cause of death.""
Those death certificates are also how the CDC determines COVID-19 deaths in non-breakthrough cases. And the CDC has long advised physicians, medical examiners and others who are responsible for filling out the documents not to list COVID-19 if the disease played no part in a death.
""I think there has been consistency all along and nothing that Walensky said suggests that they made a change,"" Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told us in a phone interview. 
He said there would be ""huge backlash"" in the medical field if the CDC now tried to change the way it compiles and collects death certificate data.
It all needs to be done in a consistent way to monitor trends, Plescia said.
We have asked the CDC for more details about the reporting of breakthrough cases but so far have not received a response.

      Trump’s False Claims about Pelosi and Chinatown

		President Donald Trump is making false and exaggerated claims about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Feb. 24 trip to San Francisco’s Chinatown. Pelosi urged people to shop and eat there at a time when tourism was suffering because of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year.

Trump falsely tweeted that ""Crazy Nancy Pelosi"" had deleted a video from Twitter of her visit to Chinatown. ""She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA,"" Trump said. But there is no record such a video was ever posted on Twitter by Pelosi.
At an April 13 coronavirus briefing, Trump falsely claimed that during her visit Pelosi said, ""‘Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade.'"" Pelosi didn’t say that. In fact, that parade had taken place on Feb. 8, more than two weeks before Pelosi went to Chinatown.
At a coronavirus briefing on April 15, Trump exaggerated when he said Pelosi ""was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great."" Pelosi didn’t mention parties during her visit, although she urged people to come to Chinatown to shop and eat.
Trump also falsely said Pelosi visited Chinatown ""to show that this thing doesn’t exist,"" referring to the novel coronavirus. Pelosi never suggested that it didn’t exist. She stressed the need for ""prevention, prevention, prevention"" — urging people to be ""concerned and vigilant,"" but not ""afraid.""

The president has raised Pelosi’s visit several times in recent days to counter criticism that he was slow to react to the coronavirus. He repeatedly mentions that he issued travel restrictions on China, which he did on Jan. 31. Meanwhile, he points out, the House speaker was urging people to go to Chinatown.
Trump is mischaracterizing and exaggerating what she said during her visit. And while Trump did issue the travel restrictions, as we have reported, he also downplayed the danger of the virus in a series of remarks and tweets from Jan. 22 to March 10.
The California Democrat’s visit to Chinatown came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the same day as Pelosi’s visit, Trump tweeted, ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!""
Here’s Trump’s April 16 tweet accusing Pelosi of deleting a video from her Twitter account:

Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She’s an incompetent, third-rate politician! pic.twitter.com/uWNI7DCG3o
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2020

We could find no record that the video was ever posted on Pelosi’s Twitter account.
We checked Politwoops, a project of ProPublica that preserves tweets deleted by politicians, and there’s no record Pelosi deleted a tweet of the video, nor a record of her deleting a tweet about the Chinatown visit. The Internet Archives’ Wayback Machine captured an image of Pelosi’s Twitter page on Feb. 27, and that, too, shows no tweet of the video. Pelosi still has a tweet about her Chinatown visit on her Twitter feed.
Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill tweeted that Pelosi’s office hadn’t posted it. ""Fact check: We never posted this video. It’s obviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco….""
Pelosi explained at the time that she was making her Chinatown visit ""to say to everyone: we should come to Chinatown.""
Pelosi, Feb. 24: Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern surrounding tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come. It’s lovely here. The food is delicious, the shops are prospering, the parade was great. Walking tours continue. Please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.
So, Pelosi mentioned the Chinese New Year parade. But she did not say, ""‘Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade,'"" as Trump maintained during the April 13 coronavirus briefing. In fact, the parade occurred on Feb. 8. 
And, while she encouraged people to ""visit and enjoy Chinatown"" and called it ""very safe,"" Trump went too far in saying at his April 15 briefing that Pelosi ""was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great."" Pelosi didn’t mention parties during her visit.
As for the coronavirus, Pelosi didn’t deny its existence — contrary to Trump’s remarks — while visiting Chinatown. She struck a middle ground. ""Prevention, prevention, prevention. We want people to be concerned and vigilant,"" she said. ""However, we don’t want them to be afraid.""
During her excursion, Pelosi was asked if it was irrational for people to stay away from Asian-American-owned businesses in San Francisco and elsewhere.
""Well, that’s one of the reasons we are here today,"" she replied. ""It doesn’t make any sense, but it’s not just Asian-owned now. You see in Italy where the shows – the fashion shows and all of that were done without an audience because people – they just didn’t – because people were not coming. So, again, this fear is – I think – unwarranted in light of the precautions that are being taken here in the United States.""
But in response to a question, Pelosi rejected the notion that racism was the reason people were avoiding Asian businesses.
""I don’t know that,"" she said. ""But, I do think that because it started in China, there’s a concern that are the – is the Chinese government doing what it needed to do early enough, and now as we go forward. But that should not be carried over to Chinatown and San Francisco.""
Asked whether she felt the federal government was doing enough to control the virus, Pelosi said, ""I have confidence in Dr. [Anthony] Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, who has even further confidence in what we’re doing.""
Trump and Pelosi have long had a frosty relationship, one that wasn’t warmed up by the impeachment battle. And the president has bristled at her criticism that he was slow to react to the threat of the novel coronavirus. On March 29, on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" she said, ""his denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where — it continues — his delay in getting equipment to where it’s needed is deadly.""
Trump returned fire the following day in an interview on Fox News’ ""Fox & Friends,"" assailing Pelosi as a ""sick puppy.""
To sum up: Pelosi did visit Chinatown in late February in an effort to encourage people to go there to eat and shop. But she did not support parades or parties, try to show the coronavirus didn’t exist or delete a tweet of her visit, as Trump claimed.

		Summary
It was another unconventional night for fact-checkers at the truncated Democratic National Convention that has been forced to go virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic.
But we found a few statements to write about, including a misleading claim about the U.S. unemployment rate and auto industry bailout claims that don’t tell the whole story.
Analysis
On the night the Democratic Party formally nominated former Vice President Joe Biden as the party’s 2020 presidential nominee, two former U.S. presidents spoke — Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.
Clinton’s Misleading and Meaningless Unemployment Claim
Clinton, who uncharacteristically spoke for less than five minutes, made a misleading claim when he said that the U.S. is ""the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple"" because of President Donald Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s true that the unemployment rates listed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.S. jobless rate nearly tripling between January and the most recent month on record. The next-largest increase was a near-doubling of the rate in Canada.
But his comparison is meaningless — rather like comparing apples to kumquats. That’s because the U.S. counts a laid-off worker as ""unemployed"" even if the layoff is expected to be temporary — while many others do not. In July, those on ""temporary layoff"" accounted for 56% of all those counted as ""unemployed"" in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Clinton referred specifically to one of the countries that doesn’t include those temporarily laid off in their count of the jobless, saying the U.S. rate is ""two and a half times the United Kingdom’s.""
It’s true that the U.K. Office for National Statistics currently lists its unemployment rate as only 3.9% compared with the U.S. rate of 10.2%. But, unlike the U.S., the U.K. doesn’t count those on temporary layoff as unemployed.
U.K. Office for National Statistics, August: Workers furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme … have a reasonable expectation of returning to their jobs after a temporary period of absence. Therefore they are classified as employed.
And that’s not the only factor making Clinton’s comparison misleading. Other countries — such as Germany — have met the COVID-19 crisis by subsidizing employers to keep workers on the payroll even when there is less work to do. In the U.S., the main approach has been to increase benefits paid to laid-off workers through unemployment insurance.
The OECD Employment Outlook 2020, which was released in July, notes that the U.S. has had a far higher unemployment rate during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with other OECD countries, saying the difference in rates ""reflects fundamental differences in countries’ policy mix to cushion the economic and social effects of the crisis.""
""The United States are strongly relying on unemployment insurance benefits to secure the income of workers who lose their jobs, even in the case of a temporary crisis,"" the report said. ""Meanwhile, other OECD countries, not just in Europe, are making heavy use of job retention schemes, which allow companies to cut hours of work, or even halt work entirely, while keeping their workers attached.""
Auto Bailout
Michigan lawmakers praised Biden for his role in helping to rescue the auto industry after the Great Recession. It’s worth noting that while this remains a signature accomplishment of the Obama administration, the effort began under former President George W. Bush.
In a keynote address featuring several young Democratic politicians, Michigan state Rep. Mari Manoogian said: ""When the auto industry was going under, Joe stuck his neck out to protect it and helped save 1.5 million auto jobs."" Later, during the roll call of the states, Michigan U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said, ""Michigan auto workers are the best in the world. But we’d be nowhere without Joe Biden. And a lot of folks wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt. But Joe Biden believed in us, and together we fought to save our auto industry.""
As we’ve explained before, the auto industry effort began on Dec. 19, 2008, when then-President Bush announced that his administration would provide General Motors and Chrysler with $13.4 billion in loans under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, with another $4 billion to GM to come once Congress approved releasing the second half of the TARP money. The money came with strings, most notably the requirement that the automakers come up with a long-term viability plan by March 31, 2009.
Fast-forward to March 30, 2009, when then-President Barack Obama rejected the companies’ viability plans, but then announced a bankruptcy plan for Chrysler on April 30 and a GM bankruptcy plan on June 1. Those plans allowed the automakers to restructure and get more federal aid.
In the end, the Treasury Department invested about $80 billion in the industry and recouped most of it. Treasury says the rescue of the industry ended up costing the government $9.3 billion.
As for Manoogian’s claim that Biden ""helped save 1.5 million auto jobs,"" that’s backed up by an estimate from the Center for Automotive Research. The group’s 2013 report said the auto bailout saved 1.5 million jobs in 2010, including those at GM, Chrysler, auto suppliers and ""spin-off employment losses"" due to ""reduced spending in the U.S. economy.""
The report credited both the Bush and Obama administrations.
""Two consecutive executive administrations in Washington decided in late 2008 and early 2009 that the consequences of the potential losses and outcomes to the U.S. economy and people described above were worth avoiding through a federal intervention,"" the report said. ""CAR is confident that in the years ahead, this peacetime intervention in the private sector by the U.S. government will be seen as one of the most successful in U.S. economic history.""
Trump and the New Hoax
In welcoming viewers to the second night of the convention, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said of the Democrats, ""Unlike the president, we’ve never called COVID-19 a hoax."" As we have written, it is true that Trump said the novel coronavirus was the Democrats’ ""new hoax."" But the president has said he was talking about the Democrats’ criticism of how he had handled the pandemic, not the disease itself.
At a political rally on Feb. 28 in South Carolina, Trump said, ""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue.""
Then the president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation as a hoax, made his ""new hoax"" remark.
Trump, Feb. 28: One of my people came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia."" That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. 
Democrats quickly seized on the remark. Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, described the president’s comments as ""absolutely bizarre.""
""Look, this is a serious, serious problem,"" Biden told MSNBC on Feb. 29. ""It’s able to be solved, but it requires us to be absolutely level-headed and let the scientists have the lead in all of this. But for him to start talking about it being a hoax is absolutely dangerous. It’s just not a decent way to act.""
In the wake of the criticism, Trump said at a press conference on Feb. 29 that he used the term ""hoax"" to refer not to the coronavirus itself but to Democrats’ criticism of how his administration had responded to it.
Asked if he regretted using that particular word, he replied: ""No, no, no. ‘Hoax’ referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not — I’m not talking about what’s happening here; I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.""

      No Evidence That Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19

		Quick Take
A claim being pushed on social media and by an organization skeptical of vaccines is using a military study to falsely suggest that the flu vaccine increases someone’s risk of contracting COVID-19. The study does not say that, and the Military Health System advises people to get the flu shot.

Full Story 
Federal health officials are warning that the novel coronavirus outbreak could resurge in the fall, presenting a significant public health quandary: fighting both COVID-19 and the flu at the same time.
Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted the importance of the flu vaccine in controlling the spread of influenza in a recent interview with the Washington Post. He said the flu shot ""may allow there to be a hospital bed available for your mother or grandmother that may get coronavirus.""
But social media posts are singing a different tune, cautioning against the flu shot by falsely suggesting that the vaccine increases the chances of getting COVID-19 by ""36%.""
The argument is being pushed in a post by Children’s Health Defense — an organization founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism — headlined ""Pentagon Study: Flu Shot Raises Risk of Coronavirus by 36% (and Other Supporting Studies)."" The post, republished elsewhere, pointed to ""peer-reviewed, published studies"" to ""prove"" that advice offered by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper in March for people to get the flu shot ""may have been the worst advice he could have given the public.""
That’s wrong.
First of all, experts say there has been no study connecting the flu shot with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
The central study cited by the Children’s Health Defense is a 2019 Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch study that probed the theory that ""influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses"" — a concept known as ""virus interference.""
Edward Belongia, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told us that the theory rests on the idea that ""if you get a flu infection, for example, maybe for some period of time your immune response to that flu infection reduces your risk of getting infected by some other virus."" 
Belongia said virus interference has been the subject of speculation and some studies with mixed results, but there is ultimately little data to support it. A 2013 study he worked on, cited in the AFHSB study, found that ""influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.""
In fact, the AFHSB study concluded that its ""overall results … showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination.""
The erroneous claim that the study shows a heightened risk for COVID-19 for those vaccinated for the flu hinges on the study’s suggestion that vaccinated individuals appeared more likely to get ""coronavirus.""
But the study looked at four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2.
What’s more, Belongia said, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person has an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone’s chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they’ve been vaccinated for the flu.
Different viruses affect different age groups and circulate at different times, he said. ""It can be easily explained just by random variation and the fact that they didn’t adjust for confounding variables.""
The Military Health System, of which the AFHSB is a part, noted in a statement to FactCheck.org that the study used data collected two years before the emergence of COVID-19 and looked at the seasonal coronaviruses — ""impacting children and adults with no serious complications"" — which ""do not have the potential for epidemic or pandemic spread.""
""The study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19,"" the MHS said.
Furthermore, the statement said, ""it’s also important to note the study found evidence of significant protection by influenza vaccination against not only multiple forms of the flu, but other, very serious non-influenza viruses, such as parainfluenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and non-influenza virus coinfections. It remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.""
There have been some results suggestive of virus interference, which the Children’s Health Defense cites in its post. But none of the studies referenced assessed risks of the flu shot when it comes to COVID-19.
For example, Sharon Rikin, an assistant professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, said in an email that a 2018 study she worked on ""showed an association with flu vaccination and a slightly higher risk of non-flu acute respiratory infections (such as the common cold) in children. However, this association was not seen in adults.""
""In medicine, we are always weighing the risks and benefits of treatments. In this case, we know that the flu vaccine is safe and effective to reduce illness and death among children and adults every year,"" Rikin added. ""We have not studied the association between flu vaccination and risk of COVID-19. Fortunately, COVID-19 is typically not causing significant illness in children. However, preventing illness and death from flu still remains extremely important for children.""
Rikin said ""just because we found an association between flu vaccines and acute respiratory infections does not mean that the flu vaccine actually caused there to be a higher risk of infections."" She said the group struggled to find a ""biologically plausible explanation"" and that while ""there is a small body of literature that hypothesizes that the phenomenon of shifts in viral prevalence could be caused by viral interference,"" there is not ""strong empirical evidence of this occurring.""
Belongia told us that, ultimately, the evidence of virus interference through such studies ""is weak and inconclusive.""
""Overall, we do not see evidence of virus interference that is sufficient to raise concerns about flu vaccination and COVID-19 risk,"" he said. ""Serious COVID-19 disease occurs primarily in adults, and we do not have evidence of flu vaccine causing virus interference in adult age groups.""
He said that getting the flu shot, if anything, is especially important because of potential problems posed by the combination of the flu and COVID-19, both for the health care system and individuals.
Likewise, Richard Ellison, a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and hospital epidemiologist at UMass Memorial Medical Center, told us in an email that ""getting the flu itself carries very significant morbidity and potentially mortality — so we don’t want someone to get the flu in the first place.""
""In addition, while having the flu may boost the immune system, it can significantly weaken someone’s overall health status, and make them more susceptible to complications should they be unfortunate enough to have both influenza and COVID-19 in the same year.""
Update, April 27: We removed a reference to a 2017 study, which was cited by the Children’s Health Defense, and a quote from one of its authors, because the study’s methodology and veracity have been disputed.

A businessman’s post on Instagram and Facebook wrongly claims that the U.S. government ""changed the definition of pandemic"" in 2004, suggesting that COVID-19 would not have qualified under the old definition. There’s no evidence for those claims — and COVID-19 is by all means a pandemic.

              It’s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn’t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.
The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the United States as of July 9.
An individual’s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person’s age or health conditions. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is more than 600 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29.

Full Story
More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease has caused a reported 4 million deaths around the world, including more than 600,000 in the United States. But false and misleading claims casting doubt on the seriousness of the disease remain unrelenting.
A businessman with nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram recently took to social media to erroneously claim that the U.S. government previously changed the definition of ""pandemic"" — and suggest that, under the supposed old definition, COVID-19 would not have been considered a pandemic.
But that’s wrong for several reasons.
Dave Asprey, who founded the coffee and nutrition company Bulletproof, begins the caption of the post by accusing ""the media"" of creating a ""storm about the latest health scare"" every ""3-4 years,"" arguing that diseases are hyped up for financial reasons, including pharmaceutical company profits.
The image with the post includes a timeline of various disease outbreaks since 1986, and is labeled ""The pandemic business model"" — even though most of the outbreaks included were not declared pandemics. Of the nine infectious disease events referenced, only two were deemed pandemics: COVID-19 and the 2009 H1N1 ""swine flu.""

""It’s such a big business that in 2004, US agencies seeking more funding changed the definition of pandemic from ‘rapidly spreading infection that kills a lot of people’ to ‘rapidly spreading infection,'"" the caption of the post continues.
The post, which received more than 12,000 likes and was also repeated on Asprey’s Facebook page, goes on to claim, among other things, that ""[y]es, the death rate is higher than normal, but nowhere near what would have made the cut before they changed the definition.""
But there’s no evidence to support the claim that ""US agencies seeking more funding changed the definition of pandemic.""
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes a pandemic as an ""epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people."" (The same page describes an epidemic as ""an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area."")
Similarly, A Dictionary of Epidemiology, as Vox pointed out last year, defines a pandemic as ""an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.""
COVID-19 — with more than 191 million cases reported to date in countries around the world — no doubt meets that general definition of global spread of a disease.
In 2004, the year referenced by Asprey, Congress did pass the Project BioShield Act. The law — intended to help the U.S. prepare against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats — allowed the government to guarantee the purchase of countermeasures (such as vaccines) in order to help facilitate their development. It also permitted the Food and Drug Administration to issue emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, for drugs and medical products during public health emergencies; the COVID-19 vaccines being used in the U.S. have been given EUAs.
But the law did not proffer — or revise — a definition for ""pandemic."" Nor was any definition laid out in the 2006 Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act.
While there has been some grappling over the years about the precise definition of pandemic — and how severity of a disease should be considered in declaring one — multiple experts told us they had not heard of the U.S. government changing some official definition of the word for the sake of funding, as Asprey alleges.
Frank Snowden, a professor of history and the history of medicine at Yale University, instead noted to us that there was some debate over a change that the World Health Organization made — in 2009, not 2004 — to a webpage offering a definition for ""influenza pandemic.""
That page described an influenza pandemic as occurring ""when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity, resulting in epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness.""
In early May 2009, not long before the H1N1 pandemic was declared, the WHO revised that page — removing the reference to a pandemic causing ""enormous numbers of deaths and illness."" By May 9, 2009, for example, the same page had been changed to say: ""A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic of a disease. An influenza pandemic may occur when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity.""
That change spoke to the fact that there was not a universally accepted definition of ""pandemic,"" as a New York Times column documented.
Some criticized the change on the website and argued that H1N1 should not have been labeled a pandemic. But WHO maintained that the change on the website did not affect the H1N1 pandemic declaration, since there were then established phases in place for declaring a pandemic. WHO no longer uses that system.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, co-authored a piece published in October 2009 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases highlighting how there was not a single accepted definition of pandemic.
The authors wrote that there were common traits in previously described pandemics — such as wide geographic extension; disease movement (or ""spread via transmission that can be traced from place to place""); and high attack rates and explosiveness (multiple cases occurring in short periods of time).
""There seems to be only 1 invariable common denominator: widespread geographic extension,"" they concluded.
In terms of COVID-19, WHO officials were reportedly slow to adopt the word ""pandemic."" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in late February 2020 that the decision on whether to declare the disease a pandemic would be based on ""an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole of society.""
On March 11, 2020 — citing the rapid increase in cases of COVID-19, its spread across more than 100 countries, and by then thousands dead — Ghebreyesus said WHO ""made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic."" Two days later, then-President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency.
We sent questions about Asprey’s claims to his company, but we didn’t hear back.
His suggestion that the COVID-19 death rate is ""nowhere near what would have made the cut before they changed the definition"" is equally dubious. Even the old description of ""influenza pandemic"" on the WHO website was vague in including the qualification of ""enormous numbers of deaths and illness."" 
It’s hard to know exactly how lethal COVID-19 is, as we’ve explained. As the WHO has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. But the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed. The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the U.S., as of July 9.
And as we noted earlier, the disease — because it has spread so widely — has caused more than 4 million deaths worldwide.
""No matter what definition you want to use, COVID-19 is a pandemic,"" Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, told us in an email.

		A new Trump campaign ad claims that President Donald Trump took ""fast action"" in regard to testing for the novel coronavirus. While ""fast action"" is subjective, pandemic experts say the U.S. did not move quickly to set up an adequate system and in fact lagged behind other countries.
We have reported several times on a number of snags and miscues that prevented robust, widespread early testing.
""The United States has lagged nearly every developed country in ramping up testing, and the slow action is one reason why we have the worst epidemic in the world and are discussing reopening when it is not safe to do so, while other countries have used testing as a centerpiece of their strategy to reduce cases to a point where reopening is much more appropriate,"" Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email. ""The lack of testing has been not only a public health catastrophe in the US, but also is a direct cause of our economic suffering.""
Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in an email: ""We need only look at other countries (like South Korea, Germany, Singapore, New Zealand and others) to see what rapid testing and identification can do to slow down spread of this virus. South Korea had done 150,000 tests before we had done 500. The fact that we have more deaths per million in the population than many other developed countries is a testament to our slow response to this virus.""
The new 30-second ad, called ""Tough Steps,"" first aired May 5 in Indiana. The Trump campaign has spent more than $200,000 on the ad so far, according to Advertising Analytics.

The ad also includes a number of false and unsubstantiated claims that Trump has made before.
It says he ""banned Chinese and European travel to the U.S."" While Trump did impose restrictions, as we have reported, they included exceptions, so they weren’t actual ""bans."" For example, the New York Times reported that nearly 40,000 people flew directly from China to the U.S. in the two months after the China restrictions went into effect on Feb. 2.
The ad suggests that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden used the term ""xenophobia"" in connection with the president’s travel restrictions. But it’s not clear that he did.
On the day the China restrictions were announced, as we have written, Biden did say at a campaign event in Iowa, ""This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science."" But Biden didn’t refer to the travel restrictions in his speech, and the Biden campaign says the candidate was referring to Trump’s penchant for scapegoating, not the travel rules. 
On April 3, the Biden campaign said that he supported the restrictions. 
The ad also suggests that ""President Trump saved countless lives"" as a result of the travel restrictions. As we have written, in at least two coronavirus task force briefings, the president, without evidence, claimed that the travel restrictions he implemented on China ""saved tens of thousands"" and even ""hundreds of thousands of lives."" We found no support for such figures, and the White House didn’t provide any.
The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had a modest impact, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic.
We have written on a number of occasions about the problems slowing down the nation’s coronavirus testing efforts. The first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S. was confirmed on Jan. 20.
In the early stages of the pandemic, testing was in the hands of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Problems arose after Feb. 5, when the CDC began shipping its kits out to qualified state and local public health labs in an effort to expand testing. The agency said it was releasing 200 kits — each capable of testing around 700 to 800 specimens — giving labs just one kit each. But by Feb. 12, the CDC told reporters that some labs had experienced problems when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked.
For a while, the agency promised to remake the faulty component and distribute that to the public health labs and, in the meantime, asked any lab that had difficulties to send samples into the CDC for testing. As a result, as of Feb. 25, only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing.
More than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC said it had come up with a fix.
Another problem early on stemmed from the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested. At first, the CDC recommended testing only those with a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and who had traveled to Wuhan, China, where the disease started, or had contact with someone suspected of having the disease.
In late February, after a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC changed its guidelines to include anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test. The CDC updated its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians ""should use their judgment"" in deciding who should be tested.
Another problem stemmed from the CDC’s role early on as the sole player in the testing game.
As we have written, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several former officials said that the CDC simply isn’t set up to be a commercial test lab, let alone the only test lab for the country in such a pandemic. It was a month after the Trump administration on Jan. 31 declared a public health emergency that it took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability. 
Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration, wrote, ""A series of errors with lab testing delayed the U.S. response to the Covid-19 pandemic."" Besides the CDC test kit problems, he wrote, ""the Food and Drug Administration was slow to allow hospital labs to develop their own tests; and the Department of Health and Human Services didn’t work with commercial labs to start developing broadly available private sector tests until far too late.""
On March 6, six weeks after the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the U.S., Trump famously declared that anyone who ""wants a test can get a test."" Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a television interview the same day that there ""is no testing kit shortage, nor has there ever been.""
But that wasn’t the case. On March 9, we were told by the Association of Public Health Laboratories that although things were improving, ""demand for testing is greater than the tests available.""
On March 12, at a congressional hearing, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asked who was in charge of ""making sure … as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible."" Fauci responded, ""The system — the system does not — is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing. … The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.""
So seven weeks after the first case of COVID-19 surfaced in the U.S., there remained a ""failing"" in the nation’s testing system — contrary to the ad’s claim of ""fast action.""

      Trump Campaign Aide’s Dubious Claim on Protecting the President

		A senior adviser to President Donald Trump’s campaign made the dubious claim that Trump was ""probably the most protected person on Earth,"" because his visitors ""must submit to a COVID test"" and ""people don’t physically get close"" to him.
But experts say the White House testing strategy was insufficient to protect the president, and White House photos show a maskless Trump in close contact with others.
Epidemiologists warn that while rigorous testing procedures can help identify cases and reduce the risk of an outbreak, they do not ensure that someone will not get infected. Particularly in the early days after an infection, tests may show a negative result even if someone is infectious. And no test is 100% accurate. Other mitigation protocols, such as wearing face masks and social distancing, are still needed.
Also, photos posted in recent weeks on the official White House Flickr account show Trump in close contact with numerous people, often with neither the president nor others wearing masks.
Trump revealed in the early morning hours of Oct. 2 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. After experiencing fever and being given supplemental oxygen treatment, Trump spent three days getting treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center before being discharged to the White House on Oct. 5.
On ""Fox News Sunday,"" host Chris Wallace asked senior campaign adviser Steve Cortes about a lack of social distancing at the White House. Wallace showed Cortes a photo of the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event officially announcing the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, with seven people circled who have since tested positive for COVID-19.
""Question, Steve, people packed together, the vast majority not wearing masks, how does that make sense?"" Wallace asked.
Cortes, Oct. 4: Tremendous precautions are taken to protect the president, as you well know. Anybody who goes to see the president must submit to a COVID test first and also there is significant distancing. People don’t physically get close to the president, at least people who don’t have to.
Of course his family members, some of the security detail, that’s a different story, but I think given these precautions and given that he is probably the most protected person on Earth, the fact that he still got infected shows us that unfortunately this virus has that kind of power, that kind of communicable ability. And the president though, and he’s made this clear, he was unwilling to completely sequester himself to take no risk because leaders take risks and he is the servant of the people as well as the commander-in-chief so he said he must be around the people he serves.
But the evidence shows there were flaws in what Cortes called the ""tremendous precautions"" taken to protect the president.
Testing Strategy Insufficient
On April 3, the White House announced that anyone in ""close proximity"" to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence would be tested.
But as Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina explained in an Oct. 2 press call (starting around the 13:45 mark), while testing can be effective in stopping the onward spread from someone who has tested positive, ""Testing will never stop somebody from getting the virus. To stop yourself from getting the virus, you need to not come in contact with the virus or you need to protect yourself through wearing a mask if you are in contact with the virus. And obviously I would say the president hasn’t been particularly good at doing that.""
As we’ve written before, there are inherent limitations in diagnostic tests. Even if someone tests negative, that doesn’t necessarily mean that a person isn’t infected — only that the test didn’t detect the presence of the virus at that specific time.
Given that it can take a few days or even longer for the virus to become detectable, a negative result means someone still could be infectious and other public health measures should still be taken.
The White House was reportedly using Abbot’s ID NOW test as a rapid test for screening staff. The test is a molecular test that looks for the viral genome in a nasal swab sample, but is faster and less sensitive than the standard PCR tests.
Mina said that the test was very good — perhaps the best rapid test available. But no test is perfect, and the test is not actually designed to be used the way the White House deployed it.
The FDA’s emergency use authorization was revised in mid-September to specify that testing is intended to be ""from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider within the first seven days of the onset of symptoms."" In other words, the test is meant for those who have symptoms, not for surveillance.
""If you told me that somebody who was only testing, not wearing their mask, not distancing, and not taking every other precautionary measure tested positive,"" Saskia Popescu, a University of Arizona epidemiology professor and biodefense expert, told STAT News, ""I would say: ‘no shit, Sherlock.’""
Trump Not Socially Distancing in Photos
Although Cortes claimed there is ""significant distancing"" and that, ""People don’t physically get close to the president,"" numerous photos posted on the official White House Flickr account over the last several weeks show that Trump was regularly in close contact with people, often while neither the president nor others wore masks.
Here is Trump with Barrett and her family in the Oval Office on Sept. 26. Nobody is wearing masks:

Here is Trump the next day at an East Room reception for Gold Star families on Sept. 27. No one seated in the audience at the indoor reception is wearing masks:

Here is Trump standing a couple of feet away from Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns at an event on the South Lawn on Sept. 28, elbow to elbow inspecting a pickup truck:

The president here is signing a hat for a supporter in a wheelchair at the Duke Energy Hangar in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Sept. 24. The supporters are wearing masks; Trump is not:

Trump is seated with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on one side and Vice President Pence on the other on Aug. 20 in a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of Iraq:

Here, Trump speaks with White House staff and guests at the South Portico of the White House on Sept. 24, prior to boarding Marine One:

On Sept. 23, Trump meets in the Cabinet Room of the White House with states attorneys general on protecting consumers from social media abuse:

Trump speaks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a bilateral meeting on Sept. 15 in the Oval Office:

Trump signs the Abraham Accords on Sept. 15 with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bahrain Dr. Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. U.S. Chief of Protocol Cam Henderson assists Trump:

Even after learning that Hope Hicks, a senior adviser to Trump, had tested positive for COVID-19, Trump went to a fundraising event at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
""Hope Hicks, we discovered (her positive test) as Marine One was taking off yesterday [for Bedminster],"" White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Oct. 2. ""We pulled some of the people traveling in close contact.""
Trump acknowledged that Hicks is someone he and the first lady ""spend a lot of time with,"" and according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, people who come into contact with someone sick with COVID-19 should quarantine for 14 days, ""even if you test negative for COVID-19 or feel healthy.""
""It was deemed safe for the president to go,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. ""He socially distanced, it was an outdoor event and it was deemed safe by White House operations.""
That’s not entirely accurate. While the fundraising event attended by about 100 large-dollar donors was held outdoors, and several attendees told ABC News the president socially distanced and everyone wore masks, there was also a campaign ""roundtable"" held in an enclosed tent. According to one attendee, the roundtable event was attended by about 19 people, none wearing masks, though the president sat at a table about 10 feet away from anyone else.
However, the latest information from the CDC dispels the idea that people are necessarily safe if they keep a 6-foot distance, particularly if they are indoors.
""Some infections can be spread by exposure to virus in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours,"" the CDC states. ""These viruses may be able to infect people who are further than 6 feet away from the person who is infected or after that person has left the space.""
The CDC says that while it is much more common for the virus to spread through close contact, it can also spread through airborne transmission.
""There is evidence that under certain conditions, people with COVID-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away,"" the CDC states.
According to the Wall Street Journal, after his return from New Jersey, Trump took a rapid COVID-19 test, and tested positive. But he did not disclose that in a subsequent phone interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, saying only that he ""just went out for a test"" — a more thorough screening than a rapid test — and had not yet gotten back results.
Trump said he was tested because, ""I spend a lot of time with Hope, and so does the first lady.""
And he discussed how difficult it can be to social distance.
""You know, it’s very hard,"" Trump said. ""When you’re with soldiers, when you’re with airmen, when you’re with Marines, and I’m with — and the police officers. I’m with them so much. And when they come over here, it’s very hard to say, stay back, stay back. It’s a tough kind of a situation. It’s a terrible thing. So, I just went for a test, and we will see what happens. I mean, who knows?""
In an interview on the Fox Business Network on Oct. 5, Trump coronavirus adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, acknowledged that Trump has not always followed the social distancing guidelines.
""He wants to talk to people,"" Atlas said. ""He needs to be with people. He can’t afford to be … he uses mitigations — hand washing, social distancing, masks when necessary. But the reality is, he’s not going to be able to social distance from the American people all the time. He can’t always do that. And so, we do our best to protect him. Everybody does their best at protecting the White House’s special environment.""
Upon his return to the White House from the hospital, Trump walked to the balcony above the South Lawn, removed his mask, put it in his pocket and posed for photographers for two minutes.

		Quick Take
Facebook posts credit President Donald Trump with accomplishing a list of things that haven’t happened — claiming, for example, that he ""cancelled"" a proposed House bill on contact tracing and ""expelled WHO.""


Full Story 
Popular text posts circulating on Facebook, in some cases with explicit references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, are falsely claiming that President Donald Trump has accomplished things that haven’t actually happened.
""In just a couple of days, Donald Trump did what many of us expected and knew would happen,"" the posts claim, proceeding to a list of six purported actions by the president.
But most of the claims are false, misleading or unsupported. Others require a bit more context. We’ll break them down here.

Claim: Trump ""Cancelled the Democrats HR 6666 bill, known as the Covid 19 TRACE Act that was the basis for Bill Gates’s diagnosis and tracking project, which was also cancelled.""

First of all, there’s no evidence that H.R. 6666 — the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act — is a ""basis"" for a purported ""tracking project"" by Bill Gates. The bill outlines a $100 billion fund to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to fund contact tracing efforts across the country, as we’ve previously explained.
Secondly, the president doesn’t have the power to ""cancel"" a bill. Instead, he could veto a piece of legislation if it were to come to his desk.
But the bill in question is far from that step: H.R. 6666 is currently before a House committee. It would need to advance to the House floor and be passed by that chamber, as well as by the Republican-led Senate, before it would go to Trump.

Claim: Trump ""Cancelled Bill Gates project known as ID2020.""

ID2020 is the name of a nonprofit organization with a mission to widen access to digital forms of identification — and to ensure people have control over their ""digital IDs."" For example, it has partnered with iRespond and the International Rescue Committee on a program to ""offer a digital identity platform"" to refugees at a camp in Thailand that would allow them ""to not only access improved healthcare services but also securely store educational and professional credentials.""
The organization was founded by several partners — including Microsoft, of which Gates is co-founder, and by Gavi, a Gates-backed organization that seeks to provide access to vaccines in impoverished countries.
In recent months, ID2020 has been the subject of conspiracy theories.
We’ve previously written about a false claim that Gates has proposed tracking people with microchips. Some have evidently linked such baseless claims also to ID2020. As Snopes reports, those claims misrepresent ID2020’s projects.
The notion that a Gates project was ""cancelled"" may be a reference to an at-home testing initiative for the novel coronavirus, backed by Gates, that was taking place in the Seattle area. The Food and Drug Administration recently ordered the project to temporarily halt its effort until additional approvals were granted; but it hasn’t been permanently canceled.
That project — the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network — wrote on its website on May 14 that ""SCAN’s test is authorized by the Washington State Department of Health. However, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recently clarified its guidance for home-based, self-collected samples to test for COVID-19.""
""We have been notified that a separate federal emergency use authorization (EUA) is required to return results for self-collected tests,"" the statement says. ""The FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN’s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.""

Claim: Trump ""will not allow vaccines to be mandatory.""

There’s no evidence Trump has taken any recent action to mandate, or bar the mandate of, vaccines. Right now, there are some vaccine mandates under state laws, as we’ll explain.
This claim might be a reference to a statement Trump made on May 15 while discussing ""Operation Warp Speed"" — a federal initiative to quickly find a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19.
""We’re looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it,"" Trump said while answering a reporter’s question. ""Not everybody is going to want to get it.""
Trump has in the past, and recently, expressed reticence toward the flu shot — which the CDC credits with saving thousands of lives each year. But he has also recently signaled support for vaccines; in particular, he’s supported the rapid development of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.
The objective of Operation Warp Speed ""is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible,"" Trump said. ""Again, we’d love to see if we could do it prior to the end of the year.""
He also said the federal government would ""invest in manufacturing all of the top vaccine candidates before they’re approved,"" which would ""eliminate any unnecessary delay and enable us to begin providing Americans with a proven vaccine the day our scientists say, ‘We’re ready. We got it.'""
Currently, state laws mandate certain vaccination requirements for students, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Conference on State Legislatures.
""State laws establish vaccination requirements for school children. These laws often apply not only to children attending public schools but also to those attending private schools and day care facilities,"" the CDC says. ""All states provide medical exemptions, and some state laws also offer exemptions for religious and/or philosophical reasons. State laws also establish mechanisms for enforcement of school vaccination requirements and exemptions.""
According to the Congressional Research Service, in addition to states wielding the power to mandate vaccines in order to protect their populations, there are some powers that could permit the federal government to mandate vaccination to prevent the spread of communicable diseases into the U.S. or between states.
""It is possible for either state or federal government to mandate vaccination,"" said Nicole Huberfeld, a Boston University professor of health law, ethics and human rights, but ""usually vaccination is a state law matter.""
""States require children to be vaccinated to enter public schools, with physician proof of vaccination being required (or proof of medical condition exemption, alternatively),"" Huberfeld said in an email. ""Some states allow more than medical exemptions, they have gone so far as to allow religious and even ‘moral’ objections to vaccine … Neither religious nor moral exemptions are constitutionally required.""
But, she added, ""because the Constitution protects the individual right to refuse medical treatment, it would take a very serious event to create a situation where absolute mandatory vaccination would be the law of a state (or the nation). Trump certainly has not mandated vaccination, though he has touted it as a way out of the pandemic.""

Claim: Trump ""Expelled WHO.""

The World Health Organization is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, though there are regional offices, including one in Washington, D.C.
This claim appears to be a misrepresentation of recent actions against the WHO taken by Trump.
In April, Trump — who has accused the WHO of mismanaging the COVID-19 outbreak — announced that he would suspend U.S. payments to the organization.
And on May 18, Trump sent a letter to the organization and demanded that it commit to ""major substantive improvements"" in the next 30 days. If it didn’t, Trump said in the letter, ""I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization.""

Claim: Trump opened ""a platform to report censorship on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.""

The White House did create a tool for Americans to file claims of what they believe to be censorship on social media platforms — in 2019. The tool was announced in May 2019 and instructed users that it was for ""information gathering only.""
The web page now says it ""isn’t accepting new responses."" Trump has continued to talk about the issue, though.
""The Radical Left is in total command & control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google,"" he wrote on Twitter on May 16. ""The Administration is working to remedy this illegal situation. Stay tuned, and send names & events.""

Claim: Trump ""gave the final hit to Chinese 5 G and therefore the Chinese government.""

This is likely a reference to a recent move by the Trump administration to further cut off supplies to Huawei, a Chinese tech giant rolling out 5G networks. The U.S. has accused the company of conspiring to steal trade secrets and said its technology could be used for Chinese espionage. Huawei has denied this.
On May 15, the Trump administration announced measures designed to prevent foreign companies that use U.S. software and technology from providing chips to the company.
Those sanctions could delay the rollout of the company’s 5G technology, its chief technology officer told Yahoo Finance.
Still, some experts told the Wall Street Journal that loopholes remain that may allow supplies to flow to the company in more indirect ways.

		A Trump campaign ad uses a clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci praising federal public health officials — saying that he ""can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more"" — and makes it seem like Fauci was personally complimenting the president. Fauci himself says the ad lifted his words ""out of context.""
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has at times been critical when President Donald Trump has strayed from the guidance of public health officials. For example, Fauci has criticized some states for opening too quickly per Trump’s encouragement. He has also criticized the president’s mixed messages on wearing masks, and his insistence on holding large, densely packed rallies.
The new Trump ad begins with images of a masked Trump leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and returning to the White House, as the narrator says: ""President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus and so is America.""
The narrator later says, ""President Trump tackled the virus head-on, as leaders should."" It then immediately cuts to a clip of Fauci on camera saying, ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more.""

Fauci’s comment came in an interview with Fox News host Mark Levin in late March.


Levin, March 23: Dr. Fauci, let me ask you a question. You’ve been doing this a long time. Have you ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat, a health threat?
Fauci: Well, we’ve never had a threat like this and the coordinated response has been, there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think, is one of them. I mean, we’re talking about all hands on deck, is that I, as one of many people on a team, I’m not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was, I have been devoting almost full time on this, almost full-time.
I’m down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. I’m connected by phone throughout the day and into the night. When I say night, I’m talking 12, 1, 2 in the morning. I’m not the only one. There’s a whole group of us that are doing that. It’s every single day. So I can’t imagine that under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously we’re fighting a formidable enemy, this virus. This virus is a serious issue here.
Though the ad implies Fauci was talking about Trump, Fauci never mentioned the president.
""In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,"" Fauci said in an Oct. 11 statement to CNN. ""The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.""
In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 12, Fauci said he thought the Trump campaign ought to take the ad down.
""I think it’s really unfortunate and really disappointing that they [officials in the Trump campaign] did that,"" Fauci added. ""And to take a completely out of context statement and to put it in which is obviously a political campaign ad, I thought was really very disappointing.""
In an Oct. 11 statement to NBC News, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh pushed back, responding: ""These are Dr. Fauci’s own words. The video is from a nationally broadcast television interview in which Dr. Fauci was praising the work of the Trump administration. The words spoken are accurate, and directly from Dr. Fauci’s mouth.""
Trump later echoed that, writing on Twitter, ""They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words. We have done a ‘phenomenal’ job, according to certain governors. Many people agree…And now come the Vaccines & Cures, long ahead of projections!""
They are Fauci’s words, but they are presented in a way to make it seem that Fauci was talking specifically about Trump and his response to the coronavirus when he says, ""I can’t imagine … anybody could be doing more.""
However, in the context of the interview — as confirmed by Fauci himself — he is referring to the efforts of federal public health officials. Even though they are members of the Trump administration, that is not the same thing as praising Trump’s response, which has occasionally been at odds with the guidance of public health officials on everything from reopening states safely to wearing masks and holding rallies.
Since early April, public health officials with the Trump administration have been ""clear and unambiguous,"" as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar recently put it, in support of the public wearing masks when social distancing is not possible. But as we have written, Trump has repeatedly raised doubts about the science, noting that health experts who now advocate public mask-wearing were once opposed to it.
In July, Fauci said the president’s mixed messages on wearing masks were ""not helpful.""
""But I can tell you, you’d have to say it’s not helpful if people get signals about not wearing masks when we are trying to get people to universally wear masks,"" Fauci said. ""My feeling about what we should do with masks is very, very clearly understood by everyone including those in the White House.""
Fauci also took issue with Trump repeatedly promoting the drug hydroxychloroquine, even though members of the administration’s coronavirus task force, including Fauci, warned that scientific studies did not support using the drug to treat COVID-19.
""We know that every single good study — and by good study I mean randomized control study in which the data are firm and believable — has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of COVID-19,"" Fauci said in July.
As the president encouraged and prodded states to lift restrictions on business closures, Fauci faulted some states for opening too quickly, in contradiction of federal guidelines.
""There are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,"" Fauci said in July.
Fauci singled out Florida as an example, saying, ""Certainly Florida I know, you know, I think jumped over a couple of checkpoints.""
Trump repeatedly praised early-opening states, such as Florida, even when some failed to meet the federal guidelines for reopening safely.
Fauci also has been critical of Trump’s insistence on holding densely packed campaign rallies, two of them indoors, where many attendees didn’t wear masks.
In mid-June, as Trump was gearing up for an indoor rally in Tulsa, Fauci was asked if he would attend a Trump rally. ""I’m in a high-risk category. Personally, I would not. Of course not,"" Fauci, who’s 79, said.
In September, ""CBS This Morning"" host  Gayle King asked Fauci if the prevalence of attendees at Trump rallies not wearing masks was frustrating him. Fauci responded, ""Well, yes it is. And I’ve said that often. That situation is, we want to set an example, because we know, we know, that when you do four or five typical kind of public health measures — masks, physical distance, avoiding crowds, making sure you do most things outdoors versus indoors — those are the kind of things that turn around surges, and also prevent us from getting surges.""
""Anybody who has been listening to me over the last several months knows that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,"" he said in an interview on Sept. 30 on ABC News’ ""Start Here"" podcast.
Fauci has at other times been complimentary of Trump’s willingness to follow the advice of federal public health officials in his administration. For example, on April 13, Fauci said that when he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, approached Trump about directing strong mitigation, the president’s response was, ""Yes, we’ll do it.""
But as we said, Trump has not always been on the same page with federal public health officials. So when Fauci praises public health officials, saying he couldn’t imagine ""anybody could be doing more,"" that’s not the same as praising Trump, as the Trump ad suggests.

Viral social media posts cite a flawed paper in falsely claiming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed death certificate procedures and violated federal law, resulting in wildly inflated COVID-19 deaths. The CDC hasn’t altered how death certificates for COVID-19 are filled out, and there is no federal law governing the process.

              It’s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn’t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.
The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the United States as of July 9.
An individual’s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person’s age or health conditions. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is more than 600 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29.

Full Story
A conservative talk radio host recently told her listeners that because of a change in death certificate procedures specific to COVID-19, ""there is a huge chance that COVID death numbers are exaggerated, to the tune of 94%.""
That’s false. It’s based on a flawed report whose authors also have penned related claims for an anti-vaccination organization.
Wendy Bell, the radio host, made the claim in a March 25 episode of her Pennsylvania-based show. The show was streamed live on Facebook in a video titled, ""Has the CDC skewed Covid Fatalities?"" It has been viewed more than 34,000 times.

""I’ve reported multiple times that the CDC has said in its own little asterisk, bottom footnote: Of all deaths reported by coroners and health departments to the CDC, only 6% list COVID as the cause of death,"" Bell says about 41 minutes into her video. ""COVID is what killed this individual — not the tree that they ran into that killed them from blunt force trauma or whatever, and then they got tested in the morgue, but COVID. That 6% number is very significant, and now the CDC is walking it back.""
We’re not sure what she means by the ""CDC is walking it back."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website still makes note of the statistic that she’s referencing. But the statistic doesn’t mean, as Bell implies, that COVID-19 didn’t actually cause the other deaths.
We addressed similar social media posts in September that misrepresented CDC data on COVID-19 deaths. As we wrote, CDC data showed COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on 6% of death certificates, while the other 94% of deaths included other illnesses or conditions, or comorbidities.
That’s not unusual since COVID-19 often causes other serious conditions, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome — which rank among the most-cited comorbidities for deaths involving COVID-19. Long-term conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19, such as diabetes or hypertension, are also among the comorbidities listed on death certificates.
The CDC notes, however, that 91% of all death certificates mentioning COVID-19 listed it as the underlying cause of death — or the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person’s death.
Report’s Origins
Now, Bell repeats the distortion about the 6% statistic and cites a paper that erroneously suggests the data is inflated because the CDC changed how such deaths are counted, and falsely claims it violated federal law.
Reading from a March 19 story in the conservative outlet the Epoch Times, Bell tells her listeners: ""A little-noticed peer-reviewed study published last October by a science and public health journal claims the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ignored federal laws and regulations when it changed how the government counts deaths from COVID-19, caused by the Wuhan virus.""
The paper referenced appeared in a publication called Science, Public Health Policy, and The Law. The publication started in 2019 and is the product of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, an organization run by James Lyons-Weiler. Lyons-Weiler is a scientist with a Ph.D. in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology from the University of Nevada, Reno, who has previously spread false information about COVID-19 vaccines.
Most of the paper’s authors also wrote a related post, cited in the report, for Children’s Health Defense, an organization run by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. 
We reached out to the report’s lead author, Henry Ealy, a naturopathic doctor based in Oregon, with some questions about its main points and didn’t receive an on-the-record response.
In addition to Bell and the Epoch Times, the paper’s claims have been amplified by other conservative outlets. A February story on the website the National File — headlined ""BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law"" — was shared more than 16,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
Guidance Didn’t Violate Federal Law
The paper’s authors say that, ""[b]ased upon our investigation of Federal Register Records for 2020, there was no formal, transparent, public review process initiated by the NVSS or CDC prior to or following the issuance of the March 24th NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 that dramatically altered cause of death reporting exclusively for COVID-19.""
The March 24, 2020, alert being referenced came from the National Vital Statistics System, part of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. It notified the public of a new International Classifications of Diseases code for COVID-19 — since the disease was new, there was no previous code — and offered brief guidance on using it.
Days after the March 24 alert, the CDC issued April 2, 2020, guidance explaining more thoroughly how COVID-19 death certificates should be completed. (The agency has issued similar death reporting guidance for other issues, such as for fatalities due to drug toxicity and relating to disaster events.)
In short, the paper’s authors argue that the March 24 notice was subject to the Information Quality Act and Paperwork Reduction Act — and therefore should have been publicized in the Federal Register and subject to public comment.
But there’s no support for that claim.
First of all, we should note that there is no federal law governing death certificate processes.
Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email that ""the collection of death certificate data is not covered by the [Paperwork Reduction Act],"" as the paper suggests.
""Death certificate data is collected by the states (i.e., 57 jurisdictions, including 50 states, New York City, District of Columbia and 5 territories), according to state laws and regulations, not according to federal laws or regulations,"" he said. ""While CDC, i.e., the National Center for Health Statistics, does work with the states to coordinate and promote standardized data collection, along with guidance on some issues such as cause of death certification, NCHS does not (and cannot) impose any legal requirements.""
Anderson said that states develop laws and regulations with the standards in mind, and ""[o]nce the data are collected by the states, NCHS purchases the data from the states in order to provide national statistics.""
Bridget Dooling, a research professor at the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, said that since the collection of death certificate data isn’t subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, the CDC’s March 24 guidance wouldn’t be, either.
Dooling — who worked at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, within the White House Office of Management and Budget, from 2007 to 2018 — also said in a phone interview that the guidance wouldn’t be subject to the Information Quality Act, since those provisions relate to the ways in which government disseminates information.
Public health legal experts similarly told our fact-checking colleagues at AFP that the CDC’s guidance didn’t violate federal law.
Baseless Claim of Reporting Change
In addition to the claim about the legality of the CDC’s COVID-19 death reporting guidance, the paper’s main contention is that the guidance was a stark departure from the CDC’s guidelines used since 2003. It baselessly suggests that, using the 2003 guidance, COVID-19 fatalities would ""be approximately 16.7 times lower than is currently being reported.""
""If the fatality data being presented by the CDC is illegally inflated, then all public health policies based upon them would be immediately null and void,"" the authors wrote.
But the paper misconstrues how death certificates are completed, experts say, and wrongly concludes that a massive change occurred.
""The death certification process has not been changed by the CDC,"" Dr. James Gill, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, told us in an email. ""I still fill out death certificates the way I have been doing it for over 20 years.""
Gill, the chief medical examiner in Connecticut, pointed out that the paper illustrates a misunderstanding of how death certificates are completed.
For example, the paper says that Part I of the death certificate ""is the immediate cause of death listed in sequential order from the official cause on line item (a) to the underlying causes that contributed to death in descending order of importance on line item (d).""
But it’s the most important diagnosis — the underlying cause of death — that is to be listed on the lowest line of Part I, Gill said. The condition immediately preceding death (such as pneumonia) would be listed first and then the illness that caused that condition (COVID-19, for example) would be listed below it.
Similarly, Anderson, the chief of the CDC’s mortality statistics branch, said the ""authors of the October paper do not seem to understand how death certificates are designed or how the cause of death should be certified.""
A comparison of the 2003 guidelines and the COVID-19 guidance doesn’t reveal any significant change in procedure.
""Part I is for reporting a chain of events leading directly to death, with the immediate cause of death (the final disease, injury, or complication directly causing death) on line (a) and the underlying cause of death (the disease or injury that initiated the chain of events that led directly and inevitably to death) on the lowest used line,"" the 2003 guidelines say. ""Part II is for reporting all other significant diseases, conditions, or injuries that contributed to death but which did not result in the underlying cause of death given in Part I.""
And here’s how the CDC explained the completion of death certificates in its April 2020 guidance specific to COVID-19, beginning with Part I:
CDC, ""Guidance for Certifying Deaths Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19),"" April 2, 2020: This section on the death certificate is for reporting the sequence of conditions that led directly to death. The immediate cause of death, which is the disease or condition that directly preceded death and is not necessarily the underlying cause of death (UCOD), should be reported on line a. The conditions that led to the immediate cause of death should be reported in a logical sequence in terms of time and etiology below it. The UCOD, which is ""(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury"" (7), should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I. … Other significant conditions that contributed to the death, but are not a part of the sequence in Part I, should be reported in Part II. Not all conditions present at the time of death have to be reported—only those conditions that actually contributed to death.
So it’s not accurate to claim that the CDC’s COVID-19 guidance represented a significant departure from the 2003 guidelines, as the paper repeatedly says.
It’s unclear why the authors conclude that, under the 2003 guidelines, COVID-19 would have been ""more correctly"" included ""in Part II as an infection that contributed to death.""
The authors also say that the ""inclusion of probable fatalities"" is indicative that the ""data presented is inaccurate.""
But the 2003 document, in fact, notes that the cause of death is to be determined according to the best medical opinion — and clearly states: ""A condition can be listed as ‘probable’ even if it has not been definitively diagnosed.""
And contrary to Bell’s insinuation that fatalities are being deliberately inflated by deaths unrelated to the disease — such as ""the tree that they ran into that killed them from blunt force trauma or whatever"" — the CDC explicitly advises that COVID-19 not be reported in such cases where the disease didn’t factor into the death.
The CDC emphasizes: ""COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death.""
Finally, the paper makes no mention of excess deaths. As we’ve previously explained, excess deaths are deaths above the number expected in a given time period. In the context of COVID-19, it can help assess the true impact of the pandemic by capturing direct and indirect effects of the virus. It can account for unreported COVID-19 deaths and for other factors, such as people dying from other causes (say, avoiding medical attention), as well as drops in other deaths due to pandemic-related restrictions.
A New York Times analysis of CDC mortality data shows that, from March 2020 to February 2021, deaths nationwide were about 21% higher than what would have been expected during that time period.

		Quick Take
An image circulating on social media erroneously claims that the total number of deaths in the U.S. this year is significantly down compared to previous years. The meme — which implies COVID-19 restrictions weren’t needed — actually uses an incomplete figure for 2020 and makes a flawed comparison.

Full Story
A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that from late January through Oct. 3, there were an estimated 299,028 excess deaths — meaning deaths higher than what would be expected during that time period, based on previous years. Two-thirds were estimated to be directly attributed to COVID-19.
But a popular post shared on Instagram and Facebook is erroneously claiming that the total number of deaths is actually down, significantly, this year compared to years past.
""The Stats – Why We’ve All Had Our Lives Stolen From Us in 2020,"" the meme is headlined. It then lists ""US Deaths Per Year"" from 2015 through 2019, and compares those figures to a figure for 2020 (as of Nov. 16) to suggest total deaths are actually down this year.
On Instagram, the post was shared with a caption suggesting that the media has misled on the COVID-19 pandemic.
But it’s the meme that’s misleading by using an incomplete figure for 2020 to make its claim, as well as an erroneous number for 2019.

The number of deaths cited for 2020 — 2,487,350, as of Nov. 16 — was taken that day from a table published by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.
The table, however, only accounted for deaths from Feb. 1 through Nov. 14, so it doesn’t include any deaths that occurred in January 2020 — or, of course, any that will occur in the final weeks of the year.
Also, the figures in the table are provisional — meaning some states may continue to update tallies for up to eight weeks, Bob Anderson, chief of the NCHS’ Mortality Statistics Branch, told us in a phone interview.
The public can see that in action: The same table shows that deaths for the same reporting period (of Feb. 1 through Nov. 14) has since climbed to 2,533,214 (as of Nov. 20).
And that, again, doesn’t include January — when there were an estimated 240,000 deaths, Anderson said. And again, we don’t know how many deaths will occur in the remaining weeks of 2020; Anderson noted that deaths tend to trend upward in the winter.
Yet the meme juxtaposes that incomplete 2020 figure against complete death totals for 2015 (2,712,630) through 2018 (2,839,205), which are accurate and pulled from annual ""Mortality in the United States"" reports published by NCHS.
Anderson said it was unclear where the meme got its 2019 figure of 2,900,689 deaths. While NCHS has not released a ""Mortality in the United States"" report for 2019 yet, NCHS’ provisional estimate is 2,852,308.
Whatever the 2020 figure turns out to be, the chart misleadingly downplays the risk of COVID-19 — which so far has killed nearly 1.4 million people worldwide, including more than 250,000 people in the U.S.

The ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. are publicly available. Yet a false claim that the vaccines contain microchips is receiving renewed attention through a spate of videos of people claiming that magnets stick to their arms after vaccination. Experts say none of the ingredients would cause this supposed effect.

              How do we know what ingredients are in a vaccine?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              The full ingredient list for any authorized COVID-19 vaccine can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website and in a variety of documents on the Food and Drug Administration’s website, including in a fact sheet for vaccine recipients that’s available in numerous languages. 
Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines contain messenger RNA, or mRNA; a variety of fatty molecules, or lipids, to protect the mRNA; and a few other ingredients, including salts and sugar, to keep the vaccine stable and at a similar acidity to the human body. The Johnson & Johnson, or Janssen, vaccine contains a harmless adenovirus — a type of virus that typically causes the common cold — modified with the genetic material for SARS-CoV-2, as well as salts as stabilizing and buffering agents.
There are no preservatives, egg or latex in the vaccines.

              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
Despite misconceptions about what is used to make COVID-19 vaccines, the ingredients for each vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are publicly available. As we’ve explained, readers can find the full ingredient list through Food and Drug Administration fact sheets for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

But a false claim that arose well before the vaccines began to roll out — that the shots contain ""microchips"" — is spreading online once again, this time with help from a round of videos purporting to show evidence.
In one video posted across social media platforms, a woman claims to show a magnet sticking to her arm — a result, she alleges, of a recent vaccination.
""Here’s the magnet. This is the arm I got the Pfizer shot in,"" she says, placing what appears to be a small silver, circular magnet on her left arm. ""And there it is.""
After it appears to stay in place, she then quickly hits the magnet against her other arm — ""the arm that I didn’t get the shot"" — and it falls to the ground. ""You go figure it out. We’re chipped. We’re all f—ed.""
One Instagram post including that video was viewed more than 110,000 times. On TikTok, a similar video involving a Yoda magnet was liked more than 702,000 times before it was deleted.
There’s a lot we don’t know about the various videos, including whether the people in the videos were vaccinated, what magnets might have been used and whether other substances were used to make the objects stick.
But there is no support for the false claim that the vaccines contain ""microchips"" or ingredients that would result in such a magnetic effect.
We’ve debunked several false claims regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and supposed microchips. In April 2020, a conspiracy theory misinterpreted projects done by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to erroneously suggest that Bill Gates planned to use COVID-19 vaccines to ""track people.""
Similarly, in December, a video swirling on social media wrongly claimed the vaccines contained a microchip that ""tracks the location of the patient."" In reality, the claim was a distortion about a proposed technology for use on plastic vials that would track vaccine doses — not people.
Now, the videos involving magnets add new fuel to the same false narrative.
Lisa Morici, an associate professor at the Tulane University School of Medicine who studies vaccines, emphasized in an email that the ""ingredients in the mRNA and adenovirus vaccines are simply RNA/DNA, lipids, proteins, salts, and sugars."" (The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use modified messenger RNA to provide instructions for cells to make spike proteins, while the J&J vaccine uses an adenovirus modified with DNA for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.)
""All of these components are found in numerous foods, vaccines, and medicines,"" she said.
""The ‘microchip’ is of course a myth being spread on social media,"" she said. ""‘Micro’ refers to the size of the chip = microns in size, whereas the mRNA and adenovirus vaccines are nanoparticles, meaning nanometers in size. The vaccines are therefore 1000x smaller than a microchip and a microchip couldn’t fit in the vaccine.""
As for the notion that vaccines could be responsible for a magnetic effect, two experts we contacted said none of the ingredients for the three vaccines would cause this supposed result.
""In order for a regular magnet to stick to something else magnetically, the something else should either possess significant magnetic remanence (like another magnet), or relative magnetic permeability significantly exceeding unity (like many refrigerator doors),"" Mark Allen, a professor of electrical and systems engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. ""According to the FDA fact sheets about the three FDA-authorized [COVID-19] vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J), none of the ingredients in any of the three vaccines contain any materials with these properties (significant magnetic remanence or relative magnetic permeability significantly exceeding unity.)""
He noted that ""magnets wouldn’t stick to the silicon in silicon microchips either."" In short, he said: ""Magnets won’t stick to you just because you have received a [COVID-19] vaccine.""
Randall Victora, head of the department of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Minnesota, further told us: ""Although almost all materials are magnetic in the sense of paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and ferromagnetism, only a ferromagnet has the potential to make a magnet stick to your arm.""
Victora said ""none of the listed ingredients in the Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson and Johnson vaccines are a ferromagnet, and thus they cannot cause a magnet to stick to your arm. Incidentally, most microchips do not have ferromagnetic components either.""
In one video viewed more than 10,000 times on YouTube, a man visits a store in Chicago called American Science & Surplus and shows a package of ""rare earth magnets"" sticking to his left arm. He encourages others to visit the store to ""do this magnet challenge.""
Kristina Apostolou, the assistant manager at the store, told us that the man visited the store on May 12 to tape his video but said she couldn’t say what caused the magnets to stick to his arm.
During our phone interview, Apostolou, who said she has not received a COVID-19 vaccine, and a colleague, who she said did receive a vaccine in recent days, both attempted to recreate the ""magnet challenge"" with the same package. But ""neither of us had the effect,"" she said.
In another video on YouTube, the same man seen in the Chicago shop claims to show magnets sticking not only to the arm that he says he received a vaccine in — but his other arm, too.
Gustav Kuhn, a psychology researcher at Goldsmiths, University of London, who studies magic and illusions — and the president of the Science of Magic Association — also reviewed a handful of the videos for us. ""It’s difficult, if not impossible to know why the magnet sticks in these situations,"" he said in an email.
That said, he noted that there are simple, known sleights of hand that are not too dissimilar. One could use an adhesive such as sticky tape to make something appear as a magnet. There’s also a trick in which one makes it appear that a coin sticks to their head.
""It doesn’t rely on magnets [or] sticky tape,"" he said. ""You just push the coin to your forehead. You can try it yourself.""

		Noting that the United States accounts for about one-quarter of global COVID-19 cases and deaths, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. has ""the worst record of any country in the world."" While the U.S. has the most confirmed cases and deaths by a wide margin, it does not have the most in either category on a per-capita basis.
Pelosi emphasized the U.S. share of coronavirus-related cases and deaths during a June 28 interview on ABC’s ""This Week"" in which she argued the Trump administration is not taking the growing outbreak in several U.S. states seriously.
""We are 4% of the world’s population,"" the Democratic leader told host George Stephanopoulos. ""We are 25% of the cases and the deaths, 25%. We have the worst record of any country in the world. And the president says we’re making progress or whatever.""
Pelosi got the percentages right, but where the U.S. ranks in dealing with the pandemic depends on how one looks at the numbers.
Total Confirmed Cases
Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, confirmed to FactCheck.org in an email that the congresswoman labeled the U.S. the ""worst"" based on it ""having the most coronavirus deaths and confirmed cases of any country.""
According to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data, as of June 28, the day Pelosi made her claim, there were 9.95 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and 2.51 million, or 25%, of those cases were in the U.S — the most of any nation.
The U.S. total was 1.2 million cases more than the second-highest country, Brazil, which had 1.31 million cases as of that day.

Confirmed Cases Per Capita
But the U.S. did not have the most cases per capita — which takes into account a country’s population.
As of June 28, the U.S. had 7,584 confirmed cases per 1 million people, which was fewer cases than nine other nations, including Chile (14,007.27), Kuwait (10,394.65) and Peru (8,370.44). Qatar, which has an estimated population of almost 3 million, had the most cases per capita — 32,509.91 per 1 million people.

Total Confirmed Deaths
Based on the raw numbers, the U.S. also led all countries with 125,539, or 25%, of the 498,521 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, as of June 28 — according to Our World in Data figures. Brazil again was second to the U.S. with 57,070 confirmed deaths.

Confirmed Deaths Per Capita
Per capita, however, the U.S. — with 379.27 confirmed deaths per 1 million people — had fewer fatalities from COVID-19 than eight other nations.
Among those countries with more confirmed deaths per capita: Belgium (839.72), the United Kingdom (640.99), Italy (574.18), Sweden (522.81) and France (456.20).

Case Fatality Rate
In addition, the U.S. had a lower COVID-19 case fatality rate than several nations. The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by confirmed cases.
As of June 28, the U.S. rate was 5% — lower than the rate in dozens of other countries.

According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S., as of June 30, has the fifth highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and the second highest per-capita death rate.
Pelosi’s claim, that the U.S. has fared the worst based on its total confirmed cases and deaths, reminded us of President Donald Trump’s claims that the U.S. leads the world in testing for COVID-19 simply based on the number of tests performed.
In Trump’s case, we also pointed out that because of the large U.S. population, a per-capita comparison would be a better gauge of countries’ testing efforts. By that measurement, we found the U.S. trailed at least a dozen countries in testing for the disease, as of May 9, and it’s still not leading the world.
Pelosi no doubt has a point about the large number of confirmed cases and deaths in the U.S. — and it is in no way our intention to minimize the seriousness of the situation.
But, similar to Trump’s boasts on testing, whether the U.S. has the ""worst record"" – as Pelosi said — also depends on the metric used.

		During a campaign rally in Wisconsin, President Donald Trump questioned the reported numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. by describing a purported ""incentive"" to report cases and deaths, because ""doctors get more money and hospitals get more money.""
Trump’s comments tapped into a months-old, baseless conspiracy theory for which there is no evidence: that COVID-19 deaths have been inflated by hospitals seeking to profit. Multiple experts previously told us that such claims were unfounded.
Trump’s remarks came during an Oct. 24 rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin.
Trump, Oct. 24: If somebody’s terminally ill with cancer, and they have COVID, we report them. And you know, doctors get more money and hospitals get more money. Think of this incentive. So some countries do it differently. If somebody is very sick with a bad heart, they die of COVID, they don’t get reported as COVID. So then you wonder, gee, I wonder why their cases are so low.
This country and their reporting systems are really not doing it right. If somebody has a really bad heart, and they’re close to death, even if they’re not, but they have a very bad heart and they get COVID, they put it down to COVID. Other countries put it down to a heart. So we have to be — we’re gonna to start looking at things because you know, they have things back — they have things a little bit backwards.
The supposed ""incentive"" referenced by Trump is likely a reference to the financial assistance for hospitals treating COVID-19 patients that was created by bipartisan legislation — and that Trump himself signed into law in March.
As we’ve explained, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, created a 20% add-on to be paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients with COVID-19; Medicare is the federal health insurance program for those 65 years and older. The law also set aside some money to reimburse hospitals for treating uninsured patients.
That fact alone is not evidence of misreporting or fraud, though — especially at levels large enough to significantly affect the country’s current death toll of 227,000.
Medical associations rejected the president’s suggestion that deaths were being improperly counted for financial reasons.
The American College of Emergency Physicians said in a statement it was ""appalled by President Trump’s reckless and false assertions that physicians are overcounting deaths related to COVID-19.""
The American Medical Association challenged the claims by pointing to this year’s excess mortality in the U.S. — meaning the actual number of deaths from all causes, minus a ""normal"" or expected number of deaths during a given time period. That metric is an alternative way of estimating the impact of the coronavirus that avoids issues of miscounting or underreporting COVID-19 deaths. It also captures the indirect effects of the pandemic, such as those who died from other causes because they avoided or were unable to access medical care.
From late January through Oct. 3, there were an estimated 299,028 excess deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; about two-thirds were directly attributed to COVID-19. (The deaths in that report were based on death certificates from the National Vital Statistics System, which lags behind other measures because of the time it takes to complete and process certificates, the CDC told us.)
The U.S. does not have an especially good record on excess mortality compared to other countries, as we’ve reported.
According to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Oct. 12 that compared the U.S. to 14 other countries, America had a higher rate of per capita excess mortality than all but two nations since the start of the pandemic through late July. And University of Oxford economists Janine Aron and John Muellbauer concluded in a report published last month that the U.S.’s excess mortality rate is ""substantially worse"" than Europe’s.
To be clear, there could be some cases that are misreported. But experts also have said the official death toll may be underestimated, in part because excess mortality figures are higher.
We asked the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services whether it could point to any specific cases of fraudulent reporting or billing for COVID-19 cases and it didn’t answer our question.
Instead, the agency noted the requirement of a positive COVID-19 test for the enhanced Medicare reimbursement — a requirement implemented in September — and said that if, upon review, the medical record lacks a positive test, that increased payment will be considered an overpayment and recouped by CMS.
Writing for Medscape, Ashish K. Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, said the enhanced payments came about because ""policymakers knew that hospitals would need the extra money in order to provide their staff with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The federal government was not going to be able to provide all of the needed PPE. The funds were a way to help make hospitals whole. But it hasn’t. Most hospitals are bleeding money as a result of COVID.""
Jha said there have also been arguments about hospitals improperly reporting ""car accident victims who tested positive for COVID"" — which he called ""nonsense.""
""There is no higher reimbursement that I can find for car accident victims who are COVID positive. And if you bill these patients as COVID pneumonia, that is fraud,"" he said.
Karyn Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us in a phone interview that hospitals have other incentives for testing and identifying COVID-19 cases — regardless of whether someone is covered by Medicare — including making clinical decisions and taking precautions to prevent spread.
Schwartz also pointed out that the enhanced payments only apply to cases of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with COVID-19 — which represent a small fraction of the total U.S. cases.
According to CMS, there were 284,316 total COVID-19 hospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries through Aug. 15. That is only 5% of the 5.3 million confirmed or probable cases in the U.S. reported as of that point in time.
And, Schwartz said, those Medicare payments are based on the diagnosis and diagnosis-related groups — not on outcomes or a death certificate.
That said, it’s worth understanding how COVID-19 deaths are classified.
Death certificates, as we’ve written, can list multiple causes or conditions that contributed to a person’s death. So the disease often shows up alongside other comorbidities. Those ailments could be caused by COVID-19, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or they can be long-term conditions, such as diabetes. It is well-known that seniors and people with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
But in 92% of death certificates in the U.S. citing COVID-19, the disease is listed as the underlying cause of death — meaning the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person’s death — according to the CDC.
The CDC says that its ""mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death"" — including ""the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate.""
Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told our colleagues at PolitiFact: ""If a terminal patient still had, say 6 months to live, but was infected by the virus and died, the certifier might determine that COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death because of the timing.""
""In the same way, if that same terminal cancer patient was in a car accident and died from that trauma, the car accident would be the underlying cause,"" Anderson said. ""If, on the other hand, death from terminal cancer was imminent or COVID-19 symptoms were mild, COVID-19 might be viewed only as a contributing factor — not the underlying cause — or, if the patient was asymptomatic, it might not be viewed as a factor at all — and therefore, not reported on the death certificate.""

		Leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden repeatedly has criticized President Donald Trump for failing to make timely use of his powers under the Defense Production Act to compel companies to manufacture medical supplies that are expected to be needed to treat those infected with the novel coronavirus.
Biden claims he was one of the first to call for the need to use the Defense Production Act. The Trump campaign says Biden only began calling for that on the same day — March 18 — that Trump said he was invoking the act. There’s a bit of spin coming from both sides on this.
We couldn’t find evidence that Biden has been calling for use of the law for as long as he suggests, and Trump did not invoke the full force of the act back on March 18.
With the use of the Defense Production Act becoming a frequent point of contention between Trump and his critics, we thought it would be helpful to explain what the act is and how Trump has (and has not) applied it to date.
What Is the Defense Production Act?
First enacted in 1950 in response to the Korean War and last amended in 2018, the Defense Production Act provides the president broad authority to ""influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense,"" as a Congressional Research Service report put it in 2020.
""The authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense,"" the CRS report states.
The law authorizes the president to identify businesses ""capable"" of producing ""scarce and critical material"" to ""require acceptance and performance"" of contracts to meet those needs. The act also allows the president to incentivize U.S. companies to expand production of critical materials with such things as ""loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities,"" the CRS report says.
As the New York Times reported, the law has been used hundreds of thousands of times during the Trump administration, ""especially by the military to give its contract priority ratings to jump ahead of a vendor’s other clients."" The Times noted that in recent years, the administration has also used the powers contained in the act to restore power grids and to supply emergency food and water in areas devastated by hurricanes in 2017.
On Feb. 28, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar first signaled that the administration might use the Defense Production Act for the coronavirus to expedite contracts for medical supplies, such as face masks and gloves.
""I don’t have any procurements I need it for now, but if I need it, we’ll use it,"" Azar said at a White House briefing.
""We’ll use it if we need to, but we, obviously, if we can work cooperatively with any vendor, we’d rather do that,"" Azar said in a March 1 interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""
On March 13, 57 House Democrats wrote a letter urging the president to ""use the powers afforded by the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. §§4501 et seq.) to begin the mass production of supplies needed to address the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.""
The letter highlighted the likelihood of shortages of N95 respirators and face masks, testing equipment, and medical supplies like ventilators, and warned that ""failure to act now"" could ""endanger American lives.""
""These authorities could be used to direct the domestic production of equipment currently in short supply, like personal protective equipment and ventilators,"" the letter states. ""This would ensure we have the materials we need at the ready, rather than wait for disruptions in the global supply chain to subside.
""During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many small items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world,"" the letter stated. ""We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands. We urge you to invoke the Defense Production Act without delay.""
Trump Invokes the Defense Production Act
Five days later, on March 18, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act ""just in case we need it."" But Trump stopped short of implementing the act to force production of certain goods. Later that day, Trump tweeted, ""I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need.""
Via Twitter, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed the move as ""an important step,"" but added, ""so much more is needed NOW.""
That same day, Biden released a statement on ""immediate actions"" he believed the Trump administration should take to address the pandemic. It called for Trump to ""Prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis — such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate — by invoking the Defense Production Act, delegating authority to HHS and FEMA. This action must be built on forecasted demand, using the best modeling currently available for negative scenarios.""
In the following days, Trump said that he was reluctant to use the Defense Production Act to force corporations to make products, likening such a move to ""nationalizing our businesses.""
Trump, March 22: We’re a country not based on nationalizing our business. Call a person over in Venezuela; ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out. Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept.
Besides, he said, companies were voluntarily stepping up with offers to produce masks, ventilators and other needed medical supplies and equipment.
Trump, March 26: For the most part, the companies … We say, ""We need this,"" and they say, ""Don’t bother. We’re going to do it."" I mean, we — we’re dealing with Ford, General Motors, 3M. We’re dealing with great companies. They want to do this. They want to do this. They’re doing things that — that frankly, they don’t need somebody to walk over there with a — with a hammer and say, ""Do it."" They are getting it done.
We should note that compelling a company to produce supplies is not the same as ""nationalizing"" the business. Under the act, private businesses would be paid for their production and would remain private companies, not government entities.
What Biden Said and When
In recent days, Biden has criticized Trump for failing to fully use the Defense Production Act, something he says Trump should have done weeks or even months ago. Biden has also cast himself as one of the earliest to call for it.

According to a March 22 pool report of a Biden phone call, the Democratic candidate ""reiterated his call for the president to invoke the ‘full power of the Defense Production Act’ and noted he called for that a month ago.""
In a YouTube speech on March 23, Biden said, ""As of late yesterday, we’re told that the president still has not activated the authority under the Defense Production Act, which I and others call for him to invoke immediately and act on, to direct American manufacturers to make essential supplies. Trump keeps saying that he’s a wartime president, well start to act like one. … We need to get in motion. Get in motion today what we should have set in motion weeks ago.
""I would have enacted it a long time ago, Jake,"" Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper on March 24. ""I think it was three — two, three weeks ago I pointed out that the president should enact this. It should have been enacted months ago.""
During an online news conference the following day, Biden said, ""I think it’s really important that we understand that this idea of this Defense Production Act, he talks about signing, he doesn’t want to dictate to companies. There’s things we need now, now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, but months ago or a month ago, and the president’s not acting.""
And finally, on MSNBC on March 30, Biden said, ""I talked about doing the Defense Production Act before anyone came along.""

The Trump campaign said that as far as it could tell, the first time Biden ever called for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was on March 18, the same day Trump invoked it (but did not use it to compel a company to start producing something).
We reached out to the Biden campaign for evidence that Biden had called for use of the Defense Production Act prior to that, but we got no response. We could not find any public comments from Biden prior to the statement he put out on March 18 — which we referenced earlier.
Prior to March 18, we found instances of Biden talking generally, as he did on March 12, about the need to ""surge our capacity"" at hospitals, and make ""sure communities have the hospital beds available, the staff, the medical supplies, the personal protective equipment necessary to treat the patient.""
Biden did not mention the Defense Production Act in the Democratic debate on March 15, where he encouraged viewers to see his full, detailed plan to combat COVID-19 on his campaign website. Nor does that plan, which was initially posted to the campaign website on March 12, mention the Defense Production Act. 
Biden’s plan says only that the federal government should ""[w]ork with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, and additional products such as bleach and alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Incentivize greater supplier production of these critically important medically supplies, including committing, if necessary, to large scale volume purchasing and removing all relevant trade barriers to their acquisition.""
""Work[ing] with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment"" was essentially the Trump administration policy at the time.
If his first public call for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was March 18, Biden would have been exaggerating when he said on March 22 that he called for that a month before, or on March 24 when he said he made those calls ""two, three weeks ago.""
It also would have been five days after 57 House members wrote to the president urging him to use the act, and two days after his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, publicly called on Trump ""to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in the United States of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our health care workers need.""
We will update this story if the Biden campaign gets back to us with earlier examples.
We can say for sure, though, that Biden has repeatedly claimed to have issued a warning about the seriousness of the virus earlier than he actually did.
""All of the way back in January 17, I wrote a piece for U.S. News & World Report saying, ‘We have got a real problem. The president, we have — coronavirus is real. We have to start acting now,'"" Biden said in a March 24 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.
The op-ed he wrote was actually for USA Today, and it was published on Jan. 27, not Jan. 17. Those 10 days make a big difference. Biden’s op-ed on Jan. 27 was just four days before the Trump administration announced travel restrictions on those who had traveled to China in the previous two weeks. Had Biden published that op-ed on Jan. 17, he would have been well ahead of the curve.
We would chalk up Biden’s date mix-up to a simple misstatement, but he has cited that same incorrect date at least three other times since.

""For example, way back in January 17th I argued that this virus was coming. I did a, I think it was US News and World Report, I did a piece on saying it’s coming. We’ve got to prepare,"" Biden said in an online news conference on March 25
""I wrote an article back in January 17th saying we should be prepared now and laid out the things that I thought we should be doing then,"" he said in a CNN town hall on March 27.
""You may recall, I was the first one to call for the president, way back in January 17th, to take this seriously,"" Biden said on March 30 on MSNBC. ""A real serious crisis is coming, an article I wrote.""

Trump Uses Defense Production Act
On March 23, Trump signed a new executive order ""to prohibit the hoarding of needed resources,"" citing the authority given to him under the Defense Production Act. On March 30, federal authorities invoked that order when they charged a Brooklyn man for hoarding surgical masks, medical gowns and other medical supplies that authorities said he was selling at inflated prices from his home.
Despite his early reluctance to employ the Defense Production Act to compel businesses to make supplies necessary for the COVID-19 response, Trump said in a March 27 press conference that he had invoked the act ""to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.""
Trump also tapped Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, to act as national Defense Production Act policy coordinator. At the press conference, Navarro explained that the Defense Production Act was employed to compel General Motors to make ventilators only after the federal government ""ran into roadblocks"" in its negotiations with GM over production.
Navarro, March 27: We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run, to help people of New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country, as this virus bears down. And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill. They’re literally the lifeline for people. And I’ve personally been working with FEMA, and I’ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible. And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time — which is to say as soon as possible, sir. But we did have a problem with GM and Ventec. On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible. Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM. We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days. So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating this mobilization.
In an interview on CNN on March 31, Biden said Trump’s action was too slow, and too limited.
Biden, March 31: And he’s been very slow to act. For whatever the reason has been. Been very slow to act on a whole range of things. For example, he still hasn’t fully invoked the Defense Production Act. Which I called for a while ago. He finally did with General Motors after a little roundabout in terms of building ventilators. What about the masks? What about those gowns that those nurses and doctors need? They’re made of paper. What about the goggles the need, the face shields, what about the gloves they need? He can do that by the Defense Production Act right now. He could have done it yesterday, a week ago, three weeks ago, five weeks ago. They’re in short supply. And our first responders are literally risking and some losing their lives to try to help the American people.
Biden is entitled to his opinion that the president acted slowly and ""still hasn’t fully invoked the Defense Production Act."" But we could find no evidence that Biden called for the president to use the act prior to March 18, despite his repeated claims that he had done so much earlier.

		Quick Take
A viral meme suggests that children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S. and U.K. can’t be visited by a parent. Hospital policies have become generally more restrictive, but pediatric patients are still allowed visits by at least one parent.

Full Story
A meme circulating on social media implores people to stay home in order to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus. The message it’s trying to send is right, but the alarmist claims it makes are wrong.
The meme says: ""[I]f your child gets this virus their going to hospital alone in a van with people they don’t know to a room they don’t know to be with people they don’t know You will be at home without them in their time of need Think about it Stay in.""
It was shared on March 24 by a Facebook page called This is England and was then shared by several other British Facebook pages before it began to circulate on American accounts.
We are focusing on one of the claims — the implication that there is a mandatory policy to separate parents from children who are hospitalized for COVID-19. That isn’t true in either country.
Guidance from the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health in the U.K. says:

""Appropriate medical transport for the patient (and their parent/carer) to hospital will be dealt with by medical transport teams,"" and,
""Ideally only one parent / carer should accompany child to isolation cubicle. Decide who that will be and manage other members appropriately to reduce risk of infection and request they self isolate.""

Many hospitals in the U.K. have eliminated patient visitation, except for children, who are allowed to have a parent or ""carer"" visit.
Guidance is similar in the U.S., with details varying from state to state and hospital to hospital.
In New York, which currently has the most cases of COVID-19 in the country, the state Department of Health recommended that hospitals suspend visitation except in cases where the visitor is essential to the care of the patient. One major hospital system, NewYork-Presbyterian, has used that guidance to end visitation, with some exceptions, including for pediatric patients who may have one visitor.
In the state of Washington, which had the first confirmed case in the U.S., the hospitals run by the University of Washington have suspended all regular patient visits. But patients under 18 are allowed to have visits from a parent or guardian.
Similar policies are in effect in other areas, too, including the hospitals of the Ohio State University and the University of Kentucky.
While the novel coronavirus can sicken people of any age, it is worth noting that those most at risk for becoming severely ill and requiring hospitalization are elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.
Between Feb. 12 and March 16, no patients under 19 years old were admitted to an intensive care unit in the U.S. for treatment of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

      Trump Misleads on H1N1 Swine Flu Testing

		Deflecting attention from the rise in COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said the Obama administration ""stopped testing"" during the H1N1 pandemic. He’s correct that individual reporting was halted after a few months, but some testing did continue — and the two viruses are very different, making the comparison misleading.
Whereas pandemic H1N1 influenza was no worse than the seasonal flu, and testing did not play much of a role in controlling the spread of the virus, COVID-19 is far more deadly, and testing is critical for contact tracing and isolation.
Trump first mentioned the Obama administration’s decision to halt reporting of individual H1N1 influenza cases at a July 13 roundtable on law enforcement, when the president was asked by a reporter whether he would acknowledge that coronavirus cases were rising because of increased spread of the virus, and not just because of testing, as Trump has frequently claimed.
In response, Trump falsely said that the U.S. has one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates — it does not — and then proceeded to say that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden ""stopped testing"" during the 2009 pandemic. 
Trump, July 13: If you know, Biden and Obama stopped their testing; they just stopped it. You probably know that. I’m sure you don’t want to report it. But they stopped testing. Right in the middle, they just went, ""No more testing,"" and on a much lesser problem than the problem that we have, obviously with respect to — this is the worst thing that’s happened since probably 1917. This is a very bad — all over the world. It’s 188 countries right now.
The next day at a press conference in the Rose Garden, Trump brought it up again, this time specifying that he was talking about H1N1.
Trump, July 14: And if you look at the job [Joe Biden] did on swine flu — I looked at a poll — they have polls on everything nowadays — and he — they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it ""N1H1."" H1N1. He got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped, very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said, ""Stop.""
As we have written, the president has made inapt comparisons between COVID-19 and H1N1 before, and the polling claim is trumped up. No polls specifically evaluated Biden’s performance in the 2009 pandemic, but the Obama administration received moderately good marks at the time.
Trump’s latest H1N1 claim appears to stem from a Fox News article that Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany shared in a July 11 tweet. 
""Under Obama/Biden, ‘the CDC abruptly advised states to stop testing for H1N1 flu, and stopped counting individual cases,’ she said, quoting the news story. ""Meanwhile, @realDonaldTrump⁩ has tested 40 million+, leading the world in testing!""
The White House did not respond to our inquiry for more information.
Different Viruses, Different Roles For Testing
It’s true that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped having states report H1N1 cases in late July 2009, a little more than three months after the first U.S. pandemic influenza virus cases were identified in April. 
But the CDC did not ""totally"" stop testing, since some testing continued for surveillance purposes and for select patients. And Trump is omitting relevant context as to why the CDC made that decision — and how the circumstances are different this time around with COVID-19.
The CDC explains in an archived webpage that individual cases of H1N1 pandemic influenza were monitored early on to track the spread of the disease, but as the virus became widespread, the case counts ""became an increasingly inaccurate representation of the true burden of disease"" as many people were mildly ill and did not seek treatment and the vast majority were not tested.
""CDC recognized early in the outbreak that once disease was widespread,"" the website continues, ""it would be more valuable to transition to standard surveillance systems to monitor illness, hospitalizations and deaths.""
On another webpage, the CDC says that individual case counts became ""increasingly impractical and not representative of the true extent of the outbreak"" because only a small proportion of patients were tested for influenza, ""so the true benefit of keeping track of these numbers is questionable."" 
The webpage added that the ""extensive spread"" of the virus made it ""extremely resource-intensive for states to count individual cases,"" and that the agency would continue to track H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths.
Dr. Anne Schuchat, then-director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and now principal deputy director of the CDC, also explained the change in a July 24, 2009, press call, noting that at that point in the pandemic there had been 43,771 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza and 302 deaths in the U.S.
""But as we’ve been saying, that’s really just the tip of the iceberg, so we’re no longer going to expect the states will continue this individual reporting and we’re going to transition to other ways of describing the illness and the pattern,"" she said. ""We believe there have been well over a million cases of the new H1N1 virus so far in the United States.""
The decision followed the World Health Organization’s July 16 announcement that it would no longer issue global reports on the number of confirmed H1N1 cases, given the difficulty of testing such a large number of cases, and the fact that such counts were ""no longer essential in such countries for monitoring either the level or nature of the risk posed by the pandemic virus or to guide implementation of the most appropriate response measures.""
The CDC would go on to report estimates of the number of H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. throughout the pandemic, specifically trying to use statistical methods to account for underreporting.
Dr. Nicole Lurie, a physician and assistant secretary for preparedness and response during the H1N1 pandemic, told us the comparison to COVID-19 is ""really misleading.""
""The role of testing in those two diseases is terribly different,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In flu, the major reason that they tested people at the beginning of the epidemic was so that you would know when influenza arrived in different communities.""
But once the virus had arrived and established itself, she said, doctors could ""make a pretty good presumption"" that people with flu-like symptoms had flu.
""Individual testing was no longer needed because it was just wasteful and provided no additional information,"" said Lurie, who is now a strategic advisor to the CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to developing vaccines to stop epidemics, including COVID-19.
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, also told us that testing for H1N1 was not particularly valuable because the virus was so prevalent, and there was a readily available therapy — Tamiflu and other similar antivirals, which also work on seasonal flu.
""The testing was onerous,"" he said, noting that a confirmatory diagnostic test could take days to come back with results. ""The rapid tests were not very accurate, and we had an antiviral, and we didn’t want people to refrain from giving them an antiviral because they were waiting for a test or the test result was negative.""
There are no FDA-approved drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19, although research suggests the investigational drug remdesivir may shorten the time to recovery and the steroid medication dexamethasone may improve survival of critically ill patients.
The situation with COVID-19, Lurie said, is very different, because testing is still critical for understanding where the coronavirus is spreading and because it’s an essential public health tool for controlling the virus.
""Testing triggers isolation and contact tracing,"" Lurie said of the COVID-19 situation. ""So for disease control, it’s really important to test. That was not the case with flu.""
Critically, too, is the fact that pandemic H1N1 influenza wasn’t nearly as dangerous as COVID-19. While there is still debate about exactly how deadly the novel coronavirus is, most experts peg the infection fatality rate at around 0.6% to 1%. 
According to CDC estimates, the H1N1 pandemic infected 60.8 million Americans over a year, but led to just 12,469 deaths. That puts the infection fatality rate at 0.02%, or some 30 to 50 times less deadly than COVID-19.
""The mortality rate of H1N1 pandemic virus was lower than seasonal influenza,"" Adalja said. ""We found that out very quickly, and that also influenced how we dealt with it.""
As of July 16, there have been nearly 3.5 million COVID-19 cases and more than 137,000 deaths in the U.S., per the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker — although both numbers are likely underestimates.
Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives and head of the CDC during the H1N1 pandemic, also noted these differences in a statement given to FactCheck.org.
""Testing data are only as useful as the actions they inform — and in the case of the 2009 H1N1 and current COVID-19 pandemics, they have very different roles,"" he said. 
Because the 2009 H1N1 strain was not more dangerous than a typical seasonal influenza, which has led to between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths annually since 2010, most people did not seek care or get diagnosed. As a result, he said, for every laboratory confirmed case from April to October 2009, there were around 79 cases that went undiagnosed.
""So it was never practical to identify cases, trace their contacts, and ask exposed people to quarantine,"" Frieden said, adding that by July, collecting national data was no longer important because the data ""were not a good measure of the scale of the epidemic, nor actionable for contact tracing.""
COVID-19, on the other hand, is ""qualitatively different,"" he said, since it does lead to severe disease in many cases. ""Although not everyone who contracts the virus seeks and receives testing, a higher share do, so testing data is a more useful indicator of the direction of the epidemic,"" Frieden said.
""When someone compares these two pandemics and says – correctly – that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was ‘a much lesser problem than the problem that we have,’ they are inadvertently explaining exactly why reporting of testing data is so much important now than it was then,"" he said. ""The current pandemic is much more severe, which is why we have used public health and social measures to box in the virus, and testing is a key component of that.""
Adalja said he thought the CDC’s decision to stop individual reporting for H1N1 was reasonable. ""We didn’t have molecular diagnostic testing as widespread in 2009 as it was in 2020, and the rapid tests just weren’t accurate enough,"" he said, ""so we knew we were undercounting.""
Lurie said anyone who makes the H1N1 comparison to the coronavirus doesn’t understand very much about COVID-19. ""It’s kind of like comparing oranges and basketballs,"" she said. ""They’re both orange, but that’s about as far as you get.""

		Following a flawed rollout of test kits in the U.S. for the new coronavirus, politicians have given inaccurate information related to the diagnostic tests distributed by the World Health Organization.

Former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed that the WHO ""offered the testing kits that they have available"" but ""we refused them."" The U.S. did not actively turn down testing kits from the WHO, although it could have requested them. The kits, however, are primarily intended for lower income nations without testing capacity.
President Donald Trump also falsely claimed that the WHO test ""was a bad test."" The test is highly accurate and has performed well.

Biden’s comments came during his one-on-one March 15 Democratic debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, when he responded to a question about whether Trump was justified in complaining that inherited bureaucratic red tape hampered the administration’s response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.
Biden, March 15: No, look, the World Health Organization offered — offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own.
Biden is right that the U.S. wanted to make its own test, but he leaves out important context — including the fact that many countries with the scientific capability designed their own tests, and that the WHO test kits are largely meant for less wealthy countries with weaker health systems. And he’s wrong that the U.S. ever ""refused"" a test from the WHO.
Trump’s claim appeared at the end of a March 17 press conference, when a reporter asked the president about Biden’s claim. 
Two other coronavirus task force members stepped in to respond, with coronavirus coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx discussing the importance of quality control and alluding to potential test defects, and Adm. Brett Giroir refuting the idea that the U.S. refused tests from the WHO. 
After both had spoken, Trump summarized things by saying, ""So, number one, nothing was offered. Number two, it was a bad test. Otherwise, it was wonderful."" Trump is correct on the first point, but incorrect on the second — evidence indicates the test has performed well.

U.S. Didn’t ‘Refuse’ WHO Test Kits
Biden may have gotten the impression that the U.S. ""refused"" test kits from the WHO from a news report. A March 6 Politico story his campaign sent to us refers to the ""Trump administration’s decision to forgo a World Health Organization test"" and mentions that 60 countries received WHO tests. But Biden’s comments distort the situation.
""To our knowledge, no discussions occurred between WHO and CDC (or other USG agencies) about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the US,"" WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told us in an emailed statement. ""This is consistent with experience since the US does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.""
This point was also made by Giroir, a coronavirus task force member and the person in charge of coordinating diagnostic testing. 
Speaking in the same press conference in which Trump would incorrectly call the WHO test ""bad,"" Giroir said that when he became involved in the COVID-19 effort, he called the most ""senior officials at the WHO as I could find,"" and ""as far as I can tell from sources that should know, no one ever offered a test that we refused.""
And during a CNN/Facebook town hall on March 19, Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, also debunked the notion.
""WHO developed the tests mainly to support countries with weaker health systems,"" he said, noting that the U.S. has a ""fabulous"" scientific system and ""a wonderful capacity"" to develop tests. ""So no, we did not offer the tests to the U.S., which would be standard practice,"" he added. ""If we were asked, obviously, we would have responded.""
The WHO told us that countries ""did not have to pay"" for the tests it distributed, which were produced by a manufacturer in Germany.
Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us that the WHO tests are typically intended for low- and middle-income countries that lack the ability to test.
In part, this is because any assay, or test, the WHO might choose to produce could be easily manufactured in the U.S. or European Union, Sampath said, so the agency doesn’t usually supply kits to those countries.
Still, he said, any nation — even wealthy ones — can request a test kit from the WHO. ""They don’t restrict them to low- and middle-income countries,"" he said.
The WHO did not share a list of the 120 countries that it said were sent nearly 1.5 million tests as of March 16, but a survey of agency statements reveals that many are concentrated in poorer parts of the world that have less scientific expertise than the U.S. 
Around 40 of them appear to be African Union countries, which the WHO’s director-general said had acquired the ability to test by Feb. 26 ""using lab kits sent by WHO."" The WHO has also said it assisted 29 countries in the Americas — including some Caribbean islands and much of South and Central America — and nations in Southeast Asia with testing supplies and training.
Countries the WHO has specifically named include Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and North Korea. 
Special attention has also been given to Iran, which on March 2 the WHO said it had supplied with 100,000 tests and on March 11 said it had given another 40,000 tests. That tally suggests that just under 10% of all the tests the WHO shipped went to Iran.
Biden presents the U.S. decision to make its own test as a critical error. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not respond to our questions about its testing decisions. But it’s not unusual for the U.S. to proceed in this manner, and the agency likely started creating its test before any other test protocols were publicly available. 
Sampath said it’s common for nations with the scientific know-how to develop their own diagnostics. And indeed, the U.S. is one of several countries, such as China, Japan, Thailand and France, that did so for COVID-19.
As soon as the genome sequences of the new virus were released, Sampath said, various countries immediately started developing their own protocols and their own assays.
And the CDC did develop a viable test very rapidly. It’s not clear exactly when the test was first ready, but the agency successfully used its own test to identify the nation’s first COVID-19 case on Jan. 20 and a CDC report suggests the test was operational at least two days earlier. 
As we’ve explained before, the CDC ran into trouble in February when it scaled up production of its test kits to send out to public health labs around the country. The agency attributed the problem to a manufacturing defect with one of the three sets of reagents used to identify the virus. 
A little over two weeks after announcing the problem, the agency provided a fix, telling labs that the problematic assay using the third set of reagents could be scrapped without sacrificing test accuracy. But the manufacturing snafu, along with other limitations on which tests could be used and which labs could do testing, delayed the expansion of the nation’s testing capacity. The U.S., however, was never without the ability to test for COVID-19.
Sampath noted that even if the CDC had opted to use another test design, manufacturing errors could have still been a problem. 
""No matter which primers they were using,"" he said, referring to one component of the test, ""they could have had the same issue.""
The ‘WHO Test’
It’s worth pausing here to explain that the test the WHO has distributed is a modified version of the diagnostic test created by researchers at the Charité, a medical research institute in Berlin.
As with the CDC test, the German test uses a molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to scan through a patient sample to see if the virus is present. Both tests are largely the same, but the short passages of the viral genome that each test checks for are different. 
Because the test did not originate with the WHO, it is not fully accurate to call the test the ""WHO test."" 
In a March 7 statement, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn claimed as much, saying that the ""WHO does not have its own test that it is distributing globally,"" and that the organization has ""only posted on its website protocols from some test developers, such as the CDC."" 
It’s true that the WHO didn’t develop its own test from scratch, but as we have already relayed, the organization has distributed more than 1 million tests, which is what many people have called ""the WHO test."" (And for the purposes of this article, when we refer to the WHO test or test kit, we are referring to the tests the agency has shipped around the world.)
""The WHO selected this particular test for global distribution as it was modeled on the earliest published PCR protocol,"" a WHO spokesperson told us, referring to the lab technique underpinning all of the molecular assays. The German protocol was first made available on Jan. 13 and announced in a press release on Jan. 16.
On the WHO website, the German test is listed along with designs from six other countries, including the United States’ submission. A disclaimer notes that the order of the listing ""is by country"" and ""does not imply any preference of WHO,"" and that the protocols ""have not yet been validated through a WHO process.""
In other words, as Sampath told us, the WHO hasn’t endorsed a particular test and hasn’t said one is better than another, even though it did choose one to mass produce.
Not a ‘Bad’ Test
That brings us to how well the WHO test performs — and Trump’s false claim that the test was ""bad.""
Trump may have concluded this from the way Birx responded when asked about Biden’s claim. She emphasized quality control of testing kits and said, ""It doesn’t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives.""
False positives are instances in which a test says a person has the disease when a person doesn’t — and should test negative. In the reverse problem, a person who has the disease can test negative when they are actually positive, in what’s called a false negative.
But there is no evidence that the WHO test doesn’t work well. Sampath, whose organization is now testing different COVID-19 assays from various manufacturers to provide independent verification for countries, said there are ""no known issues"" with the test. The WHO’s Ryan also said in a CNN interview that the test has performed ""extremely well in the field, in multiple countries."" 
""The test has been validated in three external laboratories, adapted by WHO and manufactured in line with international quality standards,"" a WHO spokesperson said. ""It has shown consistently good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false-positive nor false-negative results have been reported.""
The White House and the vice president’s office did not respond to our requests for comment or clarification. But Birx told the New York Times that the test she alluded to with a 47 to 50% false positive rate was not the WHO test, but rather a diagnostic used in China. 
A study there found that 47% or more of people who didn’t have symptoms and had been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 might have been improperly flagged as having the disease. The paper, however, has been retracted, and the English-language abstract didn’t report the test’s overall false positive rate.
NPR reported the retraction after FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn referenced the study again in an on-air interview. According to NPR, the retraction occurred a few days after publication on March 5. The retraction was not indicated on PubMed, the National Library of Medicine’s biomedical literature database, until March 26.
Updated, March 24: We added a video to this story. 
Updated, March 27: We have updated this story to include information about the retraction of a Chinese study about a COVID-19 diagnostic test. When we published our story on March 20, and even after we updated it on March 24, PubMed had yet to indicate that the paper had been retracted.

      Trump’s H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic Spin

		In tweets and other appearances, President Donald Trump has repeatedly compared his response to the new coronavirus with President Barack Obama’s handling of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. But Trump’s information is frequently incorrect or misleading — and the two viruses are very different.
In a March 4 telephone interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, for example, Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration ""didn’t do anything"" about the 2009 pandemic.
Trump, March 4: Well, I just say that it’s, you know, a very, very small number in this country. And we’re going to try and keep it that way as much as possible. I will say, though, the H1N1, that was swine flu, commonly referred to as swine flu. And that went from around April of ’09 to April of ’10, where there were 60 million cases of swine flu. And over — actually, it’s over 13,000. I think you might have said 17. I had heard it was 13, but a lot of — a lot of deaths. And they didn’t do anything about it. Interestingly, with the swine flu, children were — in particular, they were vulnerable, sort of the opposite in that respect. But children were very vulnerable to the swine flu. But they never did close the borders. I don’t think they ever did have the travel ban. And we did. And, again, they lost at least 13,000.
In a March 12 meeting with the prime minister of Ireland, Trump repeated the sentiment. 
""If you go back and look at the swine flu, and what happened with the swine flu, you’ll see how many people died, and how actually nothing was done for such a long period of time, as people were dying all over the place,"" he said. ""We’re doing it the opposite. We’re very much ahead of everything.""
Trump is correct on the number of H1N1 cases and deaths, but it’s misleading to compare those figures to the current outbreak of COVID-19, which has just begun. It’s also not true that the Obama administration did nothing or waited a long time to act on the H1N1 influenza pandemic.
In 2009, a new H1N1 influenza virus cropped up out of season, in late spring. Because of genetic similarities to influenza viruses in pigs, it became known as a ""swine flu,"" even though there is no evidence the virus spread between pigs or pigs to humans.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were about 60.8 million cases of infection with the novel type of influenza virus in the U.S. between April 2009 and April 2010, with a total of approximately 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths.
While that death toll may sound high, it’s over an entire year and, in fact, ended up being far lower than was initially expected. The strain of influenza also turned out to have a case fatality rate of just 0.02% — well below even many typical seasonal influenzas.
Everything that’s known about the new coronavirus so far suggests that it’s an entirely different beast than its most recent pandemic predecessor. Peter Jay Hotez, a professor and dean of the tropical medicine school at Baylor College of Medicine, told us that the new virus, which is known as SARS-CoV-2, is considerably more transmissible and more lethal than H1N1.
For those reasons, he said, ""the urgency to contain this coronavirus is so much greater than the H1N1 2009 one was.""
In the Hannity interview, Trump touted his travel restrictions and noted that Obama ""never did close the borders."" Paul A. Offit, chair of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that Trump’s travel restrictions bought the U.S. time to react, but he said it didn’t make any sense to impose travel restrictions in 2009 since the H1N1 was first reported in North America and the flu is ""hard to stop."" 
""I don’t think it is a fair comparison,"" Offit said. ""The flu is constantly mutating – it usually happens in pig and humans in southeast Asia – it is really hard to stop that. Unless you ban all travel anywhere in the world to the United States you would have had trouble. That is true with all flu pandemics. I don’t think a travel ban would have ever made a difference.""
Contrary to Trump’s suggestion that the Obama administration did ""nothing,"" officials declared a public health emergency early in the H1N1 outbreak, secured funding from Congress and ultimately declared a national emergency, as we’ll explain below. 
On top of that, the CDC sequenced the new virus, created testing kits, and the Food and Drug Administration approved multiple vaccines, among other actions.
Rep. Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas, praised the CDC at a House hearing in 2016 for quickly developing a vaccine for the swine flu in about six months — in time for the start of the school year in September 2009. ""So that’s a 6-month time frame if I’m doing my math correctly that you were able to identify the genetic sequence of the virus, reverse engineer a vaccine, test it, assure its safety and efficacy, and get it to school teachers on the second week of school. That’s pretty impressive,"" he said.  
Trump said in a tweet that the Obama administration’s response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic ""was a full scale disaster."" While he can have that opinion, there is little to support such a negative view. 
A New York Times article from January 2010 said that while some mistakes were made, a variety of experts thought the administration had generally handled things well.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine told the Times that officials deserved ""at least a B-plus,"" while Mount Sinai virologist Peter Palese called the overall response ""excellent.""
Obama’s Emergency Declarations
In one tweet, Trump quoted Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs as misleadingly claiming that it ""took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency"" for the H1N1 ""swine flu"" outbreak that ""killed 12,000 Americans."" It’s true that Obama didn’t declare a national emergency for six months, but that ignores several other steps the administration took, including declaring a public health emergency the same month that the novel H1N1 infections were first reported.
At the time of the tweet, Trump had not yet declared a national emergency for COVID-19.
(Dobbs’ actual quote was slightly different. He said on his March 12 show that it ""took six months for President Obama to then declare a national emergency, one that ultimately killed more than 12,000 Americans and infected 60 million more."")
On April 15, 2009, the first infection was identified in California, according to the CDC, and less than two weeks later, on April 26, 2009, the Obama administration declared a public health emergency. The day before, on April 25, the World Health Organization had declared a public health emergency.
Dr. Richard Besser, then-acting director of the CDC, confirmed to the press on the day of the U.S. declaration that there were 20 cases of H1N1 in the U.S., and that ""all of the individuals in this country who have been identified as cases have recovered.""
The same day — April 26 — the CDC began releasing antiviral drugs to treat the H1N1 flu, and two days later, the FDA approved a new CDC test for the disease, according to a CDC timeline on the pandemic.
On April 30, 2009, two days after the public health emergency declaration, Obama formally asked Congress for $1.5 billion to fight the outbreak, and later asked for nearly $9 billion, according a September 2009 Congressional Research Service report. On June 26, 2009, Obama signed Congress’ supplemental appropriation bill that included $7.7 billion for the outbreak.
The U.S. public health emergency was renewed twice — on July 24, 2009, and Oct. 1, 2009.
The WHO declared H1N1 a pandemic on June 11, 2009. Obama declared a national emergency related to the pandemic on Oct. 24, 2009. At the time, the CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, had said millions of people had been infected in the U.S. and more than 1,000 had died. Also about 11.3 million doses of H1N1 vaccine had been distributed, he said.
A month later, on Nov. 12, 2009, the CDC published a report that estimated there had been between 14 million and 34 million H1N1 cases between April 17 and Oct. 17, 2009, and 2,500 to 6,000 H1N1-related deaths.
The H1N1 2009 flu pandemic ultimately did kill 12,000 Americans — the figure Dobbs used — according to the midrange estimate from CDC for April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010. The number of cases totaled an estimated 60.8 million people. To be clear, that strain of the flu continues to cause infections and deaths, at least 75,000 deaths from 2009 to 2018, the CDC says.
In the case of that pandemic, the outbreak began in Mexico and spread quickly to the United States. The first cases in Mexico were identified in March and early April 2009, with the Mexican government reporting an outbreak to the Pan American Health Organization on April 12, 2009, according to a CDC report.
In the case of COVID-19, the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, China, and officials reported an outbreak to the WHO on Dec. 31. The CDC announced the first American case on Jan. 21. The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31, one day after the WHO did so, and announced a national emergency on March 13. Two days before, the WHO had declared the global outbreak a pandemic. 
Trump Misleads on Polls Again
In yet another tweet, Trump again misleadingly cited poll information to claim he has ""78%"" approval of his administration’s response to the new coronavirus outbreak.

Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2020

 
He claimed this was ""the highest on record,"" while Biden’s approval rating for the response to the H1N1 outbreak ""was lowest."" Even according to a dated poll, the H1N1 approval wasn’t the lowest.
As we’ve written before when the president cited Gallup, a poll by the company, taken Feb. 3-16 and released Feb. 20, before anyone had died from COVID-19 in this country, found that 77% of Americans were very or somewhat confident that the government would be able to handle an outbreak of new coronavirus. That was a higher percentage than American confidence in previous administrations’ ability to deal with Zika, Ebola, swine flu and bird flu, according to an average of polls. But the confidence in swine flu was the second highest — at 67% — not the ""lowest,"" as Trump claimed.
And as the number of cases and deaths have grown, public confidence in the Trump administration has decreased, according to several polls. A Quinnipiac poll, taken March 5-8 and released March 9, found 43% of registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling the outbreak response.
With the swine flu, however, at least two polls showed higher approval of the Obama administration (the polls didn’t ask about Biden). A Washington Post-ABC News poll taken in October 2009 found 69% of adults were confident in the federal government’s ability to respond to an outbreak. A CNN poll released in early November 2009 found 57% approved of Obama’s response.
Also, Trump may have given Biden a promotion, claiming he ""was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic."" When we asked the Biden campaign about that, we were told that the former vice president ""helped lead"" the response to the pandemic ""but was not the top official for it.""

		A senior aide to President Joe Biden misleadingly claimed that congressional Republicans ""defunded the police"" when they voted against the American Rescue Plan Act. House and Senate Republicans didn’t support the legislation, but it wasn’t a vote to cut or eliminate federal funding for law enforcement, as the claim may have led viewers to believe.
Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser to the president and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, made the claim during a June 27 interview on ""Fox News Sunday."" He was asked to respond to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham’s statement that Biden’s proposed plan to address rising crime across the country would not work because a ""declared war on the police"" was ""backfiring on those who have done it.""
""Senator Graham doesn’t have a clue. And let’s talk about who defunded the police,"" Richmond said, referring to the controversial concept of terminating or shifting funds away from police budgets that some Democrats and activists embraced in 2020 after a Black man, George Floyd, was killed by a white police officer.
""When we were in Congress last year trying to pass a rescue plan … an emergency relief plan for cities that were cash-strapped and laying off police and firefighters, it was the Republicans who objected to it. And in fact, they didn’t get funding until the American Rescue Plan, which our plan allowed state and local governments to replenish their police departments and do the other things that are needed.""
""So, look, Republicans are very good at staying on talking points of who says defund the police. But the truth is, they defunded the police. We funded crime intervention and a whole bunch of other things,"" Richmond continued.
Richmond was referencing the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that Biden signed into law on March 11, as the U.S. economy continued to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. That bill passed in both houses of Congress with only Democratic support. It provided additional recovery money to lower-level governments, which could spend some of the money for law enforcement. But there was no requirement to do so. 
Richmond’s claim suggested that Republicans voted to cut or reduce existing federal funding to police departments — which is what some who truly want to ""defund the police"" advocate. That’s not what happened.
Additional Recovery Funds
The American Rescue Plan included hundreds of billions in additional economic relief for individuals and small businesses, including direct stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits. Among other things, it also provided over $350 billion in emergency funds to help state, county, city and tribal governments make up for revenue that was lost during pandemic-related shutdowns.
When the bill passed in a 50-49 Senate vote on March 6, Biden said it meant that ""states and local governments that have lost tens of thousands of essential workers"" because of layoffs would now ""have the resources they need available to them, to those laid-off police officers, firefighters, teachers and nurses they can rehire."" And after Biden signed the bill into law on March 11, national police organizations also touted the emergency funding available to lower governments to maintain public safety services.
However, the section of the bill outlining the ""Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds"" did not stipulate that the relief funding had to be used on police officers or for other law enforcement initiatives.
This is how a March 18 Treasury Department fact sheet summarized the recovery fund: ""The Rescue Plan will provide needed relief to state, local, and Tribal governments to enable them to continue to support the public health response and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable economic recovery. In addition to helping these governments address the revenue losses they have experienced as a result of the crisis, it will help them cover the costs incurred due responding to the public health emergency and provide support for a recovery – including through assistance to households, small businesses and nonprofits, aid to impacted industries, and support for essential workers. It will also provide resources for state, local, and Tribal governments to invest in infrastructure, including water, sewer, and broadband services.""
Even the May 10 fact sheet on the Treasury’s proposed interim final rule on how to use the recovery funds noted that ""recipients have broad flexibility to decide how best to use this funding to meet the needs of their communities.""
GOP Opposition
Also, Republicans in Congress did not say they opposed the legislation because some of the relief funds would potentially go to police departments.
At least one consistent GOP criticism of the overall bill — which we wrote about — was that only a small percentage of it was specifically earmarked for health spending related to COVID-19.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also criticized the total cost of the legislation and said that many states actually had budget surpluses and didn’t really need additional emergency funds.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell similarly denounced the COVID-19 relief bill for including ""completely unrelated left-wing pet priorities,"" as well as ""sending $350 billion to bail out long-mismanaged state and local governments."" He also argued that the bill — at a total cost of nearly $2 trillion — was about the same size as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law near the start of the pandemic in March 2020 and provided about $150 billion in direct assistance to state and local governments.
And when White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was pressed in a June 30 press briefing to name a single Republican who had opposed the bill because of the additional funding for police, she didn’t identify one. Instead, Psaki said: ""So if you oppose funding for the COPS program — something that was dramatically cut by the prior administration and many Republicans supported — and then you vote against a bill that has funding for the COPS program, we can let other people evaluate what that means. It doesn’t require them to speak to it or to shout it out; their actions speak for themselves.""
Psaki was talking about the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which provides federal funding for hiring police officers, as well as nonhiring initiatives such as law enforcement training. As president, Donald Trump did propose cutting COPS funding, but Congress ultimately increased funding for the program throughout his presidency. And while the American Rescue Plan included funding that could be used to rehire or compensate police officers, it wasn’t specifically tied to the COPS program.
White House Response


When we asked the White House about Richmond’s defunding claim — as well as Psaki’s defense of it in press briefings — an official directed us to a June 29 statement that White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates issued to a Fox News congressional correspondent. That statement also pointed to the American Rescue Plan funding to state and local governments, and the COPS program.


""The President ran and won decisively on a platform of increasing funding for law enforcement, against an opponent who not only spent his entire term attempting to cut the COPS program – with the support of congressional Republicans – but who also blocked critical resources needed to prevent the laying off of police officers at a time of rising crime,"" Bates said in the statement, which was published in a tweet. 
""The President, with the backing of leading law enforcement groups, secured the money that his predecessor opposed – to keep cops on the beat – and every single Republican member of Congress voted against it. They continue to oppose the American Rescue Plan even as it delivers the rehiring of police in their districts. The President is also fulfilling his campaign promise of fighting for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding for the COPS program, as a central element of a comprehensive approach to the higher crime rates he inherited, alongside addressing gun violence directly, implementing prevention programs and dealing with root causes.""
The White House official also told us that some Republicans in Congress have suggested that unspent funding authorized for state and local governments could be rescinded or reallocated to pay for other proposals, such as Republican-supported infrastructure plans.
To that point, a June 29 blog post on the website of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — which carried the headline ""House Republicans Vote to Defund Police – Again"" — emphasized that Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee that day voted in favor of an amendment to a funding bill that would stop local governments from receiving the second portion of American Rescue Plan money that is scheduled to be released in 2022.
""What we are talking about is an extremely large amount of money that local governments didn’t ask for, that in many respects don’t need, and to this moment in time don’t even know how they would effectively spend this kind of money,"" said Republican Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who proposed the amendment, which failed in a 23-34 vote. He argued that because ""we’re on the tail end of COVID,"" it would be ""irresponsible"" for members of the committee ""to continue to shovel money out the door"" because of the disease.
The two parties clearly disagree on how much money state and local governments need to recover from the pandemic. However, voting against a bill that includes additional money that may be used to bolster police departments is not the same thing as reducing or redistributing existing federal funding for police, as Richmond’s remarks suggested.

		1""This is a pandemic,"" President Donald Trump said at a March 17 press conference. ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."" 
While it’s not possible to know what Trump ""felt,"" there’s no doubt that Trump had minimized the threat of the new coronavirus for weeks in statement after statement.

Here’s what the president said in public remarks, interviews and tweets from Jan. 22 to March 10 -– one day before the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak a pandemic.
Jan. 22: ""We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine."" — Trump in a CNBC interview.
Jan. 30: ""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you."" — Trump in a speech in Michigan.
Feb. 10: ""Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now."" — Trump at the White House. (See our item ""Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?"")
Feb. 14: ""There’s a theory that, in April, when it gets warm — historically, that has been able to kill the virus.  So we don’t know yet; we’re not sure yet. But that’s around the corner."" — Trump in speaking to National Border Patrol Council members.
Feb. 23: ""We have it very much under control in this country."" — Trump in speaking to reporters.
Feb. 24: ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!"" — Trump in a tweet.
Feb. 26: ""So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck."" — Trump at a White House briefing.
Feb. 26: ""And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done."" — Trump at a press conference.
Feb. 26: ""I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up."" — Trump at a press conference, when asked if ""U.S. schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading.""
Feb. 27: ""It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear."" — Trump at a White House meeting with African American leaders.
Feb. 29: ""And I’ve gotten to know these professionals. They’re incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they’re very, very cool. They’ve done it, and they’ve done it well. Everything is really under control."" — Trump in a speech at the CPAC conference outside Washington, D.C.
March 4: ""[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40-plus people [from a cruise ship]. … We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers. But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States."" — Trump at a White House meeting with airline CEOs.
March 4: ""Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number."" — Trump in an interview on Fox News, referring to the percentage of diagnosed COVID-19 patients worldwide who had died, as reported by the World Health Organization. (See our item ""Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate."")
March 7: ""No, I’m not concerned at all. No, we’ve done a great job with it."" — Trump, when asked by reporters if he was concerned about the arrival of the coronavirus in the Washington, D.C., area. 
March 9: ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"" — Trump in a tweet.
March 10: ""And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away."" — Trump after meeting with Republican senators.
A day later, on March 11, the WHO declared the global outbreak a pandemic. 
Update, March 19: This article was updated to include a video.

		In the more than eight months since the novel coronavirus emerged and then spread around the world, scientists across the globe have made rapid progress on developing a COVID-19 vaccine.
As of Sept. 3, at least 176 vaccines are in the works, with nearly three dozen already in clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization. But until a vaccine is tested in large numbers of people and weighed against a placebo, scientists won’t know if one or more vaccines are safe or effective.
Here, we give an overview of the vaccine development efforts underway and answer some questions about the testing process, the likelihood and timing of a vaccine in the U.S., and what to expect from a COVID-19 vaccine.
How likely is it that there will be a COVID-19 vaccine?
Very likely. Every expert we contacted was confident that there would be a COVID-19 vaccine, although details beyond that are uncertain.
""We should get something that can induce immunity to the virus,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa, in a phone interview. ""The challenge, though, is knowing whether the immunity is long-lasting. And how protective it’ll be.""
""I’m fairly confident we will have several COVID-19 vaccines because the technical hurdles for making a COVID-19 vaccine are not that steep,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of Baylor College of Medicine’s National School of Tropical Medicine, told us, adding that researchers know to target the so-called ""spike"" protein on the outside of the virus.
""This is sort of an old school problem in virology, and we have several vaccines where we’ve done this in the past,"" he said, ""so I’m pretty confident we will have not just one but probably several COVID-19 vaccines.""
Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert and pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us he was ""very confident"" there would be a vaccine, and likewise said he thought there would be more than one.
As he has before, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus task force member and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned in July 31 congressional testimony that ""there’s never a guarantee that you’re going to get a safe and effective vaccine."" 
But, he added, the signs so far are promising. ""From everything we’ve seen now — in the animal data as well as the early human data — we feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this year and as we go into 2021.""
How do coronavirus vaccines work, and what are the various vaccine designs?
As with other vaccines, the basic idea behind a coronavirus vaccine is to train the body’s immune system to recognize the virus, or SARS-CoV-2, so that if a person encounters it, they will either not become infected or will develop a less severe case of the disease.
Exposure to either a tiny amount of the virus — either weakened or killed — or a viral protein prompts the development of immune T and B cells that specifically recognize the virus and spurs the creation of antibodies by B cells, including so-called neutralizing antibodies that can glom onto the virus and prevent the pathogen from entering cells. 
The COVID-19 vaccines in development around the world run the gamut from traditional approaches using killed, or inactivated, virus to never-before-approved genetic vaccines, which are made of pieces of DNA or messenger RNA that correspond to a viral protein. Once injected into the body, the DNA or mRNA is made into the protein, to which the immune system can then react.
For the coronavirus, most vaccine designs that don’t use inactivated or weakened virus target the spike protein, since it coats the outside of the virus and it’s what SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells.
Protein subunit vaccines for COVID-19, for example, are made of the purified viral spike protein, while viral vector vaccines are made of harmless viruses that are modified to contain a gene that codes for the spike protein.
Of the leading candidates being supported by the U.S. government, Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccines are both mRNA-based and are now in phase 3 trials. AstraZeneca’s adenovirus viral vector vaccine, which was developed at Oxford University, became the third vaccine to enter trials in the U.S. on Aug. 31. All three use technology that has never been used in any previously licensed vaccine.
Other candidates include Novavax’s protein subunit vaccine, Johnson & Johnson’s adenoviral vaccine — both in phase 1 testing — as well as Sanofi’s protein subunit vaccine, which is in combined phase 1/2 testing. Merck’s viral vector-based entry, which borrows technology from its Ebola vaccine, is still in preclinical testing.
No American vaccine uses inactivated or weakened virus, and most vaccines being designed require two doses.
What do the data say so far about the U.S. vaccine candidates?
Much of the information that has emerged thus far is promising. Experiments in monkeys have shown that after giving animals one of several experimental COVID-19 vaccines, the animals produce strong immune responses and are either protected from infection or prevented from becoming sick after purposely being infected with SARS-CoV-2.
In the case of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine, some monkeys could still become infected after receiving the vaccine, but the animals quickly cleared the virus from their bodies.
Results from Oxford’s AstraZenca vaccine showed that rhesus macaques getting the vaccine had less virus in their bodies than control animals, and none developed pneumonia.
One of J&J’s vaccine designs performed especially well, with one dose being sufficient to trigger high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protecting five of six monkeys from becoming infected upon challenge.
Early trial results in humans, many of which were initiated before the animal data came in, also look encouraging. Phase 1 trials are typically conducted in fewer than 100 volunteers to assess initial safety and to find the correct dose; phase 2 trials continue monitoring for any safety concerns and look for efficacy in a pool of several hundred participants.
A phase 1 trial of Moderna’s vaccine, which was tested at three dosages in a total of 45 participants, found that after two doses subjects generally produced more neutralizing antibodies than patients who had recovered from COVID-19, with no serious side effects.
Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine showed similar results in an unpublished combined phase 1/2 trial, also in 45 people.
Oxford’s AstraZeneca vaccine sparked a T cell and neutralizing antibody response in participants after one dose, although it elicited more side effects than those experienced by patients who were given a meningitis vaccine as a control.
All 106 participants who received Novavax’s protein subunit vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies, on average about four times the level of those recovering from COVID-19.
The results bode well for an eventual vaccine, but as Offit explained, nothing is certain until there’s data from a phase 3 trial, when the shot goes into the arms of tens of thousands of volunteers and is compared in a randomized controlled trial to placebo.
""Even though we have excellent immune responses"" in the early phase studies, he said, ""it doesn’t necessarily mean these are protective immune responses. The only way that can be known is in a phase 3 trial.""
And he noted that the existing results are in an extremely small number of people — just 15 people for the dose Moderna selected, for example. Ideally, he said, the number of people that you see having a consistent, brisk immune response ""should be more than the number of people you can invite to a small outdoor BBQ.""
A consistent finding across these early trials is that a COVID-19 vaccine may be somewhat more annoying for people than other vaccines. While no serious effects have been observed, most of the vaccines are what scientists call reactogenic, producing tenderness and swelling at the injection site, among other short-term symptoms. 
Especially given the fact that two doses will likely be needed, public health experts say it’s important for people to know going in that the shot isn’t dangerous but may be unusually painful, so they’re not concerned or surprised.
What is Operation Warp Speed?
As we’ve written, Operation Warp Speed is the government’s nearly $10 billion effort to fast-track vaccine development as well as therapeutics and diagnostics. The program’s stated mission is to ""produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021."" 
A key component of OWS’ approach is to offer funding to promising vaccine candidates so that companies can begin manufacturing vaccines even before scientists know that they work, or what’s called manufacturing at risk. 
If trial results are good, the Food and Drug Administration can either license the vaccine or authorize a vaccine for use via an emergency use authorization, which Offit believes is more likely. But if testing reveals a vaccine to be unsafe or ineffective, those doses would be thrown out.
""Rather than eliminating steps from traditional development timelines, steps will proceed simultaneously, such as starting manufacturing of the vaccine at industrial scale well before the demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety as happens normally,"" an OWS fact sheet explains. ""This increases the financial risk, but not the product risk.""
The FDA said in a June guidance document that it expects any vaccine it authorizes to be at least 50% effective at preventing disease or decreasing COVID-19 severity, which is on par or slightly better than the seasonal influenza vaccine.
As of Sept. 4, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, has backed seven different vaccines with either funding for research and development or for manufacturing. 
It’s worth noting that OWS is not unique. Other countries and organizations around the world are taking the same approach, said Dr. Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response under President Barack Obama. Lurie now advises the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to developing vaccines to stop epidemics, including COVID-19.
""All the major vaccine development efforts around the world are trying to do the same thing right now, and the major concept is doing the manufacturing before you do the trials,"" she said in a phone interview.
And while the scale this time is different — both in the U.S. and around the world — Lurie said, making vaccines at risk was done during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, ""so it’s not a new concept.""
The U.S. has declined to participate in the COVAX initiative, which is part of the WHO’s vaccine accelerator program, and is also led by CEPI and the Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. As with OWS, the idea is to bank on multiple candidates to increase the chance of a successful vaccine, but the idea is more ambitious and guards against so-called vaccine nationalism, or countries competing against one another and those of means hoarding vaccines at the expense of poorer nations. 
Under the program, wealthy countries collectively bankroll a much broader portfolio of vaccines than they could support on their own, gaining access to more potentially successful candidates while also ensuring that lower-income nations have access to doses.
When will the U.S. have a safe and effective vaccine?
An exact time frame is impossible to know, despite the president’s insistence that the U.S. ""will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,"" as President Donald Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention.
The CEO of Pfizer said on Sept. 3 that the company had enrolled 23,000 of its minimum 30,000 trial participants. He said Pfizer expected to know by the end of October whether its vaccine works, and would submit the appropriate regulatory paperwork right away.
According to its website, Moderna had enrolled nearly 17,500 participants as of Aug. 28.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began asking states at the end of August to prepare for distribution of a limited number of doses as early as late October or early November, raising the possibility of a vaccine before Election Day.
The agency, however, cautioned that the vaccine distribution scenarios were ""hypothetical"" and might ""evolve as more information is available"" given uncertainties in the vaccine landscape.
Officials have also explained that having a vaccine so soon is improbable. In a Sept. 3 interview with NPR, Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed, said that there is ""a very, very low chance that the trials that are running as we speak could read before the end of October,"" adding that while he thought it was ""extremely unlikely,"" it wasn’t impossible, and so preparation was appropriate.
The head of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, similarly told CNN on Sept. 2 that the CDC guidance was meant to get states to prepare, even if the likelihood of such an early arrival ""is pretty low.""
Slaoui said that he was confident that a vaccine could be ready by the end of the year, with around 25 million doses to start, and enough shots for the entire U.S. population to be immunized by the middle of 2021.
Fauci said in a CNN interview on Sept. 3 that he thought it was unlikely that a vaccine would be ready in October. ""I think most of the people feel it’s going to be November, December,"" he said. ""It is conceivable that you can have it by October, though I don’t think that that’s likely.""
Other experts, however, are skeptical of even those time frames. Offit thinks the beginning of 2021 is more likely, given the logistics of the trials.
""There is no predicting success in science,"" he said. ""They haven’t finished recruiting totally for dose one and you have to wait a month for dose two, and we’re already in September. Then you have to wait two weeks after dose two to really have the maximum immunological effect from those two doses. Then you have to hope that there’s probably 150 people in your placebo group who get sick with COVID-19.""
An independent group known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, Offit said, can peek at the data and see whether a trial can show, statistically, that a vaccine works. That information could be used to end the trial early if the signals are good. But Offit cautioned that such an approach, if not done properly, could jeopardize valuable information about how well the vaccine works in subsets of the population, including people 65 and older and minorities. A vaccine shouldn’t be given to certain groups, he said, until it is shown to be safe and effective for them.
With fewer people tested in a trial, slightly less will also be known about safety, which Offit said is always about reducing — rather than eliminating — uncertainty, since the final word about the potential for rare side effects only comes after vaccine approval with surveillance.
""It all depends on the levels of transmission, where the trials are going on, and it depends on how good the vaccine is,"" CEPI’s Lurie said of vaccine timing. ""So if we test in areas with lots of transmission and the vaccine is good, we might know sooner. Or if the first dose provides some protection, we might know sooner than if we have to wait for two doses. We just don’t know.""
In an interview in late July, Lurie said she thought people were being ""overly optimistic"" and was concerned that it was setting up ""unrealistic expectations"" and raising concerns about whether any vaccine authorization is premature.
On the manufacturing side, she noted, even if vaccine doses are made, it can still take six weeks to get the product into vials or syringes, plus additional time to do sterility testing.
Who will get a vaccine first?
Even with Operation Warp Speed’s efforts to manufacture vaccine doses before knowing whether a vaccine works, health officials acknowledge there won’t be enough doses for everyone to be immunized right away.
Thus, a critical question is who should receive a vaccine first. To answer this question, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has formed a COVID-19 vaccine work group to, among other functions, ""ensure equity in vaccine allocation and distribution."" 
At the request of the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine is also thinking through how to maximize the benefit of a vaccine and the ethics of prioritization when supplies are limited.
According to the National Academies’ Sept. 1 draft report, scientists propose starting with high-risk health care workers and first responders, followed by adults with underlying conditions that put them at a ""significantly"" higher risk, along with older individuals who live in places such as nursing homes. 
In a second phase, vaccines would be distributed to essential workers at higher risk of exposure, teachers and school staff, and older people without other risk factors, among other groups. Young people, children and lower-risk essential workers would get a vaccine in a third phase.
The report notes that while people of color have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, those differences do not seem to stem from biological differences, but rather from systemic racism that leads to ""comorbidities that increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and the socioeconomic factors that increase likelihood of acquiring the infection.""
As a result, the strategy does not explicitly recommend prioritizing certain racial or ethnic groups, but within the identified phases calls for giving priority to certain geographic regions based on metrics of social vulnerability.
In documents sent to states in late August, the CDC said the ""likely"" groups for initial prioritization include members of the ""critical workforce,"" such as health care workers, and staff and residents of long-term care facilities.
While groups are starting the planning now, the exact details of prioritization could change depending on the specific vaccine or vaccines that first become available, and in what quantities.
""There’s no simple answer"" to prioritization, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch, who has done modeling to help determine which strategies would be most beneficial, said in a press call with reporters in mid-August. ""It depends on what your goal is and on the characteristics of the vaccine."" 
If the vaccine can prevent transmission and there is enough of it to inoculate several tens of a percent of the population, then the best way to reduce the number of cases is to vaccinate the groups responsible for transmission, he said. That might include targeting young adults rather than those at highest risk.
But if there are only a limited number of doses and the goal is to reduce deaths, Lipsitch said, then it makes sense to give the vaccine to the elderly, even if the vaccine works less well for them. Of course, if the vaccine is significantly worse at preventing disease in older folks, then that strategy won’t be most effective.
Even obvious-seeming prioritizations might fall by the wayside depending on the particular vaccine in question.
As Lipsitch noted in a presentation before the National Academies on Aug. 7, giving priority to nursing home staff, for example, could actually backfire in certain instances.
""Vaccinating staff works if it stops infection,"" he said. But it’s ""potentially even counterproductive if it purely suppresses symptoms and makes people less easy to identify as carriers.""
A few reports suggest some people infected with the coronavirus don’t produce antibodies against the virus for very long and that some people can become reinfected. Does that mean a vaccine won’t work?
No. 
Several studies have found that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wane shortly after recovery, especially if coronavirus patients had no or only mild symptoms.
While it’s true that people might need to receive booster shots of a COVID-19 vaccine if immunity to the coronavirus does turn out to be less durable, it’s important to recognize that a lack of antibodies doesn’t necessarily mean someone has zero immunity — and not all studies have replicated those findings.
""What really matters is not that you have antibody in your blood, but that the cells that make antibody are still there, so they can charge up immediately if they see the infection,"" said the University of Iowa’s Perlman. 
If those cells are still there, along with other immune cells that recognize the virus, then a person could be infected again if they lack neutralizing antibodies, but they would be far less likely to become seriously ill. 
That’s probably what happened in several reported cases of reinfection, including what’s thought to be the first confirmed case of reinfection in a man from Hong Kong, who had his viruses sequenced to show that he likely was infected on two separate occasions.
The man had a cough, sore throat, fever and headache the first time around, but had no symptoms upon infection a second time nearly five months later. 
""This is no cause for alarm – this is a textbook example of how immunity should work,"" Yale immunologist Akiko Iwasaki said on Twitter. ""While immunity was not enough to block reinfection, it protected the person from disease.""
Slightly more troublesome is another report, as yet unpublished in a peer-reviewed journal, about an instance of reinfection in a Nevada man whose second COVID-19 infection was worse than his first.
But given that this is only one case, it’s unclear how much to make of it. As one of the scientists reporting the Nevada finding said, ""[T]his is a singular finding. It does not provide any information to us with regard to the generalizability of this phenomenon.""
Other experts also recommended against overinterpreting the reinfection case reports. 
E. John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a tweet that although there’s evidence that reinfection can occur, ""it is likely unusual, if not rare,"" and protective immunity ""remains the more likely outcome of infection (and effective vaccination)."" 
Jesse Bloom, a researcher studying viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, also pointed out that reinfection has been documented for influenza and measles — two viral diseases for which there are vaccines.
""[W]e should pay attention to SARS-CoV-2 re-infections, and assess how frequent they are and why they occur,"" he said in a Twitter thread. ""But recall that #SARSCoV2 is the most intensely surveilled virus in history … and humans are highly heterogeneous, so until we know the statistical frequency of these re-infections, they should not alarm us any more than the occasional influenza or measles re-infections do.""

		Contradicting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director and other government officials, President Donald Trump incorrectly said in a press briefing that a coronavirus vaccine would be ""immediately"" available to the general public after an authorization.
Officials expect only a limited number of doses will be available in 2020 — and those will be given to prioritized groups. Members of the general public may not be able to receive a shot until well into 2021.
The president also claimed, without evidence, that the U.S. would ""be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020.""
Trump made his remarks in a Sept. 16 press briefing. Earlier in the day, Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC, testified before the Senate, explaining the phased rollout.
Redfield, Sept. 16: I think there will be vaccine [that’ll] initially be available sometime between November and December, but very limited supply and will have to be prioritized. If you’re asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we’re probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter 2021.
When asked about Redfield’s comments, Trump said Redfield was mistaken and may have been confused by the question.
""I think he made a mistake when he said that. It’s just incorrect information,"" Trump said. ""No, we’re ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced, and it could be announced in October. It could be announced a little bit after October. But once we go, we’re ready.""
Later, when pressed on when the vaccine would be available to the general public, Trump incorrectly said that it would be available ""immediately.""
Trump, Sept. 16: I would say that — yeah, we will start distributing it immediately.
Reporter: But to the general public.
Trump: To the general public, very shortly there — I mean, really, to the general public: immediately. When we go, we go. We’re not looking to say, ""Gee, in six months, we’re going to start giving it to the general public."" No, we want to go immediately. No, it was an incorrect statement.
The president insisted that ""it’s going to be a much faster distribution than"" Redfield said.
""Our distribution is going to be very rapid and very — it’s going to be all-encompassing,"" he said. ""We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems — senior citizens, et cetera — but it’s a very powerful — it’s a — it’s going to be very powerful distribution. It’s going to cover everybody, and it’s going to cover them rapidly.""
Trump also moved up the timeline for distribution beyond what any expert or official has previously suggested, indicating a possible start as early as mid-October.
""We’re on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner,"" he said. ""We think we can start sometime in October. So as soon as it is announced, we’ll be able to start. That’ll be from mid-October on. It may be a little bit later than that, but we’ll be all set.""
As we have written, experts are doubtful that the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials will have progressed enough to be able to conclude a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of October or early November, let alone begin distribution.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a Sept. 8 interview that having an answer on a vaccine was ""unlikely"" by Election Day, and that a more reasonable expectation would be by the end of the year.
Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed — the government’s effort to fast-track vaccine development — said on Sept. 3 that there was a ""very, very low chance"" that the trials would provide results by the end of October.
Three vaccine makers have started conducting large, placebo-controlled randomized trials of their coronavirus vaccines in the U.S. 
Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine trial is the most advanced, with more than 29,000 enrollees out of a goal of 30,000, as of Sept. 14. Moderna’s trial, which is also testing an mRNA vaccine, is close behind, with more than 25,000 enrollees as of Sept. 16. AstraZeneca’s viral vector vaccine trial was halted after the identification of a possible serious adverse effect in a participant who received the vaccine. The trial has resumed in the U.K. but remains on hold in the U.S. 
The CEO of Pfizer has stated that his company anticipates that it will know whether its vaccine works by the end of October, but that it ""is only a prediction"" and ""only an answer."" Some scientists are skeptical of such a fast turnaround. 
Moderna told CNBC on Sept. 17 that it expects to know an answer on its vaccine in November — and that while one could come in October, it would be unlikely.
Once a company believes it has enough data to justify an authorization, it would need to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration and the agency would have to review it. The authorization could be as fast as a few days if the data are unambiguous. 
Once approved, likely as an emergency use authorization, or EUA, any already produced vaccines would then need to be shipped out. The logistics head of Operation Warp Speed has said vaccines would begin to move to administration sites within 24 hours of the FDA’s decision.
Although that timeline is rapid, it still involves extra days, and makes it even more improbable that vaccine distribution and delivery would occur in October, even if everything goes along without a hitch and a trial does provide results at the end of that month.
As one sign of a reasonable timeline, the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination interim playbook, which the president held up during the presser, doesn’t require states seeking grant funds to even submit their COVID-19 vaccination plans to the agency until Oct. 16.
Perhaps most important, Trump misleads by saying that the distribution plan would get shots to the general public ""immediately"" — and much faster than Redfield suggested.
Some news outlets reported that the CDC issued a statement clarifying that Redfield’s estimates were for when Americans could expect to have completed their vaccinations, not when doses would first be available. Other news organizations said that the agency later retracted the statement.
Regardless, Redfield’s description is consistent with what other officials have said and jibes with the tiered approach the government has proposed.
""We may have enough vaccine by the end of the year to immunize probably, I would say, between 20 and 25 million people,"" Operation Warp Speed’s Slaoui told NPR earlier this month. ""And then we will ramp up the manufacturing of vaccine doses to be able to, based on our plans, have enough vaccine to immunize the U.S. population by the middle of 2021.""
In July 31 Senate testimony, Fauci cautioned that the vaccine would be limited at first. 
""I don’t think that … we will have everybody getting it immediately in the beginning, it probably will be phased in. And that’s the reason why we have the committees to do the prioritization of who should get it first,"" Fauci said. ""But ultimately, within a reasonable period of time, the plans now allow for any American who needs a vaccine to get it within the year 2021.""
The CDC playbook also explains that the vaccine supply will initially be constrained — and that the general public will not have immediate access.
""A key point to consider is that vaccine supply will be limited at the beginning of the program, so the allocation of doses must focus on vaccination providers and settings for vaccination of limited critical populations as well as outreach to these populations,"" the playbook reads. ""The vaccine supply is projected to increase quickly over the proceeding months, allowing vaccination efforts to be expanded to additional critical populations and the general public.""
The document includes tentative scenarios noting that if both vaccines A and B — references to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — were authorized under an EUA, only about 3 million doses, or enough for 1.5 million people to get two doses, would be available by the end of October. By the end of November, the number of cumulative doses could rise to 20 million to 30 million and 35 million to 45 million by the end of December.
Those numbers would mean only a fraction of those prioritized would be able to be vaccinated in 2020, assuming there is a vaccine. Although it’s not known yet exactly which groups will be prioritized — that will be determined only after there is vaccine data — some of the first groups are likely to include health care workers as well as adults with underlying conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 and older individuals who live in places such as nursing homes. 
August meeting slides from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which will provide guidance on which groups should get first dibs, estimate that there are 17 million to 20 million health care workers in the U.S. and some 3 million seniors in long-term care facilities, along with as many as 100 million adults with underlying health conditions.
100 Million Doses?
Notably, neither Slaoui’s estimates nor the CDC numbers fit with Trump’s other claim that ""we’ll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020.""
The Department of Health and Human Services issued a press release the same day as Trump’s remarks and quoted Redfield as using the number, but in a different context. ""Through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, CDC will play a vital role in deciding, based on input from experts and stakeholders, how initial, limited vaccine doses will be allocated and distributed while reliably producing more than 100 million doses by January 2021,"" he said.
But having 100 million doses produced by January is different from having those doses distributed by the close of 2020 — and distribution assumes the vaccine is approved, which is still unknown. Neither HHS nor the White House responded to our inquiry asking about the dose projection.
Pfizer’s website says that if its vaccine receives authorization, the company expects ""to manufacture globally up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021."" Since it’s a global number, that again suggests 100 million doses would not be available to Americans before the year ends. 
The company declined to provide more specific information about its dose number and timeline in the U.S., although the CEO said on Sept. 13 that Pfizer had already manufactured ""hundreds of thousands of doses.""

		The first COVID-19 vaccine to go into any American arms outside of a trial is Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine, which was designed and developed by the German biotech company BioNTech. Here, we give a rundown of basic facts about the vaccine and an overview of how it works.
Quick Summary
Vaccine name: BNT162b2
Design type: mRNA
Dose number: 2, 21 days apart
Efficacy: 95% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults without prior evidence of infection a week or more after receipt of the second dose.
Safety: No serious safety concerns reported other than some rare allergic reactions and a likely, but rare, association with heart inflammation. The shots routinely elicit a fairly strong temporary reaction in many people that can include injection site pain, fatigue, headache and chills.
Expected dose availability: Worldwide, up to 50 million doses, or enough for approximately 25 million people, by the end of 2020, with up to 1.3 billion doses expected in 2021.
Expected timeline: First doses were administered beginning on Dec. 14 to prioritized populations, following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization on Dec. 11.
Operation Warp Speed involvement: No support for the trials or research and development, but the U.S. government inked a $1.95 billion deal in July as part of OWS to buy 100 million doses. In December and February the U.S. announced agreements to purchase another 100 million doses each, for a total of 300 million doses to be delivered by the end of July 2021.
Storage considerations: Ultracold freezer temperatures of -80ºC to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF) for long-term storage, with up to two weeks at standard freezer temperatures; after thawing, vaccine vials can be stored at refrigerator temperatures for up to five days. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the U.S. The companies released promising interim results from a phase 3 trial on Nov. 9, and on Nov. 18 announced a final efficacy of 95% in preventing disease among adults without prior evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Two days later, the company submitted its application to the FDA to receive an emergency use authorization, or EUA, for its vaccine in people 16 years of age and older. The FDA conducted a thorough review — including an analysis of the raw data — of the vaccine’s safety and efficacy, and issued an EUA on Dec. 11.
A day prior to the FDA’s authorization, an outside panel of experts advising the agency also backed the vaccine in a 17 to 4 vote, with one abstention, that based on the evidence available, ""the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older.""
The U.K. authorized the vaccine for emergency use on Dec. 2 and began immunizing people on Dec. 8. Canada authorized the vaccine on Dec. 9.
Pfizer/BioNTech Q&A
What is in the vaccine and how does it work?
As with most other COVID-19 vaccine designs, the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine works by triggering an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which sits on the surface of the virus and is what the virus uses to enter cells.
The vaccine is made of modified messenger RNA, or mRNA, wrapped in a special blend of fatty molecules known as lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make their own spike proteins, prompting the body to generate protective antibodies and activate T cells. The lipids help deliver the RNA into cells and prevent it from being degraded too quickly.
As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained, there is no way to catch COVID-19 from this type of vaccine because the vaccine is not made of a virus. And because the mRNA from the vaccine doesn’t enter the nucleus — the part of the cell that houses DNA — it ""does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA,"" contrary to some online rumors.
How was the vaccine developed?
German company BioNTech designed multiple mRNA vaccine candidates after the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus became public in January and partnered with Pfizer in March.
Early phase clinical trials showed that two leading mRNA designs triggered neutralizing antibody responses that were better than those from people recovering from natural COVID-19 infection, with no serious adverse events. 
But one candidate — BNT162b2, which prompts cells to make a full-length spike protein — did so with fewer side effects than the other. Based on the trial results and preclinical tests, the companies decided to move forward to a combined phase 2/3 randomized controlled trial testing two 30 microgram doses of BNT162b2 on volunteers.
The phase 2/3 trial began in late July, ultimately enrolling around 44,000 people in the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa and Turkey. Enrollment was expanded past the 30,000 initial target in September to include people infected with HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and to add teens as young as 16 years old. In October, the age requirement was lowered to 12 years old. Because of the limited data available on this population, however, Pfizer did not ask to include the 12- to 15-year-old age group in its EUA request.
How effective is the vaccine?
Pfizer announced in a Nov. 18 press release that its vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults without prior evidence of infection, as measured seven or more days after the second dose. The company reported similar efficacy rates across a variety of demographics, including racial and ethnic minorities and older adults.
The trial only looked at whether the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease, not whether the vaccine prevented people from becoming infected or whether the vaccine kept people from transmitting the virus. Additional data from the ongoing trial and other studies may help to answer these questions, as well as how long a vaccinated person is protected, which is unknown. The CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others."" 
Data summarized by the FDA ahead of the advisory committee’s Dec. 10 meeting additionally suggested that disease protection may occur after a single dose, with an estimated efficacy of 82%. But because the trial did not test a single shot, the agency could not reach a conclusion about how well a single dose actually works.
A 95% efficacy does not mean that 95% of people will be protected by the vaccine. Instead, the math is a bit more complicated — and is a relative risk reduction calculation based on 162 cases of COVID-19 occurring in the placebo group and eight in the vaccine group. 
As University of Florida biostatistician Natalie Dean explained in a Twitter thread, a 95% efficacy roughly means a vaccinated person has a 95% reduced risk of becoming sick, compared with a similar person who wasn’t immunized.
Dean also noted that it’s important to differentiate between efficacy, which is the metric used in a clinical trial, and real-world performance as measured in observational studies, which is called effectiveness. It’s possible that outside of the idealized conditions of a randomized controlled trial, the vaccine won’t perform quite as well, although 95% efficacy is still very good. 
The preferred shingles vaccine, Shingrex, for example, has an efficacy of 91.2% in preventing postherpetic neuralgia in people older than 50.
A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in late March 2021, found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.
In terms of the ability of the vaccine to reduce the risk of developing more serious COVID-19 illness, nine cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group versus one in the vaccinated group in the clinical trial.
The FDA briefing document explained that the small number of severe COVID-19 cases ""limits the overall conclusions that can be drawn; however, the case split does suggest protection from severe COVID-19 disease.""
How safe is the vaccine?
No serious safety concerns were reported in the trials. Anyone getting the vaccine, however, should be prepared for unpleasant side effects, including pain, redness and swelling at the site of injection, as well as fatigue, headache, chills and fever.
According to the data released ahead of the FDA advisory committee, these types of reactions were relatively common and tended to be more frequent and severe in younger people.
Underscoring the degree to which these should not be underestimated by the public, a nurse who participated in Pfizer’s trial and suspects she was in the vaccinated group shared in JAMA Internal Medicine that she had a high fever and felt quite ill for nearly two days after receiving her second shot.
As she noted, these effects were transient and ""a normal sign of reactogenicity signaling an effective immune response"" — in other words, the vaccine doing precisely what it should be doing. But it still caught her off guard because she wasn’t warned about it — and she counseled physicians and others to communicate that these responses are expected, so vaccine recipients are prepared.
Serious adverse events, which refer to potentially life-threatening or disabling events, occurred in fewer than 1% of participants, and at similar rates in those vaccinated and those not. The few instances the FDA considered possibly related to the vaccine in its briefing summary included one case of a shoulder injury and one instance of lymphadenopathy, or swelling of the lymph nodes, following vaccination (nonserious cases of lymphadenopathy affected 0.3% of those vaccinated, above the rate of the unvaccinated).
Among nonserious adverse events, the FDA noted that there were four cases of Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, in the vaccine group, and none in the placebo group. This may not mean anything, as the frequency in the vaccine group was not higher than would be expected in the general population, but the agency plans to recommend monitoring for the condition as the vaccine is rolled out into a larger population.
A limited number of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in the U.K. and U.S. since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine began to be administered. Anaphylaxis refers to a life-threatening reaction that usually occurs within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergic substance. Many, but not all, of these people have a history of past severe allergic reactions.
At this time, the only people the FDA says should not receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are those who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or one of its ingredients. The CDC advises skipping the immunization if you have had an allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol, a form of which is in the vaccine, or polysorbate, which is similar to polyethylene glycol. The agency also recommends consulting with your physician if you have ever had an immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines or injectable therapies.
In a Dec. 12 press briefing, the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Director Dr. Peter Marks said the agency would be monitoring the situation and noted that all vaccine administration sites would be equipped to deal with allergic reactions.
As of Jan. 18, there have been 4.7 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to the CDC. None of these cases has been fatal.
To find out what vaccine ingredient might be triggering these reactions, the NIH is gearing up to conduct a study in which people with a history of severe allergies receive the vaccine under close medical supervision.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may also be linked to an increased risk of rare heart inflammation in young people. In late June, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, or inflammation of the lining around the heart, in teens and young adults.
As of July 6, the agency says there have been 971 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years old or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which are through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, are with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and are more common among males and after the second dose.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, the committee said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.""
Why does the vaccine need to be kept so cold?
The extreme cold is necessary to keep the highly sensitive lipid-encapsulated RNA molecules from degrading. Logistically, this cold chain requirement poses an extra hurdle in distributing the vaccine, since many potential vaccination sites lack the appropriate ultracold freezers and may not have a ready source of dry ice.
Pfizer has tried to mitigate some of these challenges by creating specialized ""thermal shippers"" for its vaccine that will maintain ultracold temperatures for up to 10 days if unopened and can store vials for as long as a month if refilled every five days with dry ice.
On Feb. 25, the FDA also began allowing the vaccines to be shipped or stored at regular freezer temperatures for up to two weeks, following data showing that the doses would remain stable under such conditions.
Rival company Moderna, which also used an mRNA design for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, also requires freezing temperatures, but they are less severe, due to differences in the particular lipid nanoparticles used. The company announced in November that its vaccine should remain stable long-term at standard freezer temperatures and should last for 30 days in a refrigerator.

		Quick Take
A viral post on Facebook claims without substantiation that the ""media"" is running a photo of coffins from a 2017 movie with news stories about the novel coronavirus pandemic in Italy. The picture is actually from 2013; it did appear in the 2017 movie, too, but there’s no evidence it’s being used by credible news organizations now.


Full Story 
Facebook users are spreading a false claim that the ""MSM"" — mainstream media — is using an image from a 2017 movie in its coverage of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The viral post — a screenshot of one user’s text-and-photos post — suggests that the picture, showing rows of coffins, was taken from a 2017 movie and is now being circulated by news organizations as an image related to the outbreak in Italy.
The picture was indeed used in that movie, but it was originally taken in 2013 by an Associated Press photographer. We could find no evidence of news organizations today using it to illustrate the pandemic’s toll in Italy, where more than 12,400 deaths have been reported.
The post claims: ""Ok, Patriots so I’m watching the movie UNLOCKED on Showtime and this scene pops up of coffins lined up and guess where I saw that exact picture… from our MSM telling us that this is ITALY right now because of COVID 19 virus!!"" 
""This movie was made in 2017! It’s on Showtime right now!"" it continues. ""This proves that you cannot trust the Media!!!""
  
Many of the screenshots simply show that the photo appeared on a website for CTV News, a Canadian news organization.
But some larger versions of the post further show that the example cited was actually connected to a CTV story dealing with ""African migrants."" We found that story, which was reported by the Associated Press. It’s from 2013, not 2020, and the caption described the image as showing an airport hangar filled with coffins of African migrants who died in a shipwreck near an Italian island in 2013.
The same picture was indeed used in the movie ""Unlocked,"" which came out four years later. (We checked.)



















Screenshot, ""Unlocked"" movie
So the central claim of the argument — that the ""media"" is currently using the photo in coverage of the novel coronavirus — isn’t supported by the original post, or any evidence we could find.
Reverse image searches on Google and Tin Eye didn’t turn up any recent news coverage using the picture in that context.
Ironically, the fact-checking divisions of two reputable news organizations — Agence France-Presse and Reuters — have debunked claims advanced on social media that similar images from the airport hangar showed coffins for victims of the coronavirus pandemic. The outlets correctly pointed out that the pictures were, in fact, from 2013.
We tracked down the Facebook user who shared the initial claim about the ""MSM"" — and whose profile contains numerous references to the QAnon conspiracy theory — and asked for any examples to back up the claim. We haven’t heard back.

		SciCheck Digest
An Instagram post falsely claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting all pneumonia and influenza deaths as caused by COVID-19. That’s wrong and is based on a misreading of one type of monitoring the agency conducts.

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How lethal is COVID-19?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How lethal is COVID-19?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              It’s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn’t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.
The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the United States as of July 9.
An individual’s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person’s age or health conditions. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is more than 600 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29.

Full Story
A prominent anti-vaccine activist’s post on Instagram is misinforming users about the COVID-19 death toll by offering a misinterpretation of one way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps tabs on the pandemic.
The post, from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., wrongly claims that the ""CDC has officially acknowledged that it has quietly created a new mortality category : PIC, which groups Pneumonia and Influenza and Covid together… and reports them all as Covid deaths.""
""It appears that the new classification gives official imprimatur to a gimmick that CDC adopted early in the pandemic of counting Pneumonia and Influenza deaths as COVID in order to inflate mortality numbers,"" Kennedy wrote.
Paired with his claim was a screenshot of part of a CDC web page focused on COVID-19 surveillance that does look at pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
But Kennedy’s post — which accrued nearly 10,000 likes before it was deleted and has been re-posted by others on Instagram and Facebook — is wrong.
""[N]owhere on the CDC or NCHS sites does it say that CDC is counting all PIC deaths as COVID-19 deaths,"" Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email statement. ""This is not true. Only the COVID-19 deaths are counted as COVID-19 deaths.""
He pointed out that the CDC’s provisional death count for COVID-19 distinguishes between deaths attributed to COVID-19 and a category of deaths that includes pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19.
The provisional death data runs on a lag, so the last few weeks’ worth isn’t complete. But, as of an update Dec. 16, the provisional death count reported 276,061 deaths attributed to COVID-19 between Feb. 1 and Dec. 12. That’s compared to 423,212 deaths attributed to either pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 in that same period.
So Kennedy’s post is wrong that the CDC is simply reporting ""them all as Covid deaths."" If that was true, the reported COVID-19 death count would be much higher.
The CDC’s measure at the root of the claim — one that looks at pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 together — is one that has a public health rationale and that is consistent with past practices, experts told us.
The CDC has for years monitored deaths of pneumonia and influenza together as one measure of the flu’s mortality — as archived CDC pages, such as one from January 2016, show. Influenza can cause pneumonia, and so can the novel coronavirus.
""The PIC category was created as a surveillance indicator to monitor COVID-19 mortality, in the same way that we have used combined pneumonia and influenza deaths, for many years, to monitor influenza mortality,"" Anderson said. ""Pneumonia tends to fluctuate in response to and along with influenza (and COVID-19). This is particularly useful where influenza (or COVID-19) mortality is underreported.""
Alex Washburne, a researcher who has studied the prevalence of the novel coronavirus by analyzing data on influenza-like illnesses, told us in an email that the ""CDC’s mortality surveillance is a kind of ‘syndromic surveillance’ similar to their influenza-like illness surveillance, and it’s a way to obtain very useful glimpses of disease burden from a somewhat clunky US health system.""
It makes sense that public health officials would use this surveillance as one way to monitor the pandemic, since there are several diagnosis codes that a doctor may use for a patient with COVID-19 symptoms — especially if a test result isn’t available — said Washburne, now chief scientist and epidemiological consultant at Selva Analytics. For example, a patient might be recorded as having ""pneumonia of unknown cause.""
Washburne also said the PIC category ""is a useful dataset for disease burden due to respiratory pathogens, which itself is likely a useful category for understanding disease control & prevention (e.g. social distancing and mask-wearing may affect many respiratory pathogens).""
Dr. Justin Silverman, a Penn State assistant professor in the College of Information Science and Technology and assistant professor of medicine who co-authored the aforementioned study with Washburne, agreed. He told us in a phone interview that the PIC metric could be useful for multiple reasons, including ""to get a sense of, are we missing COVID deaths?""
But, Silverman said, ""no one’s being misled, it’s incredibly obvious"" — noting that the CDC’s references to the PIC count are clearly labeled as such.

		Quick Take
A viral image on social media is spreading a fabricated quote attributed to President Donald Trump. There’s no evidence the president ever said that doctors have ""never seen a body kill the Coronavirus like my body,"" and that they ""tested my DNA and it wasn’t DNA. It was USA.""

Full Story 
President Donald Trump has touted what he deems a quick recovery from COVID-19 days after he publicly announced that he was diagnosed with the disease.
But a viral image repeatedly shared by tens of thousands, in posts across social media platforms, falsely claims the president said: ""The doctors said they’ve never seen a body kill the Coronavirus like my body.""
""They tested my DNA and it wasn’t DNA,"" the bogus quote continues. ""It was USA.""
There’s no evidence he ever said that.
The image was shared in a tweet Oct. 6 — which was retweeted more than 100,000 times — in which the user wrote, ""this man literally just said he was built different."" It spread widely on Facebook, too — where one popular post claimed, ""Trump really said"" it — as well as on Instagram.
Some commenters wrote that they took the image to be an obvious joke.

The quote is formatted to appear as closed-captioning text for a video address that Trump recorded while in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and shared in an Oct. 3 tweet.
A review of that four-minute video shows he never made the statement falsely attribute to him.
Joel Luther, an associate in research at the Duke Reporters’ Lab, found that the image was part of a set that was posted on Reddit on Oct. 6. It appeared in forums dedicated to memes and political humor.
A subsequent meme in the set fictitiously quotes Trump as saying, ""They said if Joe Biden had this virus his body would’ve died several times by now.""
As we’ve previously explained, Trump did make exaggerated statements in that Oct. 3 video, including about the treatments he received for COVID-19, which he likened to ""miracles.""
But he didn’t say the quote being widely shared on social media.

		Quick Take
Facebook posts are using out-of-context photos to suggest Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, are not abiding by public health recommendations regarding face masks. The photos are from early March, before face masks were recommended by federal health officials.

Full Story 
Democrats gathered virtually for the Democratic National Convention this week in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But as the remote event took place, thousands of Facebook users shared old, out-of-context photos of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, with a false suggestion that the candidates are holding rallies flouting public health guidance.
The posts show photos of Biden and Harris — along with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Sen. Cory Booker — together on stage at a crowded campaign rally. No one is wearing face masks.
""Notice! No Masks. Your Being Played!!!"" reads the text in some of the memes. Another claims: ""Not a mask in sight. Tell me again why we are being forced to wear one.""
The photos are actually from a rally held in a high school gym in Detroit on March 9, as a C-SPAN video shows. The event took place shortly after Harris ended her own presidential bid and endorsed Biden.
At the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not recommend the use of face masks by the public except for those who were sick or treating someone who was ill. The agency in April issued new guidance recommending cloth face masks be worn in public settings to help curb the spread of the disease.
On March 13, days after the Biden campaign event, President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The same day, Michigan announced a temporary prohibition on large gatherings.
On April 24, Whitmer issued an executive order requiring the use of face coverings in ""enclosed public spaces.""
Biden recently called on governors to issue a three-month mandate on wearing masks outdoors and also proposed a national mask mandate during his convention speech.

		President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have made competing claims about Biden’s early statements on the coronavirus.
Following the disclosure of comments he made to journalist Bob Woodward in March about downplaying the coronavirus, Trump has tried to turn the tables on Biden, claiming it was Biden who maintained through late February that the coronavirus was ""not even going to be a problem."" That’s not accurate.
The former vice president warned early about the potential danger posed by the virus, and about the need for a thoughtful response by the federal government. The ""coronavirus is a serious public health challenge,"" Biden said at a Feb. 28 campaign rally in South Carolina.
Conversely, Biden stretched the facts at a CNN town hall on Sept. 17, claiming that in January he wrote an op-ed ""saying, we’ve got a pandemic. We’ve got a real problem."" The op-ed did not go that far. 
We reviewed all of Biden’s public comments that we could find in early 2020 about the coronavirus.  While some of his comments about the potential danger of the virus have proved prescient, Biden was not as far ahead of the curve as he sometimes makes it seem when it came to calls for deterrents like social distancing and wearing masks.
We start with one comment from Biden via Twitter from October 2019, before the coronavirus emerged.


That was more than a month before the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, China, and more than two months before Chinese officials  reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.
Sounding the Alarm
The first public statement that we found from Biden about the coronavirus came in an op-ed for USA Today on Jan. 27. In it, he warned about the ""possibility of a pandemic,"" writing that while there were only five confirmed cases in the U.S. at that time, ""There will likely be more.""
Biden argued that ""Trump’s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge."" Biden touted the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak, and he criticized Trump for proposing budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for International Development (although Congress did not enact those proposed cuts).
That puts Biden on record as sounding an early warning about the coronavirus. But Biden went too far with comments at the CNN town hall when he said he warned in the op-ed, ""We’ve got a pandemic. We’ve got a real problem.""
Biden was responding to recently revealed comments Trump made to Woodward on Feb. 7 acknowledging the coronavirus was ""deadly stuff,"" adding that it might be five times more lethal than the flu.
Trump ""knew the detail of it,"" Biden said. ""He knew it in clear term. Imagine had he at the State of the Union [on Feb. 4] stood up and said, when back in January, I wrote an article for USA Today saying, we’ve got a pandemic. We’ve got a real problem. Imagine if he had said something. How many more people would be alive?""
But as we’ve written, Biden didn’t say in the op-ed that the outbreak was already a pandemic. He said it was a ""possibility."" He said Trump was not prepared to lead the country through a ""global health challenge,"" which Biden did predict would ""get worse before it gets better."" (The World Health Organization didn’t declare COVID-19 a pandemic until  March 11.) In fact, a month after that op-ed, Biden still said it wasn’t yet a pandemic. ""Folks, we can beat this virus. We can keep it from being a pandemic,"" Biden said at a a campaign rally on Feb. 28. ""But it takes a lot of work.""
Four days after Biden’s op-ed, on Jan. 31, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S. But there were exceptions for permanent residents and the immediate family members of both U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
That same day, at a campaign event in Fort Madison, Iowa, Biden said, ""We have right now a crisis with the coronavirus,"" and warned that Trump was not a leader up to the challenge.
Biden, Jan. 31: America needs a president they can trust, especially at times of a crisis. You know, we have right now a crisis with the coronavirus, emanating from China. A national emergency, you know, worldwide alerts. The American people need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. In moments like this, this is where the credibility of a president is most needed, as he explains what we should and should not do. This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.
(Trump has repeatedly cited the ""xenophobia"" comment as evidence that Biden opposed his decision to impose travel restrictions on China. The Biden campaign on April 3 said Biden supported the travel restrictions, and that the xenophobia comment was unrelated to them.)
The following day, Biden tweeted: ""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus."" And he warned Trump was ""the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.""
Biden made nearly identical comments that day at a rally in North Liberty, Iowa.
Biden said Trump had a credibility problem with the American people, who are ""finding it harder and harder to believe what he says about this virus. Look, president’s words matter. They matter, no matter who the president is. And in times of fear and concern, people need to have confidence in the word of a president. And, you know, this president, he has a trust deficit that is compounded by his record of hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering.""
In both rallies, Biden accused Trump of proposing ""draconian"" cuts to the NIH, CDC and U.S. Agency for International Development — which, as we said, Congress ignored.
In some 35 public appearances at campaign rallies, in television interviews or in Democratic debates over the next three weeks in February, Biden was not asked about and did not mention the coronavirus at all.
The issue next came up during a Democratic debate on Feb. 25. With the virus reaching a turning point, as the CDC warned schools they should prepare and might have to close, Biden was asked what he would do. Biden again talked about the Obama administration’s response to Ebola in the context of what he would do now: set up a White House office for pandemic response and increase funding for the CDC and NIH. And Biden said he would insist that China allow American scientists in to ""know what’s going on.""
At a press briefing the following day, Feb. 26, Trump made several comments that suggested the U.S. had the coronavirus well under control.
""So we’re at the low level,"" Trump said. ""As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.""
Trump insisted that ""we’re going very substantially down, not up"" in the number of cases, that ""when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.""
In a CNN town hall that night, Biden said Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did not appear to be on the same page.
Biden called the virus ""a concern"" and said, ""I think it’s important that we understand that you have to have a president in charge. … We need to invest immediately. We should have done it from the beginning, the moment the virus appeared. But we’re getting late, but we’ve got good scientists. And I just hope the president gets on the same page as the scientists.""
The Bogus Case that Biden Played Down the Coronavirus
Earlier this month, a new book by Woodward revealed that on March 19, Trump told Woodward that he had understated the threat of coronavirus on purpose. ""I wanted to always play it down,"" he said, adding, ""I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.""
In recent interviews, Trump has tried to suggest that it was Biden who downplayed the coronavirus.
In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Sept. 9, Trump claimed that Biden ""was going around for many, many weeks"" after the travel restrictions on China were announced on Jan. 31, ""saying, it’s not even going to be a problem. … And they were all going around, no problem, no problem, everybody, practically everybody. Nobody had any idea it would be as violent as it turned out to be."" Later, Trump said Biden ""didn’t think it was going to be a problem until months later. He was way late.""
At a White House briefing the following day, Trump again claimed that for months after he imposed the China travel restrictions, Biden ""said there’s no problem.""
At the ABC News town hall on Sept. 15, Trump again claimed that as late as March, Biden was calling the coronavirus ""totally over exaggerated.""
As we said, that is belied by Biden’s repeated warnings, starting with the op-ed on Jan. 27, that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic, and would require a sustained and strong federal response.
The Trump campaign said the president’s comment refers to statements Biden made on Feb. 28 that it was not a time to panic. (Trump told Woodward that he played down the virus because he didn’t want to create a panic.)
The first was at a campaign rally in Sumter, South Carolina.
Biden, Feb. 28: I want to talk a moment about the coronavirus. And I just want to say a few things to set the record straight. Barack and I, as president and vice president, we took on the virus that was threatening all of Africa and the rest of the world, and we set up a mechanism that worked. But I want to take a moment to say, it’s not a time to panic about coronavirus, but coronavirus is a serious public health challenge.
Biden did say it was not a time to panic, but he never downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus threat, as Trump suggests. To the contrary, he claimed moments later that that’s what Trump was trying to do.
""Trump thought that his upbeat tweets could somehow stop the coronavirus,"" Biden said. ""Well I have news for Donald Trump, like the rest of us, this virus is not impressed by his tweets. And here’s the point, and I’m being deadly earnest about this, we need real action in the White House, not more lies. It’s no surprise that the president who thinks that climate change is a hoax also thinks that coronavirus is a conspiracy. We need a president who stands for the truth over fiction, and facts and science over fiction. Folks, we can beat this virus. We can keep it from being a pandemic. But it takes a lot of work.""
At a campaign event in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the same day, Biden again said ""there should be no panic about this."" But he didn’t downplay the virus, or say that it was ""not even going to be a problem"" or that it was ""totally over exaggerated,"" as Trump claimed. (Starting at the 105:20 mark.)
""There should be just the straight facts laid out for people and now that’s not happening,"" Biden said. ""Hopefully the pressure is building on the president to step aside. He knows nothing about much. He knows nothing about this issue. Let science dictate the outcome,what we do. That’s what I’d be doing.""
That’s different from what Trump was saying at the time. As we recently learned, Trump admitted he was purposefully downplaying the virus.
Interestingly, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on March 24, five days after Trump made his comments to Woodward about downplaying the virus, Biden said this: ""The American people have never, ever, ever, ever let their county down when given an opportunity to respond. And we just have to level with them. They’re tough. They’re smart. They can handle it. But give them the facts. The only thing that’s going to make things worse, if we, in fact, don’t give them the facts, and then things turn out to be bad. Then who do they believe? What is there to believe? They can handle whatever comes their way.""
Social Distancing and Masks
While Biden may have been earlier than many in warning about the potential seriousness of a pandemic, he and his campaign have occasionally made comments that suggest he was further ahead of the curve than he was on things like social distancing and wearing masks.
For example, in a TV interview in Florida on Sept. 15, when asked how he would handle a new surge in the coronavirus, Biden said, in part, ""I would be setting the example that I’ve tried to set since this began, of being responsible, wearing a mask."" (Starting at the 1:46 mark.)
Another example is a radio interview in May when Biden talked about a Columbia University study that concluded tens of thousands of deaths would have been avoided if social distancing and other enforcement measures, such as stay-at-home orders, had been widely implemented in the U.S. a week or two earlier. ""They pointed out that if he had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with this virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead,"" Biden said.
At the Sept. 17 CNN town hall, Biden again cited the Columbia study and claimed that ""all the way back in March, I was calling for the need for us to have masks.""
As we wrote back in May, we couldn’t find any examples of Biden calling for social distancing, or something resembling a nationwide lockdown, by early March. 
In fact, Biden was still holding campaign rallies with large groups of people at that point. On March 9, he spoke at a crowded campaign event in Detroit. (Trump’s last public event around that period was a Fox News town hall on March 5.)
On March 12, Biden released ""The Biden Plan to Combat Coronavirus."" It made no mention of public mask-wearing. It called for the CDC to provide clarity to the general public ""about when to move toward social distancing measures, like cancelling school, mass gatherings, and travel and when to move to tele-work and distance learning models.""
In comments posted the same day to Medium, Biden said that while the coronavirus would require a national response, it would also require individuals to ""take appropriate precautions — to protect ourselves, and critically, to protect others, especially those who are most at-risk from this disease.""
""It will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply-ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings,"" Biden said.
The same day, the Biden campaign issued a memo to staff instructing all campaign staffers to work from home, beginning March 14.
On March 16, Trump issued the 15-day ""Coronavirus Guidelines for America,"" in which he urged, ""all Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.""
On ABC’s ""This Week"" on Sept. 13, host George Stephanopoulos noted that in Biden’s op-ed in late January, ""he didn’t explicitly call for travel bans or social distancing or wearing mask.""
Biden campaign Senior Adviser Symone Sanders responded that Biden ""was not being briefed by national security experts who warned him how deadly the virus was. In January and February, Joe Biden did not have the knowledge that President Trump did.""
""But I will tell you that if Joe Biden were president in January or February, he would have taken proper precautions he would have warned the American people,"" Sanders said. ""He would have told folks to social distance. He would model good behavior and wearing a mask.""
We don’t know what national security experts may have been privately telling the president about the coronavirus back in January or February. (It was revealed in April that Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, wrote a memo in late January advising federal officials that the global outbreak could become a pandemic and that more than half a million Americans could die in multiple scenarios.)
But in public statements, Fauci has said Trump did listen to health experts. On April 13, Fauci said that when he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, approached Trump about directing strong mitigation, the president’s response was, ""Yes, we’ll do it.""
In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci said that ""right now at this moment"" the risk from the coronavirus was ""low"" and there was ""no need"" for people ""to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis."" But he added that ""this could change,"" that people needed to be wary of ""community spread,"" and that it could develop into a ""major outbreak.""
In February and March, health experts such as Fauci and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams were still telling the general public not to wear face masks. As late as March 30, the World Health Organization was recommending that healthy people should not wear masks. There was a concern among those health officials at that time that there would not be enough masks available for health care workers.
However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course on April 3 and began recommending that people wear masks in public.
We couldn’t find any instances of Biden ""all the way back in March … calling for the need for us to have masks,"" as he claimed.
The Biden campaign noted that in a press call on March 20, Biden said that when staffers met with him in person, ""We’re following CDC guidelines. People are coming in with masks on, wearing gloves."" And in an interview on March 24, CNN’s Tapper asked Biden how he was keeping himself safe, given that older people are more adversely affected by the coronavirus. Biden responded, in part, ""I’m just following the instructions that — and anybody who walks into the house from the Secret Service on, they’re wearing masks and gloves.""
But that’s not the same as a call for the general public to wear masks.
The Biden camp also points to Biden’s repeated calls in late March for Trump to ramp up the Defense Production Act, and specifically mentioned masks as a critical need. But in those instances, Biden was calling for the need to increase the number of masks available to medical workers to treat those with COVID-19, not for mass public use.
Fauci in late March said the coronavirus task force was discussing whether to advise all Americans to wear masks in public. In a press conference on March 30, Trump was asked about the possibility of such federal guidance, and he said, ""We’re not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time."" And as we said, the CDC made that recommendation several days later, on April 3.
Although Biden was stretching the facts when he said he has advocated public mask-wearing ""since this began,"" he has been a strong advocate since health officials like those at the CDC began recommending it — standing in contrast to Trump, who on the day the CDC issued its guidance, announced, ""I won’t be doing it personally. It’s a recommendation.""
Two days later, on ABC’s ""This Week"" on April 5, Biden had a very different response when asked if he’d be wearing a mask in public.
""Yes,"" Biden said. ""Look, I think it’s important to follow the science, listen to the experts, do what they tell you. It’s, you know, you may not look — he may not like how he looks in a mask, but the truth of the matter is that follow the science, that’s what they’re telling us.""
And, of course, the stance taken by the political rivals has sharply contrasted since.
On April 29, Biden tweeted, ""Wear a mask in public."" And Biden wore a mask on May 25 in his first public appearance in two months. Since then, he has worn a mask in public appearances, and has not held in-person campaign rallies.
By comparison, it wasn’t until July 20 that Trump tweeted a photo of himself wearing a mask. But he has remained inconsistent in his advocacy for mask-wearing. In the ABC News town hall on Sept. 15, Trump noted that health experts working for the government initially ""talked about don’t wear masks, and now they say wear masks. Although some people say don’t wear masks.""
Trump said that he wears a mask ""when I have to and when I’m in hospitals and other locations."" But he added, ""Now there is by the way, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks. There are a lot of people think that masks are not good."" Asked who, Trump gave the example of waiters.
And, of course, Trump has held several rallies with no social distancing, and few attendees wearing masks — including two rallies that were held indoors.
At an outdoor rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in early September, Trump asked a densely packed, mostly mask-less audience if they knew ""a man that likes a mask as much"" as Biden.

""It gives him a feeling of security,"" the president said. ""If I were a psychiatrist, right? I’d say, ‘This guy’s got some big issues.'""

      Biden’s False Claim on Trump’s Response to Coronavirus

		Former Vice President Joe Biden was wrong when he said that the Trump administration made no effort to get U.S. medical experts into China as the novel coronavirus epidemic spread there early this year.
""[W]hen we were talking … early on in this crisis, we said — I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what’s actually happening,"" Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said at a CNN virtual town hall on March 27. ""There was no effort to do that.""
Except that isn’t the case.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to get into China just one week after China reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019.
""On January 6, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a Jan. 28 press conference. ""I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China’s Minister of Health on Monday, and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today. We are urging China: More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response.""
More than a week later, Azar said again at a Feb. 7 press conference that ""our longstanding offer to send world-class experts to China to assist remains on the table."" 
At the time, the New York Times reported, ""Normally, teams from the agency’s Epidemic Intelligence Service can be in the air within 24 hours."" 
The Biden campaign did not respond to our requests for comment.
A team of public health experts from the WHO was allowed by Chinese authorities to visit Wuhan, where the outbreak began, later in February, according to the South China Morning Post. The team included specialists from the United States as well as Germany, Russia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Nigeria.
Biden was correct at the town hall when he said the Trump administration had eliminated a position set up by the Obama administration, in which Biden served, to coordinate the response to pandemics like the coronavirus crisis. But he got the timing wrong, and Trump administration officials say it was a reorganization, with the responsibilities of that office falling to other individuals.
""We set up an office within the White House directly to stay focused on this, in the president — in the White House and — to deal with pandemics,"" Biden said. ""And the first thing this president did, maybe not the first but very first, he eliminated the office, took it out of the White House.""
But it was hardly among the ""first things"" the Trump administration did. It happened well into Trump’s second year in office.
As we reported on March 3 and March 20, the Trump administration did indeed eliminate a key position that would have been involved in pandemic response.
The Washington Post reported that former National Security Adviser John Bolton dissolved the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in May 2018 in a reorganization effort. That’s when Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, who was senior director of the office, left his post. He was not replaced.
According to the Atlantic and the Washington Post, some team members were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of Ziemer’s duties. An NSC spokesman at the time said that the administration ""remains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.""
In a November 2019 report, the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended restoring the global health security position on the NSC as one of seven key changes to better protect the American public from global health threats.
As the discussion continued at the town hall, Biden said, ""And in addition to that, what happened was, we had one person in country who was working — he pulled him out of the country.""
It’s hard to say precisely what the former vice president was referring to as he didn’t complete the thought, and, as we said, the Biden campaign did not respond to our requests for elaboration. Presumably Biden was referring to the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate a public health position in China whose mission was to monitor disease outbreaks in that country, as reported by Reuters last month.
Reuters, March 22: The American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.
""It was heartbreaking to watch,"" said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. ""If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.""
Zhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.
But Quick was not the only U.S. health professional in China, although Reuters reported that the number there had been sharply reduced. The news agency reported on March 25 that the CDC contingent, 47 when Trump took office, has been reduced to 14.
So Biden is hardly alone in criticizing the Trump administration for making moves that may have hampered the response to the coronavirus. But he certainly could be much more precise in his assertions, and he was wrong to say the administration made ""no effort"" to get medical experts into China after the outbreak was reported.

Insurance companies do not deny claims when someone dies after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the American Council of Life Insurers. But a viral social media post has falsely claimed that beneficiaries of a person who dies after getting the vaccine cannot collect life insurance payments.

              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
Three COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and more than 163 million people in the U.S. — nearly 50% of the total population — had received at least one dose of vaccine as of May 25. (See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,"" ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine."")
Despite those numbers, and to the consternation of the U.S. insurance industry, a viral Instagram post has spread the falsehood that beneficiaries can’t collect the life insurance of people who had died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
The post, uploaded by an account called texasseceded, reads: ""My friends aunt recently died from the COVID vaccine. She was denied her life insurance because… she willingly took an EXPERIMENTAL drug.""
We couldn’t determine the veracity of parts of this post — that someone’s aunt died after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or that a life insurance policy was not paid out for some reason. But the implication that life insurance would be denied solely because of vaccination is false.
The American Council of Life Insurers, which represents 280 companies with 95% of the industry assets in the U.S., has been calling out similar bogus claims since March, Whit Cornman, an ACLI spokesman, told us in an email.
""The fact is that life insurers do not consider whether or not a policyholder has received a COVID vaccine when deciding whether to pay a claim,"" Paul Graham, senior vice president for policy development at the ACLI, said in a statement emailed to us on May 21.
""Life insurance policy contracts are very clear on how policies work, and what cause, if any, might lead to the denial of a benefit. A vaccine for COVID-19 is not one of them,"" Graham said.
According to United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group, there are a number of reasons a life insurance payment can be denied, such as lying about your health on an application or if a policyholder dies during the first two years after a policy goes into effect, known as the contestability period.
""Life insurance policies are contracts that specifically state the obligations and rights of the insurance company and the insured,"" Dave Wood, the Martin Chair of Insurance at the Jones College of Business at Middle Tennessee State University, told us in an email. ""Some may limit cause of death to a certain cause (i.e. accidental death or cancer), but traditional policies don’t limit the cause of death. Exceptions include suicide if committed in the first two years after issuance of the policy, and war under some older policies.""
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received unverified reports of more than 4,600 deaths among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an alert system managed by the CDC and the FDA to detect possible safety issues in vaccines.
As we’ve reported, social media posts and websites have improperly cited the raw data from VAERS as evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines cause deaths and serious events. But anyone can submit a report to VAERS, whether or not a vaccine caused the problem. 
""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the CDC said. ""However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.""
As we’ve written, reports of a rare blood clotting condition, mainly in adult women younger than age 50, prompted the FDA and CDC on April 13 to recommend ""a pause in the use"" of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine ""out of an abundance of caution.""  
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted April 23 to resume the use of the J&J vaccine with a warning that it may cause the blood clotting condition. As of May 24, the agencies had identified 32 total cases among more than 10.2 million J&J vaccines administered. There have been three deaths linked to the blood clotting condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
Graham, of the ACLI, told us in an email on May 24 that while his group has had to correct misinformation about insurance coverage in the past, he could not recall a situation like the false claim circulating on Instagram.
""What concerns us about this falsehood is it may be leaving some consumers confused and questioning our commitment to policyholders and their families,"" he said. ""Life insurance is there to protect families financially if the unthinkable should happen.""
As for the vaccine, Graham said people should get it.
""Life insurers encourage all policyholders to maintain healthy habits and lifestyles, and taking preventative measures against COVID-19 is no different,"" he said. ""What’s most important to us is that policyholders know that nothing about the claims process or our commitment to them and their families has changed as a result of the vaccine.""

      COVID-19 Face Mask Advice, Explained

		It’s a seemingly simple question that has divided experts and nations since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak: Should members of the public who aren’t sick use face masks to limit the spread of the disease?
For months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintained that the only people who needed to wear face masks were people who were ill or those who were treating them. That notion stemmed from the idea that basic medical masks do little to protect wearers, and instead primarily prevent sick people from spewing infectious droplets from their noses and mouths. Plus, limited supplies needed to be prioritized for frontline health workers. The World Health Organization agreed.
But some countries took a different tack, suggesting and even requiring the use of masks in certain instances when people were outside their homes. Many scientists, too, began to suggest that a more widespread mask policy might be a good idea.
Then, after days of speculation, President Donald Trump announced on April 3 that the CDC was recommending that people use cloth face coverings in crowded places, even as he emphasized the measure was voluntary and said he would not be following it.
""So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing,"" he said. ""You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it.""
Citing new data that a ""significant portion"" of people infected with the novel coronavirus can spread the virus to others even when they don’t have symptoms, the agency revised its recommendation, saying that people should wear cloth face coverings ""whenever people must go into public settings."" 
""A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others,"" the updated CDC website now reads. ""This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.""
While the tide has turned toward a more pro-mask approach in the U.S., some experts have reservations about the policy. Cloth masks are poorly studied, and there isn’t much real-world evidence to recommend medical masks to the general public. Such guidelines could also exacerbate shortages of medical masks or backfire if people don’t wear their coverings properly or if they are lulled into a false sense of security.
At the same time, other scientists point to lab studies that indicate a broader adoption of masks, even of less effective do-it-yourself models, could still be helpful. And it’s possible widespread mask use could keep people from touching their faces and help convey the severity of the pandemic.
We’ll review some of the research and thinking behind face masks and explain why opinions are divided. But first, it’s important to recognize that despite the debate, on the most important issues, most experts agree:

If there is a benefit to having healthy people mask up, the effect is likely to be small. No one should assume they are protected by a face mask, and it’s critical that people continue to stay six feet away from others and keep washing their hands. As the CDC says, cloth coverings are ""not a substitute"" for social distancing.
Health care workers should receive priority on medical masks, and ideally should be using N95 respirators when treating people with COVID-19.

What Masks Do
Depending on the design, masks can limit the spread of a disease from an infected person in what’s called source control, and/or they can protect the wearer from becoming infected.
In the case of COVID-19, transmission of the virus is thought to occur primarily through respiratory droplets, which can land in other people’s mouths or noses when infected people cough or sneeze. The droplets can also contaminate surfaces that others then touch before touching their faces. 
Here, basic surgical masks — loose-fitting, disposable masks — might be helpful because if someone who is sick is wearing one, their infectious droplets could be trapped in the mask. Doctors and nurses wearing such masks may also be protected somewhat since they’re likely to be coughed or sneezed on.
But researchers also suspect the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can linger in the air in very small droplets known as aerosols, which can be inhaled by people nearby. A study published on March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine called aerosol transmission ""plausible,"" finding in an experiment that the virus ""remained viable"" in machine-generated aerosols for up to three hours, although half of the particles weren’t infectious after about an hour. There’s not a lot of clarity yet about how much of a role this mechanism plays in spreading the virus — and it’s unlikely that this allows the virus to travel long distances — but scientists are increasingly confident that it can happen to some degree. 
""I believe that it is likely that all of the routes of transmission come into play here,"" said occupational health professor Margaret Sietsema of the University of Illinois at Chicago, ""meaning the disease can be inhaled and therefore the best line of defense is a respirator."" 
Respirators include the oft-cited N95 masks, which are disposable, tight-fitting masks that create a seal on the face and include a specialized filter that captures at least 95% of the airborne particles that pass through it. (To avoid confusion, from here on out, we will not refer to any respirator as a mask.) 
In contrast to the N95s, surgical masks are not intended to provide protection against aerosols. As a CDC blog explains, surgical masks ""are designed to provide barrier protection against droplets, however they are not regulated for particulate filtration efficiency and they do not form an adequate seal to the wearer’s face to be relied upon for respiratory protection.""
Limited Evidence, Divergent Views
Sietsema, who recently reviewed the evidence on masks for the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, recommends N95 respirators for health care workers interacting with COVID-19 patients, but doesn’t think there’s enough evidence to support a broader masking policy that includes healthy people.
Masks might be able to reduce transmission by capturing the larger droplets infected people spew, but that only applies if a person is symptomatic, she said, and she argues that anyone with symptoms shouldn’t be in public spaces anyway.
""I do not believe a mask would reduce transmission prior to being symptomatic because air will never choose a path of more resistance (going through the mask) – it will simply go around the mask,"" she said in an email.
She also expressed concern that mask recommendations would lead people to ease up on social distancing and could complicate efforts to preserve surgical masks for frontline health care workers.
Other scientists, however, disagree, and say that while masks won’t be fully effective, they are likely to be better than nothing.
Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, doesn’t buy the idea that surgical masks have no utility for the general public.
""Certainly I could believe they would work /better/ when used by healthcare workers, particularly when used in combination with other protective equipment and behaviors,"" he said in an email, ""but it is a big jump to say they are essential when worn by healthcare workers but useless when worn by others.""
In a just-published study Cowling co-authored in Nature Medicine, researchers found that surgical masks reduced the amount of respiratory virus people expelled while breathing and coughing into a specialized machine.
Previously, another study by Cowling and others using a similar setup found that surgical masks reduced the amount of influenza RNA researchers could detect from both small and larger respiratory droplets. The effect was much stronger for larger droplets, but the study indicates the masks can reduce aerosols to a limited degree.
These types of studies suggest surgical masks can limit the spread of respiratory viruses in theory, but they are still a step away from showing that masks are an effective public health measure in the general population.
After all, in practical use, masks could be detrimental if people let up on social distancing, end up touching their faces more, or if they constantly touch the outside of the mask, which could be contaminated.
Even those who support wider public mask use acknowledge that this type of direct evidence is lacking. In a Lancet Respiratory Medicine commentary article advocating more ""rational"" use of face masks to fight COVID-19, the authors described the available evidence as ""scarce.""
While some studies have evaluated a variety of face masks in hospitals or other heath care contexts, relatively few have tested whether face masks are effective in the community — and the ones that do exist have been inconsistent or have not observed large effects.
Cowling, for instance, told us the best evidence would come from randomized controlled trials, and directed us to his systematic review of 10 trials testing face masks for their ability to limit flu transmission in places such as households or dorms. Although a number of the trials struggled with getting people to actually wear the masks — suggesting that with higher compliance, there might be an impact — the review found ""no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks."" Many of the trials, too, were too small to come to any firm conclusions. 
""Based on the summary of the randomized control trials, there may be some, but not very large, effects,"" said Elaine Shuo Feng, a statistician and epidemiologist at the University of Oxford and the lead author of the Lancet Respiratory Medicine commentary, in an interview.
Still, she thought it was prudent for countries to begin considering face masks. ""Not enough evidence doesn’t mean the intervention itself is not effective,"" Feng said. ""And in this situation, I think the best way is to rely on all the available non-pharmaceutical interventions.""
Cloth and DIY Masks
Compared with surgical masks or respirators, very little research has been done on cloth masks.
In 2015, researchers published the first randomized controlled trial of cloth masks, and found that hospital workers in Vietnam were 13 times more likely to come down with an influenza-like illness when wearing a cloth mask rather than a disposable surgical one.
The cloth mask group also had higher rates of respiratory infection than the control group, which sometimes wore surgical masks per the hospitals’ standard practice. However, because there wasn’t a group that wore no masks at all, the researchers couldn’t tell whether cloth masks still might have provided some protection to wearers.
""[T]he finding of a much higher rate of infection in the cloth mask arm,"" the authors wrote, ""could be interpreted as harm caused by cloth masks, efficacy of medical masks, or most likely a combination of both.""
A few other studies have looked into how well certain fabrics or designs fare in the lab at blocking droplet and particle transmission. But as the authors of the trial in Vietnam noted in an article addressing their paper’s relevance to COVID-19, none of these masks have been tested in a clinical trial.
A 2013 study testing household materials for masks found that cotton T-shirts likely had some ability to filter out bacteria and viruses, but the masks were far less effective than surgical masks. The group concluded that a homemade mask would be better than no mask, but ""should only be considered as a last resort.""
In a more rigorous 2010 test, researchers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health bombarded T-shirts, towels, sweatshirts and scarves with nanoparticles to evaluate the filtration potential of DIY mask fabrics. While the materials’ performance paled in comparison to an N95 respirator and the authors noted that they provide ""only marginal respiratory protection,"" most fabrics caught at least some of the particles.
Linsey Marr, a Virginia Tech engineering professor who studies virus transmission, cautioned that people should not rely on homemade masks to prevent inhalation of viruses in the air, but she had some practical tips for those pursuing their own designs.
""The material should be thick and densely woven, like a kitchen towel or heavyweight t-shirt, and the mask should fit tightly around the nose and mouth with no gaps,"" she told us in an email.
As the National Academy of Sciences explains in a 2006 report on the possible use of improvised face masks during a pandemic, a tighter fabric structure may do a better job of filtration, but does have some trade-offs. ""[A]s the tightness of the structure increases, the breathing resistance increases, thereby affecting the user’s comfort while using the device,"" the report says, noting this ""may affect usage.""
If You Wear a Mask
For those who choose to wear a mask, Feng recommended learning the proper technique to reduce accidental infection from the mask itself. As demonstrated in a WHO video, the key is to not to touch the outside of the mask — and to wash your hands if you do.
The CDC also offers advice and a few patterns for those creating their own masks.
But most critically, don’t think a mask protects you or exempts you from social distancing or hand washing. As Feng told us, it’s ""better to stay home.""

      Democratic Ad Twists Trump’s ‘Hoax’ Comment

		The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action has been running an ad falsely suggesting President Donald Trump called the coronavirus outbreak a ""hoax.""
At the beginning, the ad splices together two quotes to have Trump saying, ""The coronavirus, this is their new hoax."" It is obvious in listening to the ad that he said, ""The coronavirus,"" and, ""this is their new hoax,"" at different times. His voice sounds quite different in the two segments.
But on the screen, ""The coronavirus, this is their new hoax"" appears as a single sentence.
Trump did use the word ""hoax"" but his full comments, and subsequent explanation, make clear he was talking about Democratic attacks on his administration’s handling of the outbreak, not the virus itself.

On April 13, the Trump campaign sued WJFW-NBC of Rhinelander, Wisconsin, for defamation for running the ad, which has been running in some version in swing states almost continually since March 24, according to Advertising Analytics, at a cost so far of about $2.5 million.
A 15-second version of the ad also appears online as part of a digital ad campaign.
After Priorities USA Action launched its $6 million ad campaign on television stations in the swing states of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in late March, the Trump campaign warned the stations not to run the ads to ""avoid costly and time consuming litigation.""
In addition to the misleading ""hoax"" segment, the ad features a series of statements in which Trump downplayed the risk of the coronavirus outbreak. These quotes are accurate.
As we have reported, the ""hoax"" kerfuffle began at a Trump rally in South Carolina on Feb. 28. At one point Trump said, ""And this is their new hoax."" But he did so in the context of assailing Democrats for trying to politicize what the Democrats saw as his administration’s shortcomings in combating the crisis.
Trump, Feb. 28: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ""How’s President Trump doing?"" They go, ""Oh, not good, not good."" They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia."" That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.
The president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and his impeachment as hoaxes, portrayed the Democrats’ criticism of his coronavirus policy as a continuation of a campaign to bring him down. Later in the rally, he referred to the coronavirus criticism as the Democrats’ ""single talking point.""
""A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right? It’s Donald Trump’s fault,"" he said. ""No, just things that happened.""
Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on Trump’s ""hoax"" remark. Former Vice President Joe Biden described the president’s comments as ""absolutely bizarre.""
The following day, at a press conference, Trump reiterated that he used the term ""hoax"" in connection to the Democrats’ attacks.
Reporter, Feb. 29: You were down in Charleston last night, using the word ""hoax"" when talking about Democrats. Somebody now is dead from this. Do you regret that kind of talk?
Trump: No, no, no. ""Hoax"" referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not — I’m not talking about what’s happening here; I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.
But the way they refer to it — because these people have done such an incredible job, and I don’t like it when they are criticizing these people. And that’s the hoax. That’s what I’m talking about.
The rest of the Priorities USA Action ad consists of statements by Trump dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus. As we have written, Trump made a series of such statements from Jan. 22 to March 10, and as recently as March 24 likened the disease’s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents.
The ad has Trump saying, ""We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China."" That’s what Trump told CNBC in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22.
The ad continues with Trump saying, ""One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear."" That’s what Trump told a gathering of African American leaders at a meeting on Feb. 27.
The next quote is, ""When you have 15 people and within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero."" Trump said this at a press conference on Feb. 26.
""We really think we’ve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum."" Trump said that at the same press conference.
The ad also quotes Trump: ""I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it."" Trump said this, referring to medical issues, during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 6.
And finally, the ad quotes Trump saying, ""No, I don’t take responsibility at all."" That’s what the president said at a press conference on March 13 when asked if he took responsibility for the federal government’s lag in testing for the coronavirus.
So the overwhelming bulk of the ad is on target. But the beginning is deceptive.

		President Donald Trump has twice now advanced the flawed theory that China nefariously continued to allow flights out of Wuhan, the city where the COVID-19 outbreak originated, to Western cities while blocking flights into other cities in China.
""You could fly out of Wuhan where the primary problem was … and you could go to different parts of the world, but you couldn’t go [from Wuhan] to Beijing and  you couldn’t go to any place in China. So what’s that all about?"" the president asked during a Fox News virtual town hall on May 3, implying that China may have sought to protect itself even as it was allowing infections to spread to other countries.
But that’s wrong. Flight records show China did block international commercial flights out of Wuhan after Jan. 23, according to Flightradar24, a global flight tracking service.
It appears the origin of Trump’s misguided speculation may be an op-ed by a Harvard professor who later ""updated"" his column to acknowledge that flight data does not confirm that China continued to allow commercial flights to various international destinations, including the U.S., after Jan. 23.
More than a week after the record had been set straight, though, Trump raised the bogus talking point during a press conference.
Trump, April 29: And then, why did China allow planes to fly out but not into China, but they allow planes to come out?  And planes are coming out of Wuhan, and they’re coming out; they’re going all over the world.  They’re going to Italy, very — very big time to Italy.  But they’re going all over the world.  But they’re not going into China.  What was that all about?
Trump repeated the talking point during the Fox News virtual town hall on May 3.
Trump, May 3: What they [Chinese leaders] really treated the world badly on: They stopped people going into China, but they didn’t stop people going into the USA and all over the world.  So you could fly out of Wuhan, where the primary problem was, all of the problems, essentially.  Also where the lab is.  But you could fly out of Wuhan and you could go to different parts of the world, but you couldn’t go to Beijing, and you couldn’t go to any place in China.  So what’s that all about?
We reached out to the White House to find out where the president was getting his information, but we did not get a response.
It appears the origin may be a column by historian and author Niall Ferguson in the (London) Sunday Times on April 5, in which he discussed questions that ought to be posed to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Among them: ""[A]fter it became clear that there was a full-blown epidemic spreading from Wuhan to the rest of Hubei province, why did you cut off travel from Hubei to the rest of China – on January 23 – but not from Hubei to the rest of the world?""
Hubei province is where the city of Wuhan is located.
Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a senior faculty fellow of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, continued: ""January is always a peak month for travel from China to Europe and America because of the lunar new year holiday. As far as I can tell from the available records, however, regular direct flights from Wuhan continued to run to London, Paris, Rome, New York and San Francisco throughout January and in some cases into February. You have lost no time in restricting international travel into China now that Covid-19 has gone global; your approach was conspicuously different when you were exporting it to us.""
The Jan. 23 date is significant because that is the day China implemented severe travel restrictions on Wuhan, halting train and air travel from the bustling city of 11 million people. That measure came two days after the country’s leading disease specialist, Zhong Nanshan, said in a press briefing that ""since it is known that the virus can be transmitted from people to people, one thing to do is to strictly quarantine patients and track close contacts, which is probably the most important thing,"" according to a timeline published by China. By that time, the virus was already known to have spread outside China, with the first recorded case in Thailand on Jan. 13.
However, the premise of Ferguson’s column — that China continued to allow flights from Wuhan to various international destinations including the U.S. after Jan. 23, even as China cut off travel between Wuhan and the rest of China — was later contested by Daniel Bell, dean of the School of Political Science and Public Administration at Shandong University in China.
In a post to his website dated April 21, Bell said he reached out to Ferguson via email, and that Ferguson provided his sourcing. But upon closer inspection, Bell wrote, ""the sources he sent did not support the allegation that there were regular commercial flights from Wuhan to the US and Europe after January 23rd and ‘in some cases into February.’""
While data Ferguson provided from global flight tracker FlightStats ""seem[ed] to show that thirty-one flights left from Wuhan to cities in the US and Europe on or after Jan 23,"" when Bell checked those against data from a website for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, he found that most of those flights were cancelled. And a handful of others originating in Guangzhou that ""in normal times would do a stopover in Wuhan on the way"" to San Francisco instead flew ""direct from Guangzhou, bypassing Wuhan.""
""The records show that flights out of Wuhan to the rest of the world stopped around mid-day on the 23rd,, the same day China stopped flights from Wuhan to the rest of China,"" Bell wrote.
""Why does it matter?"" Bell wrote. ""If the Chinese government did allow regular flights from Wuhan to Western countries after January 23rd, it suggests the Chinese government deliberately allowed, if not encouraged, the spread of the virus to five cities in Western countries after it tried to control it in China.""
We spoke to Ian Petchenik, the director of communications for Flightradar24, a global flight tracking service, and Petchenik confirmed that ""there were no more normal, commercial flights"" from Wuhan after Jan. 23. ""They did stop people from going to the U.S. and to the rest of the world,"" he said.
After Jan. 23, flight data shows there were a few flights from Wuhan to destinations in Asia outside of China, Petchenik told us, but those may have been mostly empty planes returning to their base country. There were also a handful of flights from Wuhan chartered by the U.S. State Department to evacuate American citizens, including diplomats and their families, beginning on Jan. 28. Passengers on those planes were flown to military bases in California and were mandated to complete a 14-day quarantine.
On April 21, Ferguson provided an ""update"" to his April 5 column in which he acknowledged, ""Data from sensors tracking actual flight paths would seem to indicate that no flights left from Wuhan itself to other countries in the world after January 23."" Ferguson wrote that he reached out to the U.S. company Flightspin, and that officials there ""concluded that it was very unlikely indeed that any flights had gone from Wuhan to Western cities after January 23.""
Ferguson added that ""we now know that by that time (Jan. 23) thousands of infected citizens had already left Wuhan for other parts of China, so a ban on all flights out of China would have been needed to prevent the epidemic becoming a global pandemic.""
""That is how COVID-19 spread so rapidly to the rest of the world,"" Ferguson said. ""And it was happening long before January 23, because the Chinese authorities, for whatever reason, waited until that late date to place their cordon sanitaire around Hubei.""
(The Trump administration announced travel restrictions to and from China on Jan. 31, effective Feb. 2. According to a New York Times report on April 4, nearly 40,000 people had arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China since Trump imposed those travel restrictions.)
Whether China should have halted air travel to and from Wuhan sooner than Jan. 23, or cut off international travel to and from all of China, rather than just Hubei, is a different issue, however, than the one raised by Trump.
An article in the Economic Times on April 30 noted that while China cut domestic travel from Wuhan to other Chinese cities in late January, it continued to encourage international travel from other cities in China. And it wasn’t until March 26 that China, fearing the outbreak of a second wave of coronavirus from overseas, banned all foreigners from traveling to China.
But that’s not what Trump said, either. Trump said China continued to allow flights from Wuhan to destinations around the world — including the U.S. — at the same time that it banned travel from Wuhan into other parts of China. That’s incorrect.

		Quick Take
A viral meme falsely suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci supports administering a COVID-19 vaccine before clinical trials are completed. Fauci supports the manufacture of vaccines while trials are underway — but only administering the vaccine once the trials are over and it is deemed effective and safe.

Full Story
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become a leading figure in addressing treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19 as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. 
But a meme circulating on Facebook, attributing two quotes to Fauci, falsely suggests an inconsistency in his views on the need for clinical trials before approving a COVID-19 treatment and the process needed to ensure the safety of an eventual vaccine.
The first quote in the meme reads, ""Just because hundreds of doctors are reporting hydroxychloroquine is curing some COVID-19 patients, it is not valid until we have a major study done."" Fauci has said that controlled clinical trials are required to make sure hydroxychloroquine is ""truly safe and truly effective"" against COVID-19, and the evidence so far does not show that it is. 
The second quote reads, ""As soon as a COVID-19 vaccine is manufactured, it must be delivered to healthcare professionals for immediate human injection. Proper studies can be done later."" That’s false. Fauci has said distribution and administration of a vaccine would only occur if the clinical trial shows that ""in fact it is effective"" and safe.
Hydroxychloroquine 
It is true that Fauci has cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine before its effectiveness is proven by a large clinical trial. In March, he explained that the evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 is largely ""anecdotal"" and that without first undergoing a controlled clinical trial — in which a treatment group is compared with a control group — the effectiveness of the drug cannot be known. 
Large trials are still pending, but the evidence so far does not suggest that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19.
One study, a randomized controlled trial of 150 patients hospitalized with mild to moderate disease in China, did not find the drug helped reduce the chance that patients would test positive for the virus within 28 days — and patients receiving hydroxychloroquine reported more side effects, although most were minor.
In a May 27 interview with CNN, Fauci said, ""The scientific data is really quite evident now about the lack of efficacy"" of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19, and he noted the likelihood of ""adverse events with regard to cardiovascular.""
COVID-19 Vaccine
Regarding a COVID-19 vaccine, Fauci did not say that the vaccine will be administered before ""proper studies"" are over, as the meme claims.
As we’ve written before, Fauci outlined the steps that the COVID-19 vaccine must go through at a February 25 press conference.
Fauci, Feb. 25: Now the thing we need to understand, because we want to make sure that people don’t get confused, that getting a vaccine into a Phase 1 trial within a three-month period, you need at least three to four months to determine if it’s safe and whether it induces the kind of response that you would predict will be protective. Once you do that you graduate to a much larger trial. … When you go to a Phase 2 trial, you’re talking about hundreds if not thousands of individuals to determine efficacy. That is a trial that we would have to conduct in those countries, in those areas, where there’s active transmission. That itself, even at rocket speed, would take at least an additional six to eight months. So when you are talking about the availability of a vaccine even to scale it up you’re talking about a year to a year-and-a-half. 
That timeline was revised on May 15, when the Trump administration announced ""Operation Warp Speed"" — a national program ""to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics."" The goal is ""to have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available for Americans by January 2021,"" the Department of Health and Human Services said.
In a June 1 interview with STAT News, Fauci explained how the administration would move more quickly to make a vaccine available to the public without compromising public health.
Fauci said manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine would begin ""even before you know it works,"" which may be the origin of the second quote in the meme. That would allow the vaccine to be widely distributed more quickly, but only ""if in fact it is effective,"" Fauci said.
""At the same time you’re finishing your Phase 1 trial, you’re preparing your Phase 3 trial sites, which is very expensive, and then you’re starting to manufacture the vaccine even before you know it works. All of that cuts months off,"" said Fauci. However, Fauci elaborated, ""We’ve designed the Phase 3 trial to very carefully look at safety, even more so than is done in a regular trial."" 
He described the accelerated timeline as ""aspirational,"" and cautioned that there is ""no guarantee"" that the vaccine will be proven effective.
Fauci, June 1: If … you’re already manufacturing doses, by December and January, if you’re lucky and if in fact it is effective, you can have a significant number of doses available by the end of the year, the beginning of 2021. So I think it’s aspirational, but it’s certainly doable.
The only thing that’s the big unknown to me is that, is it going to be effective? I think we could do it within the time frame that I’ve outlined. But there’s no guarantee that it’s going to be effective.
Many vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials. One vaccine that shows promise, developed by Moderna in partnership with NIAID, is scheduled in July to enter Phase 3 — the phase in which a vaccine is given to thousands of people to test for safety. Another vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, recently began recruiting participants for Phases 2 and 3 of the clinical trial. 
In a live Q&A with the Journal of the American Medical Association on June 3, Fauci said the plan to manufacture millions of doses of vaccine still undergoing clinical trial is ""very unique in vaccine development"" and is an investment risk for the companies and the federal government.
Fauci said the plan is to manufacture ""close to 100 million doses"" by the time clinical trials indicate whether the vaccine is effective, and that ""by the beginning of 2021, we hope to have a couple hundred million of doses.""

		1The United States has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 deaths per capita in the world. However, President Donald Trump made the false claim that ""Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people.""
As of May 11, the U.S. had 24.66 deaths per 100,000 people — more than two times higher than Germany (9.24 deaths per 100,000), and the 11th highest rate out of the more than 140 countries tracked by Johns Hopkins University.
Trump made his remarks about the per-capita death rates during a May 11 press briefing at the White House.
Trump, May 11: I think one of the things we’re most proud of is — this just came out — deaths per 100,000 people, death — so deaths per 100,000 people: Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder. Meaning, low is a positive, not a negative. Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that’s perhaps the most important number there is.
Of the more than 140 countries for which data is available, the U.S. figure for deaths per 100,000 people as of May 11 was the 11th highest and Germany’s was the 18th highest. Neither is anywhere near the ""lowest rung of that ladder.""






Countries near the top diagonal line have the highest mortality per 100,000 people in the general population. Points with a black border represent the 10 most affected countries by COVID-19 worldwide, based on the number of deaths. (Data is as of May 11 at 11:46 p.m. EST.)


Source of chart: Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.



We asked the White House if the president’s claim was based on other data, but we have not received a response.
It’s possible Trump meant to refer to a different statistic on the Johns Hopkins University website: the observed case-fatality ratio (COVID-19 deaths divided by confirmed cases) among the 10 countries the university said have been ""most affected"" by the global coronavirus outbreak. By that limited measure, Germany (4.4%) had the lowest case-fatality ratio and the U.S. (6.0%) had the second lowest among the 10 countries.  
But that’s not what Trump said. 
Instead, the president gave the false impression that the U.S. — which has had more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and about 80,000 deaths — has one of the lowest per-capita death rates of any nation.

      What Science Says About Children, COVID-19 and School Reopenings

		In promoting the reopening of schools this fall, Trump administration officials have, at times, inaccurately described the evidence on how COVID-19 affects children:

Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus task force lead on testing, said on July 12 that studies in other countries show ""young children do not seem to spread the virus"" and ""don’t get sick."" Children are very rarely seriously ill, but they do get sick. And while some studies indicate young children may not transmit the virus as readily as adults, it remains an unsettled issue.
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos the same day said ""there’s nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous."" That’s an exaggeration. Much of the evidence suggests schools can be reopened relatively safely, but there have been outbreaks linked to schools.

For weeks, President Donald Trump has pushed for schools to return to in-person instruction, even threatening to withhold funding if schools choose to stay closed.
""In Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and many other countries, SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WITH NO PROBLEMS,"" Trump wrote in a July 8 tweet. ""The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!""
But experts say questions remain about how frequently kids transmit the coronavirus to others. And the countries where children have returned to classrooms did so with much less ongoing community transmission than many places in the U.S. now have.
""We have some evidence that children, especially younger children, may spread the virus less than adults,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us, noting that this makes COVID-19 quite different from influenza, which kids are notorious for spreading.
But, she added, many of the transmission studies include children who were more sheltered than usual. ""So there are lingering questions about how much reconvening schools would increase transmission within the community and, perhaps more worryingly, to school teachers and staff who may be more inclined to develop severe disease,"" she said.
We’ll review the existing evidence on how often children pick up the infection, get seriously ill and spread the virus, and share examples from other countries that may or may not be a preview of what’s to come.
Children at Low Risk for Severe COVID-19
While less is known about infection and transmission, the evidence is very consistent that children are at extremely low risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19.
Between Jan. 22 and May 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded only 13 deaths in children ages 0 to 9, out of more than 20,000 confirmed cases, and 33 deaths among those ages 10 to 19, out of more than 49,000 cases (see Table 3). That works out to a case fatality rate of around 0.06% to 0.07%, much lower than the case fatality rate for all ages of 5.4%.
According to the same data, kids were also significantly less likely to be hospitalized or admitted to intensive care units compared with adults. Only 848, or 4.1%, of children age 9 or younger were hospitalized, and 141, or 0.7%, were admitted to the ICU, with even lower figures for older kids between the ages of 10 and 19. In comparison, more than a fifth of patients between the ages of 60 and 69 were hospitalized, and 4.1% were admitted to the ICU.
These figures likely overstate the true percentage of children who are infected who go on to become hospitalized or die, since many mild or asymptomatic infections in children may have been missed.
As of July 22, provisional CDC data list 11 deaths for babies below the age of 1 involving COVID-19, nine deaths between the ages of 1 and 4, and 16 between the ages of 5 and 14.
State data available from the American Academy of Pediatrics also shows that for New York City and the 20 states with hospitalization data, between 0.6% and 9.1% of all pediatric cases resulted in hospitalization, as of July 9. And for New York City and the 43 states with mortality data, between 0% and 0.2% of kids with COVID-19 died, with 24 states reporting no deaths in children.
It’s nevertheless important to acknowledge that the risk of COVID-19 to children is not zero.
""It is not nil, but it is low,"" said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, of the risk of death to kids and teens in a press call. ""No age group gets out of this without risk.""
Hanage added that as with adults, some children might experience long-term or chronic effects of COVID-19 infection. ""We can expect to see some of those consequences in the health of children going forward,"" he said, even if the overall risk of death to children is ""extremely low.""
One worrisome but rare manifestation linked to COVID-19 is a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, which involves dangerous inflammation of various organs and typically develops two to four weeks after a child is infected with the coronavirus.
MIS-C patients frequently have a fever and other symptoms, such as gut pain, vomiting, diarrhea, a skin rash and fatigue. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, of 186 children with MIS-C, 80% were admitted to the ICU and 2% died.
As of July 15, the CDC is aware of 342 MIS-C cases and six deaths in the U.S., with most cases occurring in kids between the ages of 1 and 14 and in Black or Latino children.
COVID-19 Infection and Transmission in Kids
It’s good that the risk of COVID-19 to children themselves is low, but schools employ adult staff and teachers, around a quarter of whom are older or have health conditions that put them at greater risk of COVID-19, according to an estimate by the Kaiser Family Foundation. And some children live in households with grandparents or other higher-risk relatives as well.
Thus, two key questions are: How susceptible are children to becoming infected with the coronavirus? And how likely are they to transmit the virus on to others? The answers are still uncertain.
According to a July report by the National Academies of the Sciences, there is ""insufficient evidence with which to determine how easily children and youth contract the virus and how contagious they are once they do.""
Still, there are hints that children may do better than adults on both fronts. 
""Almost all the studies that we have about the role of children in transmission suffer from biases of one kind or another,"" said Hanage. ""However, it is plausible to think, taking a read of all of them together, that younger children are somewhat less likely to become infected. And maybe a little less likely to transmit. Older children behave much more like adults.""
As noted in a May report from Johns Hopkins University, several studies have found that children, particularly younger kids, were less likely to test positive for COVID-19. A survey in Iceland, for example, found that 6.7% of kids ages 0 to 9 who were at higher risk of infection tested positive, compared with 13.7% of people 10 years of age and older. And in a population-wide sampling, zero of 848 children ages 0 to 9 turned up positive, versus 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older.
Other studies looking at what happens within households have largely found kids are less likely to catch the coronavirus, but they have not always been consistent. In one analysis of household contacts of COVID-19 patients near Wuhan, China, only 4% of pediatric contacts tested positive for COVID-19, while 17.1% of adult contacts did. In another study of nearly 1,300 contacts in Shenzhen, China, children were equally likely as adults to become infected.
On transmission, there are signs that kids might be less efficient spreaders of SARS-CoV-2, although that conclusion is still tentative. 
A study in the Netherlands found no instances of a child under the age of 12 serving as the source of infection among 54 households, and a survey of familial clusters in Switzerland identified only three cases, out of 39, in which the child developed symptoms first and may have been the source of the virus.
Schoolchildren infected with COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic also appear to have only rarely spread the virus to others. In France, scientists identified no secondary cases as a result of three probable infections in students before schools closed, and a nine-year-old boy in the French Alps who went skiing and visited three schools while infected also failed to pass the virus on. In Australia, officials found only two possible secondary infections after tracing nearly 900 contacts of 18 infected students and staff members.
""Household studies have typically found that children are rarely infected and rarely transmit,"" said Hanage. But, he cautioned, ""those household studies all suffer from bias, which is that they start by identifying a person who was infected. And then, testing the people around them.""
Because kids are much less likely to have severe disease, or even noticeable symptoms at all, he said, that means adults are more likely to be identified as the first, or index, case.
On top of that, Hanage said, in many cases schools are closed and parents have been sequestering children, ""so we’re not seeing the types of interactions that we might expect if schools are opened.""
One large contact tracing study out of South Korea, published on July 16, found that kids 9 years old and younger were less likely to transmit the virus within households than older children, but were similar to adults ages 20-39. Older children, surprisingly, had the highest percentage of household contacts test positive for COVID-19 out of all the age groups.
For contacts outside the home, younger and older children appeared to transmit the disease about as frequently as adults ages 20-39, but less frequently than adults above 40. 
But as with other studies, the scientists could not say for certain whom the index patients were, and the study took place when schools were largely shuttered. The researchers also only traced contacts of children who fell ill, leaving open the question of how frequently asymptomatic children transmit the virus. 
A. Marm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies infectious disease dynamics, said in a Twitter thread that he didn’t think it was ""safe"" to conclude that children don’t transmit the same as adults, given the low number of cases and the wide confidence intervals in the study.
Interestingly, when the amount of virus is measured in infected children, it comes back just as high in kids as in adults, suggesting that children could in theory be equally contagious. A person’s viral load, however, may not necessarily track with how well they transmit the virus.
If it is the case that kids do transmit the virus less than adults, there are several theories for why that might be. One hypothesis is that children, by virtue of being less symptomatic or by being smaller, might spew fewer infectious particles into the air.
Scientists have also suggested that children may not contract the virus as easily because they don’t make as much ACE2, the protein receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells. One investigation of nasal tissue found that young children have less of the receptor than older children, who in turn have less than adults.
School Reopenings in Other Countries
Encouragingly, numerous other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Germany, Finland, France, Denmark, Austria and Norway, have successfully reopened their schools using a variety of mitigation tactics, and have not observed subsequent outbreaks.
Experts, however, caution that those results may not apply to the U.S.
""Those are also regions that had much lower community transmission on the date that they reopened,"" said Anita Cicero, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in a July 16 press call dedicated to the subject of school reopenings.
""So for instance, in Japan, South Korea and Finland and France, each of those countries had about 1 or fewer cases per 100,000 people when they reopened,"" she said. ""In contrast, there are U.S. counties now reporting 60 cases per 100,000; others have 80 cases or more.""
""In communities where the case numbers are rapidly increasing, it may not be possible to safely reopen schools until disease transmission has lowered,"" said Johns Hopkins’ Nuzzo in the same briefing. ""But in communities where disease rates are declining or stable, it may be possible to think about reopening schools, provided schools are able to put in place measures to reduce the likelihood of transmission.""
While there is little data on the most effective strategies, experts recommend physical distancing, mask wearing, hand hygiene and keeping kids in smaller group ""bubbles"" to reduce the number of contacts children and teachers have.
A counter example comes from a high school in Israel, which experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 after reopening. While it is impossible to know for sure that the outbreak was due to the school — as Nuzzo noted, restrictions were also lifted on the broader community — the timing is suspicious. Researchers also suspect a heat wave may have played a role, triggering the school to use continuous air conditioning and exempt students from wearing face masks.
""Increasing transmission in the surrounding community because of large public gatherings and then lifting precautions in the schools have ultimately contributed to numbers of infections within schools and led Israel to close schools again,"" said Nuzzo.
The issue of community transmission is one that other groups and experts have highlighted.
""The fact remains that when community transmission exists and when community transmission is intense, children will be exposed to that virus and children will be part of the transmission cycle,"" said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies programme, in a July 13 press briefing. ""They will be exposed; some will be infected and they may infect others. What we don’t fully understand is the impact on those children in the long term. We know in the short term they tend to have milder infections. We don’t know the impact in the long term and we don’t know to what extent they pass that infection on and infect others, but we do know that that can happen.""
The American Academy of Pediatrics has emphasized the need for children to return to school, arguing that the benefits outweigh the risks, while also acknowledging that local transmission should be considered when making decisions on reopening schools.
According to Nuzzo, there isn’t necessarily a specific cutoff number school administrators should use to know whether they should reopen, but a stable or downward trend in cases is a good place to start, as well as consideration of a community’s ability to respond to an outbreak.
""If there’s sufficient capacity to test and to isolate anybody who’s sick and to conduct contact tracing,"" she said in the school press briefing, ""that’s obviously a much more reassuring situation than in communities where those resources are constrained.""
The University of Minnesota’s Michael Osterholm, who directs the school’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, suggested in a July 23 podcast that schools aim for 5 cases or fewer per 100,000 people, along with decreasing numbers of new cases for the past 14 days and area hospitals maintaining at least a quarter of their capacity to handle COVID-19 patients.
More research, experts say, is urgently needed to better understand the risks so those can be balanced against the benefits to children and parents.
As Cicero noted, if it becomes more clear that children very rarely transmit COVID-19 to adult school staff and family members, ""then schools would have a very different set of policies and less extensive mitigation measures that they would need to put in place.""
For now, however, she said schools need additional funding to follow CDC guidance and should consider postponing reopening in areas with high community transmission. Schools, too, may find that hybrid in-person and online programs work best to keep class sizes low and higher-risk individuals at home.
""We really need to be doing all we can to drive those numbers down so that we can return children to school buildings,"" she said. ""This should be a national priority, and it’s measurably more important than reopening bars and restaurants.""

		The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted on April 23 to resume the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine with a warning that it may cause a very rare, but dangerous blood clotting condition.
The 10 to 4 vote came 10 days after the CDC and Food and Drug Administration on April 13 recommended ""a pause in the use"" of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine ""out of an abundance of caution,"" due to six reports of a rare blood clot combined with low levels of blood platelets among more than 7 million J&J vaccines administered.
At the April 23 meeting, a CDC scientist presented nine additional reported cases, bringing the total confirmed cases to 15 out of nearly 8 million vaccine doses, as of April 21. Three of the 15 have died and four remain in intensive care.
We’ll take a look at these rare conditions, their frequency and the risks of COVID-19.
What do we know about the six cases, and have there been more since the pause was recommended on April 13?
The initial six cases were among 7.2 million J&J vaccines administered. They involved women, age 18 to 48, who suffered from a combination of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, and low levels of blood platelets, a condition known as thrombocytopenia. 
The combination of blood clotting and a drop in platelets, which help form clots to stop bleeding, ""makes a pattern,"" Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an April 13 press conference. And that pattern has similarly been reported in Europe in relatively few cases among the millions who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The FDA’s revised fact sheet for health care providers administering the J&J vaccine now says the reports of adverse events in the U.S. ""suggest an increased risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses and other sites … combined with thrombocytopenia and with onset of symptoms approximately one to two weeks after vaccination,"" noting that most cases have involved women ages 18 to 49. The warning says: ""Based on currently available evidence, a causal relationship between thrombosis with thrombocytopenia and the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is plausible.""
Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines use the same type of technology — a modified, harmless adenovirus to prompt the body to produce an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, J&J scientists have pointed out that there are differences in the makeup of the vaccines. 
The U.S. agencies cautioned health care providers that the anticoagulant drug normally used to treat blood clots — heparin — ""may be dangerous"" in these cases and ""alternative treatments need to be given.""
At the April 23 ACIP meeting, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, head of the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Team, said in his presentation that there have been, as of April 21, a total of 15 confirmed cases, including three deaths. Seven of the 15 remain hospitalized, including four in intensive care, he said.
Of the 15 total cases, 13 occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 49 and two — both disclosed on April 23 —  involved women between the ages of 50 and 64.
Shimabukuro called this rare clotting condition thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS.
How rare or common are these two conditions normally — the blood clots and low levels of platelets? 
This type of blood clot — cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST — is rare. It occurs in the veins in the sinuses that drain blood away from the brain.
It occurs in 2 to 14 people out of 1 million each year in the general population, according to Marks.
An April 15 CDC presentation for clinicians included similar estimates of the expected risk (0.5 to 2 per 100,000 people) and said CVST occurred in about 0.5% to 1% of all strokes. The median age for patients was 37 years. The condition was three times more common in women.
The risk factors included prothrombotic conditions, meaning a tendency to develop blood clots; birth control pills; pregnancy and post-partum; cancer; infection and lumbar puncture.

The CDC said the cases following J&J vaccination were at least three times greater than the expected rate of CVST for women in the 20-50 age group. ""Observed cases following Janssen COVID-19 vaccines appear to exceed expected based on background rates of CVST among women aged 20–50 years (3-fold or greater),"" the presentation said, referring to Janssen Biotech Inc., a Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company. 
But in all cases, the patients also had low levels of blood platelets.
A low level of platelets, without accompanying CVST, is more common. Dr. Robert Brodsky, director of the division of hematology and professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told us, ""We have people in all the time with low platelets.""
But the expected rate in the general population of the combination of CVST and low levels of blood platelets is unknown, the CDC said at its April 15 presentation.
What similarities are there between these cases and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia?
These reported cases after vaccination with the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines appear to be similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or HIT, a condition in which the body has an immune response after a patient receives the anticoagulant heparin, causing both low levels of blood platelets and blood clots. ""It appears that there is overlap between the two disorders,"" Dr. Mortimer Poncz, division chief of pediatric hematology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us.
With HIT, antibodies attach to platelet factor 4, a protein in blood platelets. Patients can be tested for those antibodies. Eleven of the 15 U.S. cases that occurred after the J&J vaccination tested positive for the HIT antibody, and antibody results weren’t available for the other cases, according to Shimabukuro’s April 23 presentation.
Studies in Europe similarly found positive HIT antibody tests for cases involving blood clots and low platelet counts some time after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Brodsky said that with the reports after the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines, the ""clinical manifestations resemble"" HIT. And Poncz said there are ""subtle differences"" that, for instance, suggest antibodies in HIT and the vaccine cases ""may or may not be recognizing distinct targets on the PF4.""
In terms of how common HIT normally is, Poncz provided statistics that would only apply for hospitalized people who receive forms of the drug heparin. In that population, HIT occurs in about 1 case in every 100 for unfractionated heparin and 1 in 1,000 for low molecular weight heparin, he said. It’s more common in the elderly.
""The thrombocytopenia often is mild,"" Poncz said of HIT cases, ""but the thrombosis in veins more than arteries can be striking leading to limb or life lost.""
However, CVST, the type of blood clot in the six initial U.S. cases, is ""rare in HIT,"" he said, as well as abdomen clots. The CVST occurrence stands out in these cases after vaccination, Poncz said in an interview a week after the CDC and FDA recommended a pause.
""There are other causes of a combination of the paradox of low platelet counts (which causes bleeding) and thrombosis,"" Poncz said in an email, citing an autoimmune disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome, sepsis and severe COVID-19. With severe COVID-19, ""it’s more of a diffuse all over the body process going on.""
Now that health care providers know not to use heparin, how treatable is the combination of conditions?
Poncz told us that early recognition and the use of other anticoagulants is important, and there are new, effective therapeutics for some cases. But treatment is ""still a significant challenge. It doesn’t eliminate the risk of limb or life loss.""
How common have these cases been among those who have received the J&J vaccine and those who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe?
In the U.S., the 15 cases of TTS represent nearly 2 in 1 million of the nearly 8 million J&J vaccines administered as of April 21. Since 13 of those cases were among women under 50, the incidence would be 7 in 1 million for women ages 18 to 49. (The CDC said nearly 1.9 million J&J vaccine doses had been administered to women in that age group as of April 21.)
Update, July 8: As of July 6, the CDC and FDA had identified 38 total cases among more than 12.6 million J&J vaccines administered. There have been three deaths linked to the blood clotting condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
Brodsky said there has been a wide range among the countries reviewing cases of blood clots with low platelets, with the high end being 1 in 250,000 in Norway.
Most of the worldwide cases have been in women, he said, and many of them under age 50. These are ""rare, very severe life-threatening complications … that tend to occur in younger women"" but not exclusively, he said.
Brodsky said there was ""clearly an association with the vaccine that appears to be higher than what you would expect in the general population. To put it in perspective, Germany estimates 9-fold higher than what you’d expect in the general population."" As we said above, the CDC estimated a 3-fold higher incidence than what one would expect. But it’s ""still very rare,"" Brodsky said. 
An April 11 news report in Science said there had been at least 222 suspected cases reported in Europe after 34 million individuals had received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. That would be a rate of 6.5 per 1 million. 
The European Medicines Agency’s safety committee said on April 7 that ""unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects"" of the AstraZeneca vaccine, also known as Vaxzevria vaccine. On April 20, it said ""a warning about unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be added to the product information"" for the J&J vaccine, saying that the conditions were ""very rare"" and that the benefits of the vaccine ""outweigh the risks of side effects.""
How do these rare clotting incidents compare with the risk of dying from COVID-19?
Even among the group believed to be most affected — women between the ages of 18 and 49 — there’s a greater chance of dying of COVID-19 than suffering from this very rare clotting syndrome.
Here’s what we know:
Shimabukuro, head of the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Team, said in his April 23 presentation that there were 15 reported cases of TTS in 7.98 million people who had received the J&J vaccine, as of April 21. That’s a reported rate of 1.88 cases per million doses administered.
As we said, the reported case rate is even higher for women ages of 18 and 49. According to Shimabukuro’s presentation, there were 1,866,294 doses of the J&J vaccine administered to women 18 to 49 years old and a reported case rate of 7 per million.
As for COVID-19 deaths, the CDC reports death totals by age groups and percentage of deaths by gender.
As of April 20, the CDC website had data for 437,186 deaths by age group, including 19,727 deaths for those 18 to 49. Women ages 18 to 49 represented 34.7% of the 19,727 deaths, meaning they accounted for 6,841 deaths. Using Census Bureau population estimates for 2019, we determined there were 100 COVID deaths per 1 million women ages 18 to 49.
Below is a chart of COVID-19 deaths per 1 million population by age group for both sexes.

Clearly, older people are at the highest risk of dying of COVID-19 and even among younger women the risk is higher than the rare clotting issue identified in people who have received the J&J vaccine. Still, Brodsky said the potential risk isn’t something that should be ignored. ""Your benefit of a vaccine and risk of dying from COVID really change with age.""
For a 75-year-old woman who is overweight and has conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, ""absolutely that vaccine is going to be more helpful than harmful."" For a healthy 28-year-old woman, who has a ""negligible if not zero chance of dying from COVID. … I don’t know,"" he said. ""Especially if other vaccines are available.""
Have vaccines been linked to other bleeding disorders? 
As for the other COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S., there have been reports of thrombocytopenia, the low blood platelets, but not in combination with blood clots among a few recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Whether that’s ""causal or coincidental"" isn’t known yet, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, told us. 
One study that examined 20 reports of thrombocytopenia following vaccination with those shots said the ""incidence … appears either less than or roughly comparable to what would be seen if the cases were coincidental following vaccination."" The study, published Feb. 19 in the American Journal of Hematology, concluded that it was ""impossible at this time"" to distinguish between a vaccine-induced condition and a coincidental one.
The CDC says that ""women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination"" with the J&J vaccine, ""and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.""
Offit said thrombocytopenia occurred in 1 in 25,000 to 30,000 recipients of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. But natural measles infection can lead to the condition, so it’s ""not surprising"" that a weakened, live virus vaccine would do so but more rarely, he said.
But those occurrences, Offit said, are ""completely different"" from the reported cases of thrombocytopenia and blood clots after the J&J vaccination.

		Quick Take
A paper that has not been peer-reviewed reaches faulty conclusions to advance the unsubstantiated claim that the novel coronavirus was bioengineered in a Chinese lab, according to immunology and microbiology experts. The paper’s claims were amplified by Fox News, anyway.

Full Story 
A long-circulating, unsubstantiated claim about the origins of the novel coronavirus resurfaced in recent days after a paper published online purported that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab.
The baseless claim — which we first addressed in the early days of the pandemic — was further amplified when Fox News host Tucker Carlson featured an interview with one of the authors of the paper on his show on Sept. 15.
That segment was viewed on YouTube nearly 2 million times and that link alone was shared by more nearly 50,000 users on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data, where other popular posts also repeated the allegations.
But experts say the new paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, does not prove that the virus was created in a lab.
The paper was uploaded to an open-access website Sept. 14 and was published by the ""Rule of Law Society & Rule of Law Foundation"" — two related entities in New York tied to Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald Trump. Bannon is listed as the chair of the Rule of Law Society in a registration document filed last year with the state.
The organizations are connected to a partnership forged by Bannon and Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman, that has been described as being based on their shared disdain for the Chinese government. Guo is wanted in China on charges of bribery and fraud — allegations he has denied — according to the New York Times. Bannon announced in November 2018 that Guo would be setting up a $100 million ""Rule of Law fund"" in part to aid Chinese dissidents and their families.
Guo’s work in the U.S., including consulting services from Bannon, has drawn the interest of federal investigators, the Wall Street Journal has reported.
The new paper attempts to make the case that the novel coronavirus couldn’t have come from nature and instead may have been created by altering a previously discovered bat coronavirus. But several of its main points rest on faulty conclusions.
One of the study’s main claims is that the ""genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is suspiciously similar to that of a bat coronavirus discovered by military laboratories"" in China and therefore indicates that another coronavirus was used to create the novel coronavirus.


Kristian G. Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research who has studied the origins of the virus, said of the claim on Twitter: ""This simply can’t be true – there are more than 3,500 nucleotide differences between SARS-CoV-2 and these viruses.""
And Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa who studies coronaviruses, told us in an email that the coronavirus referenced — ZC45 — is ""only 89% related to SARS-CoV-2. In virology terms, that is very distant.""
Perlman said it would be nearly impossible to make the reverse genetics system needed to manipulate the virus and ""changing its sequence to arrive at SARS-CoV-2 would be virtually impossible since it would not be known how to manipulate the virus.""
Nevertheless, Dr. Li-Meng Yan — one of the authors of the new paper and a virologist who has claimed she fled China to reveal the truth about COVID-19 — doubled down on Carlson’s show. She alleged a cover-up by the Chinese government and the scientific community.
Yan, Sept. 15: This virus, COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 virus, actually is not from nature. It is a man-made virus created in the lab based on the China military discovered and owned the very unique bat coronavirus, which cannot affect people, but after the modification become a very harmful virus at now. So, I have evidence to show why they can do it, what they have done, how did they do it.
The paper goes on to suggest that ""SARS-CoV-2 contains a unique furin-cleavage site in its Spike protein"" — which is ""completely absent in this particular class of coronaviruses found in nature"" — and that, therefore, the virus was engineered.
Susan R. Weiss, a University of Pennsylvania professor of microbiology who researches coronaviruses, told us in an email that that ""makes no sense in terms of what we know about"" coronaviruses.
""Among murine coronavirus strains there are viruses with the furin site and strains without — closely related strains closer than SARS-1 and SARS-2 yet they are all virulent,"" Weiss said. ""So this observation says nothing to me about the virus being engineered.""
A furin site is a short protein sequence that can be recognized and cut by other proteins.
Perlman also said ""furin sites are found in many coronaviruses and finding it does not surprise us in the field.""
The paper also argues a conspiracy is afoot by claiming that scientific journals won’t publish the ""alternative theory that the virus may have come from a research laboratory.""
""I don’t believe that,"" Weiss said. ""It is just that the data is not compelling. I don’t know any CoV researchers that believe this at all. There is no way anyone could figure out how to make a virus behave like SARS-2 – asymptomatic spread for [one] thing.""
In March, Andersen and other scientists concluded in an article in Nature Medicine that the novel coronavirus ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" The authors said that the virus likely originated in one of two ways: ""natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,"" meaning before the spread of disease from animals to humans, or ""natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.""
The Nature Medicine article did say it couldn’t rule out an accidental laboratory release of the naturally occurring virus, but its authors said they ""do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.""
The new, dubious paper attempts to discredit those findings by saying the Nature Medicine study’s authors ""show signs of conflict of interests, raising further concerns on the credibility of this publication.""
The supposed support for that allegation: that one of the authors, Columbia University’s Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, received an award from China for his work on public health there following the 2003 outbreak of the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
The new paper also references the curriculum vitae of another author — Edward C. Holmes, a researcher at the University of Sydney in Australia — which shows that he has collaborated with scientists and organizations in China.
""[D]espite the online lies and malicious editing of my Wikipedia page, I have never received any funds from China, personal or research, and have no grants with Chinese scientists. I do have some honorary appointments there and a nice certificate though,"" Holmes wrote on Twitter. ""I do work closely with some Chinese scientists and as that directly led to the first release of the genome sequence that might just perhaps possibly be argued to be a good thing.""
Andersen also said that the allegation about the authors being ""conflicted"" was wrong. ""[M]y lab has never received funding from China and we have no collaborations with Chinese investigators. I have no financial interests in China,"" he said in a tweet. ""All our analyses are scientific and unbiased.""
It’s worth noting that collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and China aren’t uncommon. A recent study published in Higher Education found that U.S. research output between 2014 and 2018 would have dropped without Chinese partnerships — while China’s output would have grown regardless of work with the U.S. ""[T]he findings demonstrate that the USA has more to lose than gain in cutting ties with China,"" its authors wrote.
Public health officials have also suggested the virus originated in bats.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said: ""The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.""
And in April, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement that the ""Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified."" The intelligence community, it said, ""will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.""
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told National Geographic in a May interview, ""If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what’s out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated.""
""Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,"" Fauci said.
Jessica McDonald contributed to this article.

Update, Sept. 28: Experts have since published more thorough reviews of Yan’s paper. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security concluded that the paper ""presents a theory about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 but offers contradictory and inaccurate information that does not support their argument."" 


And in a review published by the MIT Press’ ""Rapid Reviews COVID-19,"" researchers from IBM and the University of Michigan found that the paper ""does not demonstrate sufficient scientific evidence to support its claims"" and that its ""[c]laims are at times baseless and are not supported by the data and methods used."" 
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for ""more investigation"" to determine how the pandemic began. ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,"" they wrote. ""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""

		Q: Do the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility?
A: There’s no evidence that approved vaccines cause fertility loss. Although clinical trials did not study the issue, loss of fertility has not been reported among thousands of trial participants nor confirmed as an adverse event among millions who have been vaccinated.  

FULL QUESTION
A group of woman in their 20’s I know are not getting the vaccine. They are nurses and teachers. They say that the vaccine can cause infertility. Is this true?
FULL ANSWER
On Feb. 5, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine released a statement assuring patients that there’s no evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines can impact the capacity to conceive children. 
Although there’s limited research on the matter since clinical trials did not specifically study fertility, no related issues have been reported among thousands of trial participants. In fact, some of them got pregnant. Initial studies on animals for the Moderna vaccine showed no impact on female reproduction or fetal development either. And although detecting fertility issues can take time, as of Jan. 20, fertility loss has not been found to be a side effect among millions who have already received the vaccines after authorization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
""Loss of fertility is scientifically unlikely,"" health reproductive experts concluded in their statement.  
The statement was issued to address public anxiety caused by baseless viral claims stating that vaccines can lead to infertility, and even female sterilization. And it reiterates previous recommendations for pregnant patients, as well as those undergoing fertility treatment or planning to conceive. 
""Since the vaccine is not a live virus, there is no reason to delay pregnancy attempts because of vaccination administration or to defer treatment until the second dose has been administered,"" according to a document prepared by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in December.
As we have explained, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA vaccines, or mRNA, which do not contain a weaker or inactivated version of the virus. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make their own spike proteins (found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2), prompting the body to generate protective antibodies and activate T cells.
According to the CDC, there is ""no risk"" of getting COVID-19 from this type of vaccine, and because the mRNA doesn’t enter the nucleus of the cell, it does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA. After making the spike protein, the cells break down the mRNA fairly quickly.
""Given the mechanism of action and the safety profile of the vaccine in non-pregnant individuals, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are not thought to cause an increased risk of infertility,"" recommendations posted on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists website say. 
Dr. Eve C. Feinberg, medical director of Northwestern Fertility & Reproductive Medicine and former president of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility, says there are really two questions when trying to find out the impact of vaccines in fertility: What do we know about the vaccine and fertility, and what do we know about COVID-19 and pregnancy?  
""And I think that we know a lot more about the negative impact of COVID in pregnancy, on both the mother and potentially the fetus, than about the vaccine on fertility. The mechanism of action of the vaccine is such that there really is no biological possibility as to how the vaccine may negatively impact fertility,"" Feinberg, who is also a member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s Coronavirus/COVID-19 Task Force, told us. 
Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said people shouldn’t be worried about COVID-19 vaccines causing infertility. He said it is very hard for a vaccine to do something that natural infection doesn’t do, and fertility loss has not been reported even after roughly 67 million people in the U.S. have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, according to antibody surveillance studies. 
""If you know that 20% of the population has been infected with this virus, is there any evidence that we’ve had a decrease in fertility associated with this massive worldwide pandemic? And the answer is, no,"" he said in a video. 
Vaccines Do Not Cause Female Sterilization 


Multiple false claims tying mRNA vaccines with infertility have been circulating, in both English and Spanish, for months. But among them, a false rumor saying they could cause ""female sterilization"" by training the body to attack a protein vital for the formation of the placenta has been particularly pervasive. 
The false rumor started with an article titled ""Head of Pfizer Research: Covid Vaccine is Female Sterilization"" that baselessly stated the ""vaccine contains a spike protein… called syncytin-1, vital for the formation of the human placenta"" and therefore, the vaccine could form an immune response against that protein, causing infertility. 
Syncytin-1 is an envelope protein, derived from a human endogenous retrovirus, critical in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast, the outermost layer of the human placenta, responsible for nutrient exchange from mother to embryo. 
But according to researchers, neither the Pfizer/BioNTech nor the Moderna vaccines contain syncytin-1.
The story, published on Dec. 2, on a blog called Health and Money News, linked to a petition demanding the European Medicines Agency stop clinical trials on the vaccines for safety concerns. The petition was co-filed by Wolfgang Wodarg, a German physician, and Michael Yeadon, a retired British doctor who worked as a respiratory research employee for Pfizer until 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile. Yeadon had previously claimed the pandemic was ""effectively over"" in the U.K. and no vaccines were needed. 
According to Wodarg and Yeadon’s petition, syncytin-1 is ""also found in homologous form in the spike proteins of SARS viruses,"" including SARS-CoV-2. They acknowledge that ""[t]here is no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS viruses would also act like anti-Syncytin-1 antibodies."" But they maintain if it happens, it would cause women to ""essentially becoming infertile"" by preventing the formation of placenta. 
The false claims were debunked by multiple fact-checkers in December.
In January, a group of independent reproductive health experts published an article in ASRM’s Fertility and Sterility, stating that the vaccine ""contains neither syncytin-1 nor the mRNA sequence for syncytin-1."" 
To prove that the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein, or spike protein, is not ""homologous,"" or similar in structure, to syncytin-1 protein, as Wodarg and Yeadon claimed, the scientists aligned the amino acid sequences of both proteins using a program that compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases. Little similarities were found – a finding confirmed by Pfizer.
Eduardo Hariton, a clinical fellow in reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the co-authors of the article, told FactCheck.org the researchers published their results after having to constantly reassure worried colleagues, friends and family members that there was no basis to these claims. 
""What they were claiming is that because the COVID spike protein looks like syncytin-1, by training your immune system against the COVID protein, your body would attack syncytin-1. And that is not correct because when you look at the genetic sequences of the spike protein and syncytin-1 there is not that much overlap. So even if that was the case, you would not expect the COVID vaccine to train your body to attack syncytin-1, because they’re just so different,"" he said. 
Several scientists have proved the same: The similarities of both proteins are too small for the immune system to be confused by the two. In fact, they are as similar as the spike protein could be to other proteins abundant in the body. Therefore, even if the immune system could be confused, scientists would have already seen related issues in patients who have had COVID-19 or in people who have received the vaccine. That hasn’t happened. Pfizer has said that the spike protein targeted by its vaccine only shared a sequence of four amino acids with syncytin-1, which is made up of 538 amino acids.
""These proteins are extremely divergent and do not look anything like one another,"" Alice Lu-Culligan, a medical student and Ph.D. candidate  in the department of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, told us. Lu-Culligan co-authored an opinion piece in the New York Times with her professor Akiko Iwasaki debunking Wodarg and Yeadon’s claim as ""completely false."" 
In addition to analyzing the amino acid sequence alignments of the coronavirus protein and the syncytin-1 protein, Lu-Culligan and Iwasaki evaluated serum from women with COVID-19. They found no reaction between antibodies for the coronavirus and the syncytin-1 protein. Lu-Culligan, who has been investigating the impact of maternal antiviral responses on fetal development during pregnancy, said that based on the history of vaccines, the plausibility of the COVID-19 vaccines leading to infertility is ""extremely unlikely."" 
Other types of vaccines are deemed safe and are recommended to those trying to conceive because they help prevent serious complications during pregnancy. Unvaccinated pregnant individuals who get infected with the flu, for example, are at risk of miscarriage, premature labor, serious lung infection and even death.
With men, experts have observed a short-term impact on sperm count, but Hariton said that’s common for other infections that cause fever.
Should Pregnant or Lactating Women Get The Vaccine?
There’s limited data on vaccine safety for pregnant women because they were excluded from the first clinical trials of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines. So for now, the recommendation for pregnant women is to discuss it with their clinical team and evaluate the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated.

Pregnant individuals are not more likely to get COVID-19, but they are at increased risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 than those who are not. According to the CDC, a pregnant COVID-19 patient is more likely to need hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation than a COVID-19 patient who’s not pregnant. Pregnant COVID-19 patients also experience preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes more frequently than healthy expecting parents.
Based on that knowledge, and the way mRNA vaccines work, experts in reproductive health from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend not withholding vaccines from pregnant and breastfeeding individuals who are eligible, and allowing patients to make their own decision. But they don’t unequivocally recommend them, as they would do with other kinds of vaccines that are proved to be safe. 
What experts know so far is that because mRNA vaccines do not contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there’s no risk for the carrier or the infant to get COVID-19. Because the body eliminates the mRNA quickly, it’s unlikely for those particles to reach the placenta. And side effects, such as fever or allergic reactions, are rare but possible. Whether maternal immune response to infection protects the fetus, remains unknown.  
""The risk of getting COVID in pregnancy puts the maternal health and the fetal health at much greater risk than any theoretical risk from vaccination,"" said Dr. Feinberg, from ASRM’s Coronavirus/COVID-19 Task Force. 
The World Health Organization guidelines for pregnant individuals are less clear. The WHO states that ""we don’t have any specific reason to believe there will be risks that would outweigh the benefits of vaccination for pregnant women"" based on the little vaccine safety data available. It says those at high risk of exposure or who have comorbidities ""may be vaccinated in consultation with their health care provider.""
According to the CDC, there are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women nor on the effects on milk production or the breastfed infant. The recommendation of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is to therefore balance potential risks with potential benefits, even though it says a vaccine is ""unlikely to have any biological effects."" 
""During lactation, it is unlikely that the vaccine lipid would enter the bloodstream and reach breast tissue. If it does, it is even less likely that either the intact nanoparticle or mRNA transfer into milk. In the unlikely event that mRNA is present in milk, it would be expected to be digested by the child and would be unlikely to have any biological effects,"" a statement on its website reads. 
On the other hand, the ABM says ""antibodies and T-cells stimulated by the vaccines may passively transfer into milk"" and protect the infant from infection. 
A recent post viewed by over 88,000 people, baselessly claims that the vaccine is causing miscarriages and premature births. The article posted on Feb. 23 by Children’s Health Defense — an organization founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was banned from Instagram for spreading vaccine misinformation — uses unsubstantiated information attributed to the National Vaccine Information Center, which is not an official government agency, as we have reported before, but an antivaccine organization.
According to the publication, the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has received 111 reports of adverse reactions to the vaccine in pregnant individuals. But the story cites data published by MedAlerts, an alternative to VAERS search engine run by the National Vaccine Information Center, not the CDC. In any case, as we’ve explained before, VAERS data is unvetted and raw. Anyone can submit a report, but that doesn’t mean the adverse event or illness can be linked to the vaccines as reports could be incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental or unverifiable.
On Feb. 26, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, with the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force Vaccine Safety Team, said there had been 154 reports of adverse reactions in pregnant women to VAERS and 55 million vaccine doses administered as of Feb. 16.
Most of those events, 73%, were not specifically related to pregnancy — such as headache,  fatigue, chills, pain in extremity, nausea, dizziness or injection site pain. Of the 42 events directly related to pregnancy, 29 were spontaneous abortions or miscarriage. But according to Shimabukuro’s presentation to a panel discussing the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine candidate, that number was in line with pregnancy loss for the general population. Early pregnancy loss for women aged 20-30 years is 9% to17%, with that rate increasing sharply from 20% at age 35, to 40% at age 40, and 80% at age 45. The median maternal age in the VAERS reports was 33. 
""The frequency of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage is actually quite common , 10 to 20% based on age,"" he said. ""The number was not concerning considering the expected background rate."" 
On Feb. 10, the National Institutes of Health called for greater inclusion of pregnant and lactating people in COVID-19 vaccine research. Reproductive health experts have also advocated to include pregnant individuals in vaccine trials in order to have more data for people to make informed decisions. On Feb. 18, Pfizer and BioNTech announced they would start evaluating their vaccine in pregnant individuals. The goal is to enroll a total of about 4,000 healthy pregnant people in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, South Africa, U.K. and Spain. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the third COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized by the FDA, is also planning to include pregnant women in their trials. 
""More research needs to be done, and we are doing that research,"" Hariton, who is part of a team at the University of California, San Francisco, conducting a nationwide study on pregnancy and COVID-19, told us. They are trying to recruit 10,000 pregnant individuals. 
""That being said, we don’t know about the long-term effects of COVID and we don’t know about the long-term effects of the vaccine, but it is much more likely that the long-term effects of COVID are going to be much worse than the long-term effects of the vaccines,"" he said.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ recommends that pregnant women who choose to get vaccinated should get their shots in authorized sites, complete the two-dose series with the same vaccine product, refrain from getting other vaccines 14 days before and after the COVID-19 vaccine, and to treat any fever following vaccination with acetaminophen.
Update, Feb. 26: We added information from the CDC on adverse events reported by pregnant women who received a COVID-19 vaccine.
Update, March 3: We updated this story with some information about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

		Sen. Bernie Sanders wrongly claimed President Donald Trump said if people have symptoms of the new coronavirus infection, ""doesn’t matter, go to work."" That’s not what the president said.
Trump was making the point that infections are likely to go unreported by many who may experience only mild symptoms, opt not to go to a doctor and then get better — including some who may continue to go to work. As a result, Trump said, the rate of deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, may appear to be higher because of the unreported cases.
Some may fault Trump for not immediately noting — as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has — that people who experience symptoms are encouraged not to go to work. But Trump was not recommending that people with coronavirus infections go to work.
Sanders’ comments came during a Fox News town hall on March 9 when he was asked to assess Trump’s handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Sanders said the fast-spreading virus — which has now been declared a pandemic — demonstrates why Medicare for All is a good idea.
""You have got millions of people in this country today who may feel that they have a symptom, but you know what? They cannot afford to go to a doctor. And then they are going to go to work,"" Sanders said. ""We have a president of the United States, you know, ‘Doesn’t matter, go to work.’ We have a president who says absurd things. So, what we need to do is, right now make it clear that all Americans, if you are feeling sick, go to a doctor. It will be paid for. Don’t hesitate to go to the doctor."" (See the 4:05 mark of the video.)
About a minute later, Sanders mocked the president for saying he has a ""natural ability"" to understand the problem.
""You don’t say stupid things,"" Sanders said. ""You don’t suggest to people that you can go to work. That’s not what the scientists and what the doctors are saying.""
Sanders isn’t the only one who has characterized Trump’s words this way. For example, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth tweeted: ""As a general rule, you shouldn’t trust what President Trump says. With the coronavirus, it could be dangerous to your health. Don’t go to work if you are sick.""
But Trump never said that sick people should go to work.
Trump made the comments in question in a telephone interview on March 4 with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, when the president called the World Health Organization estimate that 3.4% of reported COVID-19 patients worldwide have died ""a false number."" As we wrote, that’s not a false number, although experts say Trump has a point that the fatality rate may ultimately be quite a bit less than 3.4%, because the WHO’s rate does not take into account unreported cases. Trump’s point was that there are likely a lot of unreported cases.
Trump, March 4: Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people. So, you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and — or virus. So you just can’t do that. So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California — I believe you had one in New York — you know, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4%, which is a very high number, as opposed to — as opposed to a fraction of 1%. But, again, they don’t know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don’t go to the hospital.
Trump did not say that people experiencing symptoms of the virus should go to work. Rather, he was saying that cases will go unreported because many people will not go to a doctor; they will simply allow the illness to take its course and get better.
After some TV commentators criticized the president’s comment, Trump tweeted that he ""NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.""
To be clear, the CDC has recommended that employers ""actively encourage sick employees to stay home.""
According to the CDC, ""Employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are recommended to stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4° F [37.8° C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants).""
Some may fault Trump for not echoing those warnings to workers and employers when he made his comments on Fox News, but his point was not that people with symptoms should go to work, only that some with mild symptoms will.

		President Donald Trump and other officials misleadingly suggested that tech behemoth Google was working on a screening website that large numbers of Americans could soon use to see if they should be tested for the new coronavirus. The website, however, is actually a project of Google’s sister company Verily and is initially limited to the San Francisco Bay Area.
Trump first mentioned the project in a March 13 press conference in the Rose Garden.
Trump, March 13: I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.
We have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the — this country in large part. So the world, by the way — we’re not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country. Stores in virtually every location.
Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They’ve made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this.
Trump never explicitly said the website would soon be available to all Americans, but he strongly implied as much by touting the speed of development, noting the numerous testing locations covering ""this country in large part,"" and by mentioning Google’s engineers and the ""overriding goal"" to ""help all Americans"" in the same breath.
A bit later in the press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx also indicated that the website was part of a larger effort when she unveiled a flow chart and spoke about a ""new approach to testing"" involving the alleged Google website. 
Birx, March 13: So we want to also announce this new approach to testing, which will start in the screening website up here, facilitated by Google, where clients and patients and people that have interest can go, fill out a screening questionnaire — move down for symptoms or risk factors, yes. They would move down this and be told where the drive-thru options would be for them to receive this test. The labs will then move to the high-throughput automated machines to be able to provide results in 24 to 36 hours.
Less than an hour after the press conference, Google tweeted a clarifying statement from Verily, the Google-adjacent company responsible for the screening website.
""We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing,"" the company said, referring to the name of the disease caused by the new virus. ""Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.""
It should be noted that while Verily is linked to Google, it is not the same entity. Verily is a life sciences and health care subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Reuters reported that some Google employees are assisting Verily, but the company did not share any numbers. The 1,700 engineers Trump cited is likely incorrect, as per the New York Times, that figure is the number of employees who said the day before that they would be willing to volunteer for the project.
In a series of tweets the next day, Google said it was ""fully aligned"" with the U.S. government on limiting the spread of the coronavirus, and announced that it was partnering with the government to develop a nationwide website ""that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information."" 
But such a site bears no resemblance to what Trump and Birx previously announced. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai gave more details in a March 15 blog post, saying the website would be ""dedicated to COVID-19 education, prevention, and local resources nationwide"" and would include ""best practices on prevention, links to authoritative information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and helpful tips and tools from Google for individuals, teachers and businesses.""
And indeed, the Verily project ""to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area"" was described separately.
Trump, however, pointed to those tweets as vindication. In an evening press briefing on March 15, Trump held up a printout of those tweets and let it drop to the ground while criticizing the press and claiming he was supported by Google’s statements.
Trump, March 15: I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, said — called us and he apologized. I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know — this is from Google — they put out a release. And you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out — and I’m sure you’ll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful.
A few hours earlier, Trump had retweeted the Google thread and falsely said the news media ""never called Google.""
Contrary to Trump’s claims, none of Google’s statements support anything other than the idea that Verily was working on a screening survey that would at first be limited to the Bay Area — a fact that Trump never acknowledged in any of the briefings, although Vice President Mike Pence allowed as much in a March 14 briefing. 
In a March 15 blog post, Verily said it would have a Bay Area rollout for its triage tool on March 16, but didn’t mention plans to expand outside of California. ""Ultimately, our goal is to help local authorities expand testing access in California as the need continues to increase,"" the post reads. ""The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites.""
That’s not to say that a national rollout isn’t possible — in statements to other journalists, Verily spokespeople have vaguely said that the company hopes to broaden the effort. But the company has remained noncommittal and has not released a timetable. 
We reached out to Google, Verily and Verily’s Project Baseline, which is in charge of the project, and did not receive replies.
As of March 16, the online screener is available to Californians in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties only.
Trump is also wrong to say that journalists ""never called Google."" Many, in fact, did, which is why numerous news articles include statements and other comments from Verily. 
The New York Times said that Google officials directed its questions about the project to Verily, ""where a spokeswoman said the company was merely ‘in the early stages of development.’"" TechCrunch said that it contacted Google ""a few minutes"" after Trump’s comments, and it took Verily nearly two hours to respond. Reuters quoted two Verily spokeswomen. And the Verge reported that the communications lead for Verily said the triage website was initially meant for health care workers, not the general public. ""Now that it has been announced the way it was, however,"" the Verge article notes, ""anybody will be able to visit it, she said.""

      Q&A on COVID-19 Antibody Tests

		Much of the focus on COVID-19 testing thus far into the pandemic has been on tests that can determine whether someone is actively infected with the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. But, in his drive to ""open up America again,"" President Donald Trump has turned his attention to blood-based antibody tests, which can show whether someone was previously infected with the virus.
""This will help us assess the number of cases that have been asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and support our efforts to get Americans back to work by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful immunity,"" Trump said at an April 17 press conference.
The tests do have the potential to relay valuable information about who might already have immunity and how widely COVID-19 has spread. But so far, the tests are not widely available — and many of those that are available do not work as advertised. 
The U.K., for instance, spent $20 million on antibody tests from China that the government subsequently found were not accurate enough to use. An emergency room in Laredo, Texas, also dropped half a million dollars on tests from China that were too unreliable to deploy.
Other tests are better but, like any test, will still miss some people who have antibodies or incorrectly tag others as having antibodies when they don’t. And more fundamentally, experts told us too little is known about how the immune system responds to the new virus to know for sure whether antibodies actually protect a person from contracting the disease.
We’ll run through how the tests work and why it’s so hard to interpret what the results might mean.
What are antibodies and why is it useful to check for them?
Antibodies are specialized proteins that help clear the body of invading microbes. Made by immune cells known as B cells shortly after infection, antibodies specifically recognize pathogens, binding to the surfaces of viruses and stopping them from entering cells, for example, or marking them for destruction by other parts of the immune system.
The proteins don’t exist until at least a few days into an acute infection, and often aren’t detectable until a week or more after symptoms appear, Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us.
But because some antibodies persist for months if not years after someone has recovered, they offer a glimpse into the past — and can reveal whether someone was previously infected, potentially even if that person never had symptoms.
The earliest antibodies that B cells pump out  — known as immunoglobulin M, or IgM — may overlap with infection, Sampath said. IgM antibodies bind a bit less well to pathogens, but are the first on the scene, peaking within several weeks or so and then declining. The most common antibody, IgG, takes longer to ramp up, but is more finely tuned to recognize microbes and is longer-lasting. Other antibody types, including IgA, which is present in the respiratory tract, are also delayed.
Because of the time lag, antibody tests are not very good at determining whether someone is infected with SARS-CoV-2.
""The antibody test by itself cannot tell you whether you’re currently active with a live infection or not,"" said Sampath. ""You could be. You cannot rule it out. But it’s also possible that what you had was a past infection, as recently as a few days ago.""
For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration says antibody tests should not be used as ""the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19."" Molecular tests, which check for the presence of viral RNA, are needed to diagnose an infection.
It’s worth mentioning that different antibodies have different functions, and most antibody tests cannot discriminate between those that may be able to bind to the virus, but aren’t able to prevent infection the way so-called neutralizing antibodies can.
""These tests are just looking for the presence of antibodies that are able to recognize SARS-CoV-2,"" said Lisa Gralinski, a virologist who studies human coronaviruses at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""They’re not telling us anything about the quality of those antibodies, so we don’t know if they’re neutralizing.""
""Usually we would expect that they are, but in the case of an ongoing pandemic,"" she added, ""we don’t want to be providing people with false confidence or incorrect information.""
This is one reason why health experts have been cautious about making sweeping claims that antibody tests can necessarily identify those who are immune, even if scientists think it’s highly likely that a person with antibodies will have at least partial immunity for some period of time.
In the context of the current pandemic, a person’s antibodies may also be valuable as a possible COVID-19 treatment. Scientists are exploring delivering antibody-rich blood, or what’s called convalescent plasma, from people who recovered from COVID-19 to help patients still struggling with the disease.
How do COVID-19 antibody tests work?
Precisely because antibodies are highly specific and bind to certain features of a pathogen — for example, the spike protein that sticks out from the surface of the COVID-19 virus — it’s possible to design tests that can fish them out and say whether a person has them in their blood. (Antibody tests are also known as serological tests, since antibodies are found in the serum portion of the blood.)
As Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security explains, this can be done in the lab with what’s called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA. Scientists attach some SARS-CoV-2 surface protein to a plastic plate, then add a bit of patient serum. If there are antibodies in the serum that recognize the virus’s surface protein, they will stick to the protein, which can then be seen by adding a lab antibody that recognizes human antibodies and has the ability to trigger a color change. 
Other tests try to do something similar, but in a more user-friendly platform. Many rapid serology tests, for instance, look a bit like pregnancy tests, but instead of using a urine sample, require the user to add a small amount of blood. As the liquid moves through the test strip, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, if present, encounter viral proteins, and can even be sorted according to whether they are IgM or IgG, with a positive result popping up as a colored band.
The rapid tests typically take 10-30 minutes per sample, whereas the lab-based ELISAs take several hours, but can test many samples at once.
How accurate are COVID-19 antibody tests?
Poor accuracy has plagued many of the first tests that companies developed. Sampath said the problems boil down to bad reagents, or the materials the tests use, and a general lack of validation to know whether the tests work.
""Many of the tests that came out initially came out in a hurry,"" he said. ""And many of them were not tested widely. They were tested on a very small set of, let’s say, highly positive patients that may have looked like this was really good. But now, when you start testing them on a broader population, you start finding that they didn’t really have the performance that was needed.""
One issue, Sampath said, is that some tests, especially the rapid ones, may be falsely detecting antibodies to other coronaviruses, including those that cause common colds. That could yield a high false positive rate, which could be dangerous if people are led to believe they might be immune. Tests, too, may not be sensitive enough to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies when they are present, producing false negatives.
Indeed, the two measures that dictate how reliable a test is are sensitivity, or how many people are correctly labeled as having antibodies, and specificity, or how many people are correctly told they lack them.
Many manufacturers report these figures based on small-scale, in-house tests, but those reports may not reflect reality on the ground, as some governments have found. 
In one preliminary evaluation, posted as a preprint to medRxiv, nine commercially available rapid tests were found to miss as many as 35% to 45% of samples that were positive. The rapid tests generally produced fewer false positives — 7% or less — but even that performance may not be good enough, especially if the tests are used in a population in which few people have been infected.
This gets at a strange quirk of testing, in which test performance depends not just on the quality of the test, but also on the population it’s being tested in. A test that’s 95% specific, for example, might sound pretty good, but if only 1% of people are infected, then 85% of the positive results could be wrong.
Sampath’s organization, FIND, is working on independently evaluating a variety of antibody tests. The FDA is also partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to assess serological tests. According to a CDC website, results are expected in late April.
Sampath, however, said he thought it would still be several months before there would be enough data on tests used for patient management. And until then, many bad tests are still out there. ""Many of those tests are still circulating,"" he said, ""and many of them continue to add to this noise and confusion.""
What’s the status of COVID-19 antibody tests in the U.S.?
For most people, antibody tests are not yet available, although numerous companies are now making them, and some cities are beginning to roll out tests to determine how many people in the community have already been infected.
As of April 24, the FDA has given emergency use authorization, or EUA, to four antibody tests, including a point-of-care cartridge test from Cellex, a lab-based ELISA from Mount Sinai and a high-throughput test from Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. 
Many more antibody tests are on the market, but have not received an EUA. The FDA permits this under a special emergency policy, as long as the test is validated by the manufacturer and test results do not claim the ability to diagnose COVID-19. At this time, the FDA does not allow any serological tests to be performed at home, so all tests must be conducted in clinical labs or by health care workers. 
One such non-EUA test is from Abbott, which runs on existing machines in hospitals and reference labs, and has been mentioned by name by the president. The company has said it expects to be able to ship 4 million tests by the end of April and 20 million tests per month, starting in June.
Experts, however, are skeptical that companies will be able to meet the demand for serological tests anytime soon. ""We’re really entering into this era of antibody testing, and we’re not anywhere close to where we need to be,"" said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a press call. ""It’s really going to make the demand for PCR testing look minimal,"" he added, referring to the molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19.
Sampath also warned that none of the tests had been fully vetted yet. ""Even the EUA, it’s a really quick and dirty way of getting something in front of the FDA for an evaluation. It’s not a true FDA-approved test that they would normally do.""
And while some of the tests may work fine, Sampath said there was too little data to go on.
""There are perhaps a handful of tests that may be on the border of being good enough, but we don’t know,"" he said. ""And we don’t know that because we only have the manufacturer’s claim."" 
Will someone be protected from being infected again if they have antibodies to the virus?
It’s quite likely that someone with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will have some degree of immunity to the virus because it’s a sign the body has seen and responded to the pathogen before and because it’s typical of most viruses that spark short-term infections.
""Generally we know with infections like this, that at least for a reasonable period of time, you’re going to have antibody levels that will be protective,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in an April 8 interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Scientists nevertheless caution that protection is not a given. UNC’s Gralinski said immunity would be ""very likely,"" but because the virus is new — and there isn’t direct evidence yet — it can’t be known for certain.

The World Health Organization also warned against assuming antibodies confer immunity to the virus. Noting in an April 24 scientific brief that there has yet to be any study showing that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 prevent a second infection in humans, the group advised against policies that use antibody tests to identify individuals with immunity.


""At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an ‘immunity passport’ or ‘risk-free certificate,'"" the WHO said. ""People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice. The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission.""

Reports out of South Korea and other parts of Asia have raised concerns about reinfection or viral reactivation — a term usually reserved for when viruses go dormant inside cells — since some people who recovered from COVID-19 have tested positive again for the virus.
But many scientists are doubtful of those claims. Gralinski said coronaviruses don’t reactivate, and rather than people becoming reinfected, it’s more likely that as patients eliminate the virus from their bodies, the amount of swabbed virus hovers around the diagnostic test’s threshold of detection.
""My suspicion is that we’re dealing with sensitivity issues, where people are kind of on the low edge of detectability with their infection as they’re clearing virus,"" she said. ""When they’re dancing around the detection limit for virus positivity, it’s easy to have things go down for a couple of days and then come back up.""
Many other questions about potential COVID-19 immunity remain, including what antibody level might be needed to confer protection and whether people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 but never developed symptoms are any less protected than those with more severe cases.
How long might someone be immune to COVID-19?
Scientists can’t know with any certainty how long someone who contracted COVID-19 might be protected, but they can look to other human coronaviruses for clues. 
In one experiment, volunteers were intentionally infected with a coronavirus that causes a common cold, and after a year, some participants were susceptible to infection again, although many did not develop noticeable symptoms.
Other studies of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003 indicate antibodies begin to wane after about four months, but stick around in most people for two years. By year three, though, up to a quarter of patients no longer had detectable antibodies, and after six years, almost no one did.
If SARS-CoV-2 behaves like its predecessor, Gralinski said it might be possible to expect perhaps a couple of years of immunity, but not much more.
""Reasonable guesses are that on the short end there might be partial protection for about a year or close to a year. And on the long end it might be longer — it might be several years of good protection,"" said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist and director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, in a call with reporters. ""But it’s really speculative at this point.""
It’s worth noting that immune protection doesn’t just stem from circulating antibodies, nor is it a simple on or off switch. As Vineet Menachery, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Texas, explained in a Twitter thread, there are other ways the body remembers the pathogens it has encountered. This includes so-called memory cells that can swing into action more quickly if a microbe returns. So, even if a person loses their neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and can become reinfected, they’re likely to at least be less sick the second time around.
What do antibody studies say so far about how much COVID-19 has spread?
In the U.S., a few so-called serosurvey or seroprevalence studies are beginning to be done that get at how many people in certain areas have already been infected.
Many of the results, however, are highly preliminary or lack sufficient detail for scientists to fully understand them.
New York state, for example, announced on April 23 that of its first phase of 3,000 antibody tests, 13.9% were positive, with a higher 21.2% positive rate in New York City.
A small survey of 200 people in Chelsea, Massachusetts, found that 64 people, or 32%, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Another study, in Santa Clara, California, estimated that 2.5% to 4.2% of all people in the county had been infected with COVID-19, and suggested that the number of COVID-19 cases could be some 50 to 85 times higher than the confirmed count.
The Santa Clara work, however, which has not yet been peer-reviewed and was posted to the preprint site medRxiv, has been heavily criticized for its data analysis and its methodology. Critics argue the population sample, which was recruited from Facebook, may have been biased, and that statistically, the researchers can’t actually rule out that all of the positive antibody tests were false positives.
Experts say it’s important that these studies be done, but some are worried that they are not being done carefully enough. As A. Marm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies infectious disease dynamics, said on Twitter of the Santa Clara study, ""We need these kinds of studies and data badly. Unfortunately this paper is badly misleading.""
Part of the reason why it’s so important is because the information can be used to make a more accurate estimate of how dangerous COVID-19 is. If far more people have been infected than expected, that would lower estimates of how deadly COVID-19 is, which could influence public policy decisions about how important it is to keep instituting stringent physical distancing and other public health measures.
The other main reason to keep tabs on the figure is because it can say how close a community might be to achieving herd immunity, or the point at which people who are susceptible to the virus can still be protected because so many other people around them are already immune. This is based on how contagious a disease is, and since people with SARS-CoV-2 infect an average of two to three other people, you’d need around 50% to 67% of the population to be immune to get herd immunity.
No results yet indicate any population is close to that. And in fact, most studies from around the world have suggested relatively few people have contracted COVID-19.
As the WHO noted on April 20, many studies indicate only 2% to 3% of people have been infected.
""We absolutely must remain vigilant because what we’re learning from … these early serologic studies, even with all of their faults and all of the limitations,"" said WHO scientist Maria Van Kerkhove, is that ""a lower proportion of people are actually, it appears, are infected. And that means a large proportion of the public remains susceptible.""
Update, April 27: We updated the article to include a scientific briefing released by the WHO.

		Quick Take
A widely shared video, featuring a doctor falsely claiming hydroxychloroquine is a ""cure"" for COVID-19, ignited an online storm that resulted in the video being pulled by social media platforms. There is no known cure for COVID-19, and current scientific evidence hasn’t found that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment.
Full Story
A video pushing the use of an unproven COVID-19 treatment has received widespread attention, including on Twitter by President Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr., whose account was temporarily suspended for directly sharing the video.
Twitter, YouTube and Facebook have been removing the video since it started circulating on July 27 and amassing millions of views. The video spreads the debunked claim that COVID-19 can be cured with hydroxychloroquine — the drug that has been continuously touted by the president.
The clip features a Houston-area doctor named Stella Immanuel wearing a white coat in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building as she proclaims that a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and the antibiotic azithromycin has cured COVID-19 patients.
Immanuel was speaking at a press conference arranged by an organization called ""America’s Frontline Doctors."" We couldn’t find much information about the group and neither its founder, Simone Gold, nor its lawyer, Steven Mitby, returned our calls for comment. But the group appears to be connected to the Tea Party Patriots Foundation, which runs the conservative Tea Party movement. The group’s logo and an open letter to Trump written by Gold are featured on a webpage copyrighted by the foundation.
Gold is a licensed doctor in California, although it appears that she most recently ran a concierge medical business, which she described on her website as working ""the same way as a highly effective Fortune 100 CEO."" Her website says Gold ""reads the latest research, consults with the foremost experts, and examines the scientific literature"" to provide ""very high quality CEO-level information to her client-patients.""
However, in April, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the U.S., Gold stood outside the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles wearing a white coat embroidered with her name above the words ""Emergency Dept."" and recorded videos about her ""experience practicing emergency medicine in this era of the COVID-19 crisis.""
In one video she claimed ""the emergency department volume is down."" In another video in front of the hospital, she reported that, ""we have been very successful at flattening the curve.""
But Gold has never worked at the hospital. In fact, the only time she was affiliated in any way with Cedars-Sinai was when she worked on a per-diem basis in a Cedars-Sinai Medical Network urgent care clinic for less than three weeks in 2015, Sally Stewart, a spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai told FactCheck.org in an email.
Immanuel has an equally opaque background, and she didn’t return our calls either.
Immanuel is a licensed doctor in Texas and lists her practice as the Rehoboth Medical Center. That medical center is listed as being registered with the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts in September 2019 by Solange Gabice. We reached Gabice by phone, but she hung up when we asked if her clinic was treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine.
It’s worth noting also that the same strip mall in Katy, Texas, that houses the clinic also houses Fire Power Ministries, a Christian ministry run by Immanuel.
During a July 28 press briefing, the day after the video went up, Trump questioned why social media platforms had been removing it. ""They’re very respected doctors,"" the president said. 
When a reporter asked him about Immanuel, who also has claimed that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens, Trump noted that she appeared with several other doctors. 
""I thought she was very impressive in the sense that she came — I don’t know which country she comes from — but she said that she’s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients,"" he said. ""And I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.""
Hydroxychloroquine Not a COVID-19 ‘Cure’
In the video, Immanuel repeats the word ""cure"" a half-dozen times when referring to using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, saying it can prevent any COVID-19 deaths.
""Nobody needs to get sick. This virus has a cure,"" she says at one point. ""It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax."" (Zithromax is a brand name for the drug azithromycin.)
First of all, there is no known ""cure"" for COVID-19, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points out. And the current scientific evidence doesn’t support the conclusion that hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating the disease, as we’ve explained before.
Since early in the novel coronavirus pandemic, hydroxychloroquine — a drug that is used to treat malaria and other illnesses — has been touted as a potential treatment. Trump has repeatedly cited it, at one point referring to it as a ""game changer.""
But numerous randomized controlled studies have cast serious doubt on its effectiveness when it comes to COVID-19.
""There are no data from randomized clinical trials that demonstrate effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for COVID,"" Dr. Neil Schluger, chairman of the department of medicine at New York Medical College School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. Schluger has studied hydroxychloroquine in relation to COVID-19. ""There are now several randomized clinical trials that show that it had no effect.""
""The vast majority of expert opinions … is that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit in COVID illness,"" he added.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also said the drug is ""not effective"" for treating COVID-19 in a July 28 interview on ABC’s ""Good Morning America.""
""The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease,"" Fauci said. 
As we’ve reported before, the Food and Drug Administration had issued an emergency use authorization in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile ""when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.""
Amid growing evidence the drug is not effective, the FDA announced in June that it had revoked the EUA for the drugs because they are ""unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,"" and that the ""known and potential benefits"" of the drugs ""no longer outweigh"" the risks — which can include ""serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.""
A large randomized controlled study called RECOVERY, in the U.K., reported in a preprint, which hasn’t been peer-reviewed, that hydroxychloroquine wasn’t associated with reduced mortality — and was actually associated with ""an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death."" The study said that 26.8% of the 1,561 patients given hydroxychloroquine died within 28 days, whereas 25% of patients given usual care died in that time span — a difference that was not statistically significant.
The authors wrote that ""these results indicate that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.""
Another study published July 16 in the Annals of Internal Medicine — a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that involved more than 400 participants  — found that ""[h]ydroxychloroquine did not substantially reduce symptom severity in outpatients with early, mild COVID-19.""
There was one observational study by the Henry Ford Health System, published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases on July 1, that found hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. But, as we’ve explained before, the study has limitations — and it stands in contrast to multiple randomized controlled trials that have found the drug is not beneficial to hospitalized patients (and two other observational studies).
During the press conference, Immanuel also claimed that a 2005 study ""said it works.""
That study — which found that ""[c]hloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV in cell culture"" — ""is no evidence at all that it’s a cure for COVID,"" Schluger said.
""That was a different coronavirus; that was the coronavirus that causes SARS,"" he said. Secondly, he said, the study involved cells in test tubes. Potential drugs are evaluated in test tubes, then in animals, before they move into the three phases of clinical human trials, he said — and 90% of drug candidates that make it to human trials fail because they aren’t effective or aren’t safe.
A study in a test tube involving a different virus, Schluger added, is ""not how the FDA approves drugs.""
Likewise, Dr. Radha Rajasingham, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases and international medicine at the University of Minnesota, told us in an email that ""[w]hen something ‘works’ in cell culture, the next step is to test it in animals, and then in humans to prove efficacy in this setting. Thus, it’s not reasonable to make clinical decisions based on one lab-based study.""
Despite the evidence that hydroxychloroquine isn’t an effective treatment for COVID-19, Immanuel in the video generally dismisses such studies (erroneously suggesting that they only involved ""20 people, 40 people"") — and claims she has successfully treated more than 350 patients.
She also says: ""I’ve put myself, my staff and many doctors that I know on hydroxychloroquine for prevention. Because by the very mechanism of action, it works early and as a prophylaxis.""
There are scientists exploring the use of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis, or preventive, and some results have been published.
Rajasingham and fellow researchers at the University of Minnesota published the results of a post-exposure prophylaxis randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3.
The double-blind trial recruited more than 800 volunteers who received either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within four days of exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly 12% of hydroxychloroquine participants developed a COVID-19-like illness compared with 14.3% of those getting the placebo — a difference that was not significant.
Rajasingham said her group is currently analyzing the results of a trial that looks at hydroxychloroquine as a pre-exposure prophylaxis, involving 1,500 health care workers. 
""But without clear evidence that this works in randomized clinical trials (in humans) I would not believe this medicine is efficacious,"" she said.
Schluger said he understands why the public is desperate for an answer, and why some might look to hydroxychloroquine. But ""the job of doctors and scientists is to figure out if things really work — and as far as we can tell, hydroxychloroquine doesn’t seem to have any significant effect.""
He said doctors like Immanuel should submit their evidence for peer-review and ""see if it stands up to scrutiny.""
Recommendations for Face Masks
At one point in the video, Immanuel claims, ""you don’t need masks, there is a cure."" Immanuel and the doctors behind her in the video are not seen wearing face masks.
There is no cure, as we said. And the CDC has explained that face masks or coverings could help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus by containing respiratory droplets created when people cough, sneeze or talk. That’s how the virus is primarily spread and containing fluids is called source control.
The CDC has been recommending the use of face coverings since early April, when the agency changed its initial position on the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing new studies on the transmission of the novel coronavirus.
We’ve written numerous stories explaining that guidance and correcting misinformation on the issue, but bogus claims like Immanuel’s continue to add to the confusion.
We’ve written before that there have been relatively few randomized controlled trials looking at the efficacy of face masks when worn by the public, and the ones that have been done are inconsistent or have not observed large effects. But given lab studies of how masks work, many experts support them, and the World Health Organization has, like the CDC, recommended their use during ""severe epidemics or pandemics.""

		Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending that members of the public mask up last spring, additional research has backed the use of face masks to combat the coronavirus. While knowledge gaps still remain, experts agree that masks should be used — and increasingly, they are emphasizing the use of better masks.

In our last deep dive into the research on masks in April 2020, we explained that there were some lab studies that supported the idea that masks would be effective against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. But direct evidence that face masks prevent transmission of respiratory viruses in a community was limited.
In some ways, that basic takeaway hasn’t changed much. Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, told us that ""there is good mechanistic evidence from laboratory studies that masks should have an effect on transmission"" and that ""evidence from randomized trials has not been consistent with a large effect of masks on transmission, but has been consistent with a small effect of masks on transmission.""
""I continue to believe that mask use will reduce transmission, although mask use alone is not enough to prevent COVID from spreading in a community,"" he said in an email.
Some experts remain skeptical that masks — at least the ones used by most people today — have much effect on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although they still think people should wear them.
Lisa Brosseau, an industrial hygienist consulting with the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, doesn’t discount face coverings entirely, but cautions against relying on them. And she thinks people — especially workers potentially exposed for many hours while on the job — should have access to improved ventilation and other preventive measures, along with significantly better masks.
""We, as a society, have been wearing leaky masks,"" said John Volckens, an aerosol scientist at Colorado State University who has studied mask performance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""And leaky masks provide much less protection than high-quality, good filter, well-fitting masks.""
The CDC issued new recommendations in February to encourage people to improve the fit and filtration of their masks. Drawing on the findings of lab experiments, the agency suggested layering a cloth mask over a disposable one — a form of ""double-masking"" — or using a mask fitter or brace, among other options.
Newer Research
Over the last year, additional research has generally supported the notion that face masks can reduce transmission of the virus, although proof is still lacking. 
Numerous lab studies, for example, show that masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads — and may offer some protection to the wearer.
In one study, scientists at the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health tested a variety of face coverings for their ability to prevent the outward spread of particles from a simulated cough. N95 respirators performed the best — blocking 99% of the particles — while medical masks blocked 59% and a cloth mask blocked 51%. The only covering that failed to do much of anything was a face shield, which stopped just 2%. 
In another experiment, researchers in Japan evaluated how well different masks on two mannequins that faced one other reduced exposure to the coronavirus. Cotton or surgical masks on the mannequin releasing the virus cut the amount of exposure to the other by 50% or more. If only the exposed mannequin wore such a mask, the protective effect was smaller, but if both wore a mask, transmission decreased by 60% to 70%.
A few epidemiology studies also point to face masks helping to reduce spread of the coronavirus. According to a study of 124 households in Beijing, China, mask-wearing prior to when an infected family member fell ill was associated with a 79% lower risk of spreading the virus to others in the household. 
And in an analysis of more than 1,000 people in Thailand who had been in contact with someone with COVID-19, those who reported wearing a mask at all times during that contact were 77% less likely to become infected than those who did not wear masks.
Other indirect evidence comes from studies that have documented associations between self-reported mask wearing and control of the virus in a community, or the implementation of a mask mandate and a subsequent decline in COVID-19 cases or rates of hospitalization.
One study of 15 states and Washington, D.C., identified a 0.9% drop in the daily growth of COVID-19 cases in the first five days following the mask mandate, which grew to a 2.0% daily decrease after 21 days. 
In Kansas, which instituted a mask mandate in July but allowed counties to opt out, the number of new COVID-19 cases per capita fell by 6% in areas with mask mandates, but rose by 100% in those without.
Another study in the U.S. did not identify an impact of a mask mandate, but found that a 10% increase in self-reported mask usage was associated with a state being 3.5 times more likely to have control of its epidemic.
One potentially telling example of the power of masks comes from a report about two hair stylists in Missouri. Both had symptoms of COVID-19 but wore masks and are not known to have spread the virus to any of their clients, who also were masked. Of the 139 total customers, 67 agreed to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all came back negative.
Each of these studies has limitations. In the hairdresser study, for example, there’s no way to know if masks were the reason why none of the hairdressers’ clients subsequently developed COVID-19 — and it’s possible some of the people who declined to be tested did in fact contract the virus from those interactions.
Similarly, the studies reporting associations between mask use or mask mandates and better COVID-19 metrics also can’t show that masks necessarily drove or contributed to those improvements.

Dr. Roger Chou, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at Oregon Health & Science University, told us that while such studies are suggestive of a benefit, it’s ""difficult to determine causality from these studies"" because it’s hard to control for other factors that impact infection rates, such as physical distancing or other public health measures.
The lab-based studies, too, can point to how and why masks would work to cut transmission of the coronavirus, but may not reflect the performance of masks of various quality against SARS-CoV-2 in the real world.
Still, for many scientists and public health agencies the data are convincing. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, two CDC scientists described the evidence as ""compelling.""
""When you put it all together,"" Volckens said, ""it’s really hard to refute that masks aren’t a vital piece of infection control.""

Chou, who is also the director of his university’s Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center, has co-authored a series of updated rapid reviews of the evidence on face masks for preventing transmission of respiratory viruses, including the coronavirus. While his reviews have concluded that the traditional epidemiological evidence remains limited — similar to other reviews by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control — he nevertheless said there was a consensus that masks do work.
""I have pretty high confidence that masks help protect wearers against infection and also likely provide protection from source control,"" Chou said, noting that despite differences in the way various agencies describe the evidence, he was unaware of any regional or country authority that doesn’t recommend masks at this point.
""[T]here may be some disagreements about when to wear masks and what types of masks, but whether to wear masks or not when you are in close proximity to other people is not really a question,"" he said.
One important study that both Volckens and Chou pointed to is a randomized controlled trial of face masks in Denmark — the first and so far only such study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The trial tested whether giving free surgical masks to volunteers reduced the likelihood that they would contract SARS-CoV-2, as compared with a control group that was not given masks. It failed to identify a statistically significant effect in the mask group.
But as SciCheck has explained before, the study was only designed to detect a large effect of 50% or more — and the results suggested a smaller, 18% reduction in risk. (The study, notably, also didn’t try to measure whether masks helped prevent spread of the virus from wearers to others.)
""The estimate was imprecise and not statistically significant, but it was consistent with a protective effect,"" said Chou. ""This is not large, but for a disease like SARS-CoV-2 that spreads exponentially it is important from a public health perspective.""
Cowling, the University of Hong Kong epidemiologist, told us at the time that a 20% protection level is right around what he would expect, based on past research on influenza.
Volckens added that the blue surgical masks used in the study are quite leaky — and that if better masks had been worn, he suspects the results may have been more definitive. ""They didn’t even use a great mask,"" he said, ""so it’s not surprising that they didn’t see a significant effect.""
Moving Toward Better Masks
Not everyone is convinced that face coverings have done much to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Brosseau, a retired certified industrial hygienist with expertise in respiratory protection against bioaerosols, is critical of many of the lab studies that have come out in the last year, which she says have not used rigorous methods. 
""Many of the studies that I’ve read that claim that they get very high filter efficiency on face coverings were not done correctly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""They’re done at low flow rates — the flow rates that people breathe at. But that’s actually not what you need to discriminate between a good filter and a bad filter.""
She’s also left unswayed by the epidemiological data, which are only correlational.
Brosseau’s primary concern is that people, particularly workers, are not aware of how deficient their face coverings may be, likening the usage of subpar masks to wearing a bikini outside in 10 degree weather.
""I don’t say don’t wear them, I just say don’t expect them to do much,"" she said. ""They are not as magical as everyone thinks they are.""
Cloth masks might offer some benefit for people running into a grocery store for five to 10 minutes, but for workers who are there for hours, Brosseau thinks they do little to capture or filter out the smaller respiratory particles, or aerosols, that can linger in the air and build up. That’s why she thinks more attention needs to be paid to better ventilation systems and better masks — ultimately, N95 respirators for workers and other standardized masks for the public.
On that front, ASTM International, an organization that publishes standards for personal protective equipment, released a standard for barrier face coverings in mid-February. Brosseau said it’s too early for companies to have made masks that conform to the standard, but is hopeful that it will lead to improved designs.
Volckens, the Colorado State aerosol scientist, doesn’t share Brosseau’s skepticism about face coverings, but agrees that it’s past time for people to be using better masks. 
""We haven’t been wearing enough good masks,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It really just comes down to two things: Masks that aren’t great filters and masks that are leaky. And by leaky, I mean they don’t fit to your face and so the air doesn’t go through the mask — the air goes around the mask.""
His experiments have revealed wide variability in mask performance, not only between different kinds of masks, but also in how a given mask fits or how much or how loudly someone speaks, which will vary from person to person.
As for the CDC’s new recommendations to ""double mask"" by placing a cotton mask or mask fitter over a medical mask, Volckens said the agency’s tests were ""pretty compelling,"" even if the scientists only tested a few masks and didn’t use human subjects.
""I think it confirms what many aerosol scientists have known for months, and that is that we’ve been wearing leaky masks,"" he said. ""Aerosols behave more like smoke. And no one would think that wearing one of those blue surgical masks would keep all the smoke that you would exhale if you were pulling off a cigarette.""
The idea behind the recommendation, he said, is not really that you need a second layer, but that you need something that holds down the disposable mask so it fits better.
Brosseau cautioned that adding too many layers can increase the breathing resistance — something that wasn’t measured in the study. That can make it harder for someone to breathe and more likely that a mask would leak on the side. Short of a respirator, she said adding a mask brace or fitter would be one of the better options, since that would provide a better seal without including a potentially problematic extra layer.
As more is learned, scientists say mask guidance could shift again in the future. Volckens, for example, said it’s not yet known how good is good enough when it comes to masks. And there are still many remaining unknowns about how the coronavirus spreads, including how much virus it takes to infect a person and how that might depend on particle size or the exact route the virus uses to enter the body. ""Without that information,"" he said, ""it’s really hard to make risk-based decisions.""

		Quick Take
False information that claims COVID-19 is caused by a bacteria and can be easily treated started spreading by text message, and is now viral on social media. Actually, COVID-19 is caused by a virus and there is no treatment for it.
Full Story
COVID-19 is caused by a virus that was first seen in China at the end of 2019 and has spread around the world, reaching pandemic proportions. There is currently no specific treatment for it or a vaccine to prevent it.
But a viral online claim misinforms social media users, telling them among other things: ""Covid19 is a bacterium, easily treated with aspirin and coagulant.""
The claim started spreading as a text message — a Portuguese version circulating on WhatsApp was debunked by the Brazilian fact-checking organization Agência Lupa on May 15 and another version was debunked by India Today on May 25. But it has now migrated to social media platforms, including Facebook, where it’s spreading in popular American conspiracy theory groups.
The post circulating in U.S. groups claims that Italian authorities ""allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium"" and that they discovered this when ""[t]hey went against the World Health Organization’s \’law\’ that no bodies be autopsied.""
None of that is true.
The Italian Ministry of Health describes the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, and the illness it causes, known as COVID-19, the same way as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. They all explain that the novel coronavirus is a newly recognized strain in the family of viruses known as coronaviruses, which includes the viruses that cause the common cold as well as more severe diseases, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.
The Italian ministry continues to refer to COVID-19 as a virus, not a bacteria.
Here, it’s important to understand the difference between bacteria and viruses. Bacteria are single-cell organisms that can live in various environments, including the human intestines, where they help to digest food, the Mayo Clinic explains. While some types of bacteria are harmless, or even helpful, to humans, others can cause diseases, such as strep throat. Bacterial infections can usually be treated with antibiotics.
Viruses, however, are smaller than bacteria and need a living host in order to multiply. They operate by taking over and hiding inside host cells. They cannot be treated with antibiotics.










Illustration of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The virus now known as SARS-CoV-2 was isolated on Jan. 7 in China and information about it was shared internationally for research purposes.
Illustrations of the virus have been ubiquitous over the last few months, too. They show the spiky crowns that are typical of the coronavirus family, which gets its name from the Latin word for crown.
So, the claim that Italian authorities discovered that ""Covid19 is a bacterium, easily treated with aspirin and coagulant"" is false. Not only does it misuse the name of the disease, it falsely suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a bacteria. Also, there is no treatment that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or recognized by the WHO.
The other part of the claim is also false. The WHO didn’t institute a ""\’law\’ that no bodies be autopsied.""
But the Italian Ministry of Health, which is lauded in this claim for conducting autopsies, had actually sought to limit them for COVID-19 deaths, issuing guidance on April 1 that said autopsies should not be performed on those who died with ""full-blown"" cases of COVID-19.
The WHO published guidance in March detailing precautions to be taken while performing autopsies on those who died from COVID-19.
Generally, it said, dead bodies are not infectious, but warned that some organs of a person who died during the infectious period of COVID-19 could still contain the live virus. It recommended that autopsies be performed in adequately ventilated rooms with as few people present as possible, and that they all wear appropriate personal protective equipment.

		Moderna’s mRNA vaccine is the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the U.S. Here, we give a rundown of basic facts about the vaccine and an overview of how it works.
Quick Summary
Vaccine name: mRNA-1273
Design type: mRNA
Dose number: 2 doses, 28 days apart
Efficacy: 94.1% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults two weeks or more after receipt of the second dose.
Safety: No serious safety concerns reported other than some rare allergic reactions and a likely, but rare, association with heart inflammation. The shots, however, commonly elicit reactions in people that can include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, and chills.
Expected timeline: First doses were administered beginning on Dec. 21 to prioritized populations, following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization on Dec. 18.
Operation Warp Speed involvement: The U.S. government has devoted more than $4 billion to the development, testing and manufacturing of the vaccine. The government has contracted to buy 300 million doses, with delivery of 100 million doses each by the end of March, June and July.
Storage considerations: -20°C (-4°F) for long-term storage; after thawing, vaccine vials should be stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days.
Just a week after the FDA authorized the first COVID-19 vaccine on an emergency use basis — Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA shot — the agency greenlighted a second, from the Cambridge, Massachusetts, biotech company Moderna.
Like its predecessor, the Moderna vaccine also uses an mRNA design, but it differs on the specifics, including the amount of time between doses, the amount of genetic material in each shot and the precise lipid nanoparticles that surround and protect the mRNA. That difference in fat formulation is thought to be why the Moderna vaccine doesn’t need to be kept as cold — a feature that should make it easier to distribute.
After releasing positive interim results from its phase 3 trial on Nov. 16, Moderna announced on Nov. 30 that its vaccine had an efficacy of 94.1% in preventing disease in adults. The company submitted its emergency use authorization, or EUA, application to the FDA the same day.
On Dec. 17, an external panel advising the FDA agreed the vaccine’s benefits outweighed the risks in a 20-to-0 vote, with one abstention, and the following day the agency authorized the vaccine for emergency use in people 18 years of age and older.
While the United Kingdom was the first to authorize the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the U.S. was the first country to permit the use of the Moderna vaccine, following substantial R&D and manufacturing support from the government and a collaboration with the National Institutes of Health.
Moderna Q&A
What is in the vaccine and how does it work?
As with most other COVID-19 vaccine designs, the Moderna mRNA vaccine works by triggering an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s spike protein, which sits on the surface of the virus and is what the virus uses to enter cells.
The vaccine is made of modified messenger RNA, or mRNA, wrapped in a special blend of fatty molecules known as lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make their own spike proteins, prompting the body to generate protective antibodies and activate other immune cells known as T cells. The lipids help deliver the RNA into cells and prevent it from being degraded too quickly.
Whereas the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine includes 30 micrograms of mRNA in each dose, Moderna’s shot has 100 micrograms; the two vaccines also use a different mix of lipids. These differences may explain why Moderna’s vaccine appears to produce more expected side effects than its competitor.
As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained, there is no way to catch COVID-19 from this type of vaccine because the vaccine is not made of a virus. And because the mRNA from the vaccine doesn’t enter the nucleus — the part of the cell that houses DNA — it ""does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA,"" contrary to some online rumors.
How was the vaccine developed?
The Moderna vaccine was developed in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health. Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Vaccine Research Center were already working with scientists at Moderna on an investigational vaccine to protect against MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus. As soon as the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 became available in January, the team was able to apply that knowledge to design a COVID-19 vaccine targeting the virus’s spike protein.
In mid-March, the NIH began testing three different vaccine doses in a phase 1 trial involving 45 adults 55 years of age or younger. Two doses of the inoculation triggered the expected immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses similar to those recovering from COVID-19, without raising any serious safety concerns. The trial was later expanded to include 40 older adults. 
The company launched a phase 2 trial with 600 volunteers in May to confirm the dose and continue to assess safety.
Meanwhile, a preclinical study published in July showed vaccinated monkeys that were challenged with virus rapidly cleared the pathogen from their bodies. A study published the following month found that in mice, the vaccine successfully prevented infection in the lung and nose.
A phase 3 randomized controlled trial began in late July that included just over 30,000 volunteers across 99 sites in the U.S. Enrollment was slowed in September to increase minority participation. Because the trial only included people over the age of 18, Moderna began enrolling 3,000 teens as young as 12 in a combined phase 2/3 trial in mid-December, with results expected in the spring of 2021.
How effective is the vaccine?
Moderna announced in a Nov. 30 press release that its vaccine was 94.1% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults starting two weeks after the second dose. 
As we’ve explained before, that roughly means that a vaccinated person has a 94% reduced risk of becoming sick, compared with a similar person who wasn’t immunized — although the true effectiveness of the vaccine outside of a trial may be lower. (A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in late March 2021, found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose.)
The efficacy figure is based on observing a total of 196 symptomatic COVID-19 cases, 185 of which were in the placebo group versus 11 in the vaccine group.
According to the FDA’s summary of the company’s data, the efficacy was a bit lower in adults 65 years of age or older (86.4%), although earlier interim results did not suggest any differences in efficacy across age, race and ethnicity, or gender.
The vaccine also protects against severe cases of COVID-19. In the trial, all 30 cases of severe COVID-19, including one death, occurred in the placebo group. Moderna, however, did reveal during its Dec. 17 meeting with the FDA advisory committee that there was one severe COVID-19 case in the vaccine group that had not yet been fully assessed.
It is not yet known how long the vaccine affords protection against disease or whether the vaccine can prevent infection or keep someone from transmitting the virus to others. However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others."" 
How safe is the vaccine?
No serious safety concerns were reported in the trials. As with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, however, vaccine recipients have frequently experienced temporary side effects, including pain at the site of injection, swelling of the lymph nodes in the vaccinated arm, fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, and chills.
According to the FDA’s summary, these responses are more likely after the second dose and tend to be more severe in younger adults compared with those 65 years of age or older.
While scientists say this is a sign that the shots are working as they should, these reactions can be unpleasant. 
Serious adverse events, which refer to potentially life-threatening or disabling events, occurred in 1% of participants in both the vaccine and placebo groups in the phase 3 trial. Only three such events were considered by the FDA to be likely due to the vaccine: one case of uncontrollable nausea and vomiting and two cases of facial swelling, both of which occurred in women who had had cosmetic dermal filler injections in the past six months.
A third case of facial swelling — not considered severe — also involved a woman who had previously had a dermal filler injection in her lips and had experienced a similar reaction following an influenza shot.
Similar to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, there was a slightly higher number of cases of Bell’s palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, in the vaccine group. With three instances out of more than 15,000 vaccine recipients and one in a similarly sized placebo group, the FDA was unable to determine whether the condition was triggered by the vaccine or not, but suggests ongoing surveillance.
At least a few serious allergic reactions — expected with any vaccine — have been reported with the Moderna vaccine. As of Jan. 18, there have been 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Moderna vaccine, according to the CDC. None of these cases has been fatal.
At this time, the only people the FDA says should not receive the Moderna vaccine are those who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or one of its ingredients. The CDC advises skipping the immunization if you have had an allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol, a form of which is in the vaccine, or polysorbate, which is similar to polyethylene glycol. The agency also recommends consulting with your physician if you have ever had an immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines or injectable therapies.
The Moderna vaccine may also be linked to an increased risk of rare heart inflammation in young people. In late June, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, or inflammation of the lining around the heart, in teens and young adults.
As of July 6, the agency says there have been 971 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years old or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which are through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, are with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and are more common among males and after the second dose.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, the committee said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.""

		President Donald Trump exaggerated Americans’ comparative success battling the coronavirus, falsely saying in a press briefing that the U.S. per capita death rate is lower than ""most"" of Western Europe. He also claimed a 9% decrease in COVID-19 fatalities over the past week, but the data do not show such a decline.
The president made his comments in an Aug. 10 press briefing at the White House. After noting that the U.S. has more nursing home residents than the U.K. and other European countries, he turned to mortality rates.
Trump, Aug. 10: Our country also has a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets. Yet, we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other peer nations in Western Europe. So that’s an important — we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other nations in Western Europe, and heading for even stronger numbers.
Trump is right that the U.S., which has had about 50 deaths per 100,000 people, has a lower per capita death rate from COVID-19 than the U.K., which has had 70 deaths per 100,000. But he’s wrong when he adds the same is true of ""most other nations in Western Europe.""
As of Aug. 12, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. has done better on cumulative per capita deaths than Belgium, Spain, the U.K., Italy and Sweden, as well as two tiny microstates — Andorra, located between France and Spain, and San Marino, which is surrounded by Italy.
But the U.S. also has done worse than France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Monaco, Austria, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Malta. That’s twice as many countries that outperform the U.S. on this particular death metric than those that underperform.

The following day, Trump altered his claim during a press briefing to exclude the New York tri-state area from the nation’s per capita death figures.
Trump, Aug. 11: We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-state area — which had a very, very hard time — and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill — something that the news doesn’t tell you. They don’t tell you that. They don’t like to tell you that.
It’s not clear why the president would remove New York, New Jersey and Connecticut from the country’s statistics and then compare the per capita rate to other countries that aren’t being given a similar handicap. Still, we found that when those three states are not included, the U.S.’s per capita mortality improves over only one additional country: France.
Without New York, New Jersey and Connecticut’s collective 52,794 COVID-19 deaths and nearly 32 million people, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Census Bureau figures, America’s mortality rate declines to around 37 deaths per 100,000 people. That’s better than France, but no better than the next Western European country, Ireland.
And while Trump says that the U.S. is ""heading for even stronger numbers,"" it’s worth noting that deaths per capita will only grow for nations as more deaths accumulate in ongoing outbreaks. Given that the U.S. currently has more daily per capita deaths than nearly all of Western Europe, it’s unlikely that the U.S. could improve its relative position anytime soon.
Underlying Conditions
Trump also suggests that the U.S. per capita death numbers are all the more impressive since the U.S. has ""a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets."" 
We asked the White House for support for this claim, but did not receive a reply. We did, however, find a study that found the U.S. to be similar to Europe in terms of underlying conditions that put patients at higher risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19.
The study, which was published in June in the Lancet Global Health, estimated the number of people at increased and higher risk for COVID-19 in each country, based on age, sex and underlying health conditions such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease.
The authors found that 28.5% of the U.S. population has at least one health condition and is at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, while 5.8% of the population is at high risk. Compared with Europe as a whole, the U.S. is in a slightly better position, with 31% of Europeans at increased risk and 6.4% at high risk. Some countries in Europe fare a bit better than the U.S. on both numbers, such as Iceland and Ireland, but others do not, including the Netherlands and Germany (see this Excel spreadsheet for exact numbers).
Overstating Decrease in U.S. Fatalities
Shortly after his Western Europe claim, Trump touted American progress on the coronavirus.
""Nationwide, we continue to see encouraging signs,"" he said. ""In the last seven days, nationwide cases declined by 14%, hospitalizations decreased by 7%, fatalities decreased by 9%.""
Using figures from the COVID Tracking Project, we found the president to be close on cases and hospitalizations — but off on fatalities. The seven-day average of new coronavirus cases fell 12.5% between Aug. 3 and Aug. 10, although the seven-day average of new tests also declined 6.1%. Hospitalizations dropped 7.6%.
But for fatalities, the seven-day average declined by only 11 deaths, or 1%, from a daily average of 1,056 deaths to 1,045.
The White House did not explain the 9% figure or the data used in the president’s statistics. There are various metrics one can use, and different sources of similar data, which might explain some of the discrepancy, but we found none that matched 9%.
Data from USAFacts, which provides data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, show a 0.07% decline in the seven-day average of new deaths, while the New York Times database shows a 5.5% decline. Oxford University’s Our World in Data actually shows a 1.9% increase in the seven-day average of new deaths for the same time period.
On Aug. 11, Trump modified his claim downward, saying mortality in the U.S. ""has declined by 7%."" The president isn’t explicit about the time period in question, but if he’s referring to a week-long period, as his comments suggest, data from the COVID Tracking Project show a 0.3% increase in the seven-day average in new daily deaths between Aug. 4 and Aug. 11. 
The real question is whether deaths in the U.S. are in fact trending down again, as they did in May and June, before rising in July as outbreaks swept across the South and West. And it may be too soon to tell.
As Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, previously told us, a week’s worth of data is not usually enough to establish a trend.
""[T]here can be week to week fluctuations in tests, cases and deaths, so it’s appropriate to see data from two weeks,"" she said in an email, to know if a change represents a trend.
Two weeks prior, daily deaths were slightly below where they were on Aug. 10 and 11, and the seven-day average was still on the upswing, as a graph from the COVID Tracking Project shows.

		SciCheck Digest
The COVID-19 vaccines have been shown in trials and real-world application to be safe and effective. But a paper shared widely online claimed that vaccines cause two deaths for every three lives saved. Experts say the analysis misinterpreted data and was flawed — and it has now been retracted by the journal that published it.

              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

Full Story
Unverified reports of adverse events that occur following receipt of a vaccine have been a key source of misinformation for months. As we’ve repeatedly documented, anyone can submit a report to the U.S. system and the reports alone are not proof of a link to a vaccine.
In the latest iteration of that type of data being misrepresented, a peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal used it to dubiously claim that the COVID-19 vaccines were causing deaths at such a scale that they nearly rival the number of lives saved through the vaccines.
""For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination,"" the paper, published on June 24 in Vaccines, claimed.

Days after the analysis was published — amid backlash from scientists, some of whom resigned from editorial roles with the publication — the journal issued a June 28 statement noting that there were ""significant concerns"" with the paper and that its assertion that the deaths were linked to vaccination ""is incorrect and distorted.""
""The data has been misused because it makes the (incorrect) assumption that all deaths occurring post vaccination are caused by vaccination,"" Katie Ewer, an immunologist at the University of Oxford, told Science in an email. ""[And] it is now being used by anti-vaxxers and COVID-19-deniers as evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe. [This] is grossly irresponsible, particularly for a journal specialising in vaccines.""
Vaccines, based in Switzerland, formally retracted the paper on July 2.
But in the days between its publication and retraction, the paper and its claims found a significant audience on social media, where they were spread widely across platforms.
The link to the paper was shared nearly 9,000 times on Facebook as of early July 2, according to CrowdTangle analytics data. Metrics on the journal’s site indicate it was viewed more than 367,000 times.
Liz Wheeler, a conservative commentator, promoted the paper in a June 30 video on Facebook — viewed more than 250,000 times — titled, ""The Vaccine Study You’re Not Allowed To See.""
""This is a peer-reviewed, scientific study,"" Wheeler tells her viewers. ""Essentially, this peer-reviewed scientific study shows that COVID-19 vaccine causes two deaths for every three lives it saves."" 
Behind her in parts of the video is a board repeating the study’s claim as a statement of fact: ""COVID vax kills two people for every three saved.""
As we said, the journal had acknowledged two days earlier that the data about purported deaths from the vaccines had been ""distorted.""
The paper said that the authors used ""the data of the Dutch national register … to gauge the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations.""
But the Dutch reporting system — maintained by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, called Lareb — includes a prominent disclaimer explicitly stating that a reported side effect may not be from the vaccine, similar to the adverse event reporting system used in the U.S., which we’ve explained.
Dr. Eugène van Puijenbroek, head of science and research at Lareb, told us in an email that the data used in the analysis ""were interpreted incorrectly and therefore led to erroneous conclusions."" He said he had requested that the journal ""make either an appropriate correction"" or retract the study.
The system is used to ""highlight possible safety signals at an early stage,"" he said. ""A reported event that occurred after vaccination is therefore not necessarily being caused by the vaccination, although our data was presented as being causally related by the authors. It should be noted that also the database of the European Medicines Agency that is mentioned in this article contains the same type of reports.""
""As clearly stated on our website, but not taken [into] account in the method applied in this article, death after vaccination does not imply that the adverse event is indeed the actual cause of death,"" he said. ""Existing health problems turned out to be the most obvious explanation for the fatal outcomes in the majority of cases. In a limited number of reports, adverse events following immunisation, known to be associated with the COVID vaccines (e.g. fever, nausea or malaise), may have contributed to the worsening of an already fragile health condition or an underlying medical condition. Suggesting all reports with a fatal outcome to be causally related is far from truth.""
Also, Van Puijenbroek said, the paper’s assertion that the reported deaths ""were certified by medical specialists"" is ""simply incorrect.""
The lead author of the study, Harald Walach, is a psychologist and professor at Poznan University of the Medical Sciences in Poland. He and his co-authors penned a two-page letter defending their study, published by Retraction Watch, in which they admitted ""that these data are far from perfect"" but said they were justified in using the data for analysis because ""they are the only ones that are available.""
They also claimed that ""[c]urrently we only have association, we agree, and we never said anything else.""
There were other issues with the paper, too.
In addition to the fact that the deaths and other adverse events reported to the Dutch system are not confirmed to be caused by the vaccines, the authors arbitrarily chose to use that system to look at the case reports submitted per 100,000 vaccinations. But that system’s volume is an outlier, relative to the rest of Europe.
""They have a median of 127 per 100k, ranging from 15 to 701, with Netherlands’ 701 being an extreme outlier,"" Jeffrey Morris, director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email. ""They give some unconvincing rationale why they think using the 701 to represent the truth is the best idea, thus strongly skewing the adverse event rate of vaccines by a factor of almost 6 relative to using the median for all of Europe.""

The paper also uses a concept known as the number needed to vaccinate, or NNTV, to estimate how many doses would need to be administered in order to avert one COVID-19 case or death. For deaths, it concludes that ""the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.""
But using that kind of measure — also referred to as the number needed to treat, or NNT — is problematic for several reasons, Morris said, especially for something where the risk is spread over a long period of time.
""The key factor here is that NNT depends directly on the time frame, and when you compute it using data from a short term study, it severely [underestimates] the benefit when the risk is spread over a longer time frame,"" he said.
The authors used data from an Israeli study that followed up with participants who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for an average of 15 days.
Morris said the short time frame for computing vaccine benefit is ""especially misleading"" since the reported adverse events (which again, aren’t confirmed to be due to the vaccine) are typically occurring within that short time frame — ""but only a small fraction of the beneficial effects of the vaccine, preventing cases for the next year or two or longer, are captured.""
Also, the measure is influenced by other factors — such as lockdowns, social distancing and masking.
And when many people are vaccinated, the probability of infection and death goes down — therefore making the number needed to vaccinate higher (and the vaccine benefit appear smaller).
""In short, the NNT is an extremely flawed measure even if they had good data for estimating the risk of infection, hospitalization and death for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and interpreted the data properly (which of course they did not),"" Morris said.

		Quick Take
Amid a surge in Florida’s COVID-19 cases, a Facebook meme dated June 24 falsely claims the state’s surgeon general recommended that people stop wearing face masks. The surgeon general actually issued an advisory two days earlier saying everyone in Florida ""should wear face coverings in any setting where social distancing is not possible.""

Full Story 
Florida is among several states where COVID-19 cases surged in late June. The state surpassed its previous daily record for new coronavirus cases, reporting 9,585 infections on June 27. Florida has recorded a total of 146,341 cases, including 3,447 deaths, as of June 29.
In response, some Florida officials have slowed — or reversed — the lifting of restrictions implemented to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the illness. On June 26, state officials prohibited the sale of alcohol in bars. Miami-Dade and Broward counties have decided to close their beaches for the Fourth of July weekend.
With a broader stroke, Florida’s surgeon general, Dr. Scott Rivkees, issued a public health advisory on June 22 urging Floridians to ""wear face coverings in any setting where social distancing is not possible.""
But two days later, a meme on Facebook falsely claimed the opposite, saying: ""The Florida Surgeon General has issued a Public Health Advisory. Everyone should STOP wearing masks as they have now been found to be harmful to your health."" 
The inaccurate meme labels itself as an ""EMERGENCY ALERT.""
Since the pandemic first spread to Florida, the state government has been cautious in implementing restrictions on residents and businesses. Florida announced its first cases of COVID-19 in early March. By the end of March, Florida had the sixth most coronavirus cases in the U.S. 
But while 30 state governors issued statewide lockdowns that month, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis had only issued a ""safer-at-home"" order in four counties in southern Florida by the end of March. 
On March 31, 13 members of Congress sent DeSantis a letter asking that he issue a statewide lockdown order. He did so on April 1. 
In early May, Florida entered the first phase of DeSantis’ reopening plan, with hospitals being allowed to accommodate non-essential procedures and restaurants and stores allowed to reopen with limited indoor capacities under social distancing guidelines. In early June, DeSantis began the second phase of the plan, allowing movie theaters, bars and event spaces to open, again with limited indoor capacities. He has said that the state is not ready for the third phase of the reopening plan. 
Throughout June, while Florida has experienced a rise in COVID-19 cases, DeSantis has attributed the surge to increased testing. But, as we have written, the rise in cases is not all attributable to more tests. 
In Florida, the seven-day average for the test positivity rate, as analyzed by Johns Hopkins University, is now 15.5% — three times the recommended target of 5%, which the state had been hitting for nearly all of May.
While Florida’s surgeon general recommends face mask usage, neither he nor DeSantis have said that it should be mandated by the state.

      CDC Did Not ‘Admit Only 6%’ of Recorded Deaths from COVID-19

		The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t drastically reduced the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, but posts making that bogus claim have been circulating widely — with the help of President Donald Trump, who retweeted one such claim on Aug. 30.
Twitter has since removed the original tweet, which came from an account dedicated to the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon. But the claim is still readily available on all the major social media platforms. In fact, the same QAnon account that posted the now-deleted tweet includes a screenshot version featuring the president’s retweet.
The post Trump highlighted said: ""This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid. That’s 9,210 deaths. The other 94% had 2 to 3 other serious illnesses and the overwhelming majority were of very advanced age.""
But that’s not what the CDC information says.
In weekly updates provided on the CDC’s website, the agency includes information on additional conditions present in patients who died with COVID-19. These other illnesses or conditions found to be present in a patient are called comorbidities. The agency also includes a chart detailing the number of patients with each additional condition.
For the week referenced in the claim, the CDC explained that the chart ""shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.""
That means that 6% of those who died with COVID-19 through Aug. 15 didn’t have any other reported conditions.
It does not mean that the CDC has ""quietly updated"" the number of deaths associated with COVID-19 to a fraction of what had been reported. It’s also not new information; the agency has been providing the same information since May.
Asked about Trump’s tweet during a press briefing on Aug. 31, though, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that ""he was highlighting new CDC information that came out that was worth noting.""
At that time, the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. had passed 183,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, and the total number of cases across the country had passed 6 million.
McEnany said that the president was not trying to downplay the death toll.
The following morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, clarified what the CDC data mean.
He noted that the 6% figure includes cases where COVID-19 was listed as the only cause of death. ""That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn’t die of Covid-19. They did,"" Fauci said on ABC’s ""Good Morning America.""
""So the numbers you’ve been hearing — the 180,000-plus deaths — are real deaths from Covid-19. Let [there] not be any confusion about that,"" Fauci said.
Other versions of the claim are misleading, rather than being strictly false. One example is a headline on the conservative outlet Gateway Pundit, which announced: ""This Week CDC Quietly Updated COVID-19 Numbers – Only 9,210 Americans Died From COVID-19 Alone – Rest Had Different Other Serious Illnesses.""
The president retweeted a link to that, too, and the phrase ""only 6%"" trended on Twitter.
Several media outlets flipped the percentage and reported that 94% of COVID-19 deaths had ""underlying medical conditions.""
But the data on which all of this is based come from death certificates, which list any causes or conditions that contributed to a person’s death. In the case of COVID-19, the disease often causes other serious conditions, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Those two conditions are among the ailments with the highest counts in the CDC’s comorbidity chart. Some long-term conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19, such as diabetes or hypertension, were also listed.
The underlying cause of death, however, is the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person’s death. In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, that disease is listed as the underlying cause of death, Jeff Lancashire, spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told FactCheck.org in an email.
As the epidemiologist and science writer Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz explained in a recent post, ""it’s pretty rare that someone wouldn’t have at least one issue caused by coronavirus prior to their death, and all it means is that in 94% of cases people who had COVID-19 also developed other issues, or had other problems at the same time.""
Meyerowitz-Katz notes that influenza and pneumonia are listed as the most common concurrent diseases, which isn’t surprising. ""Similarly,"" he writes, ""respiratory failure, something that the coronavirus directly causes, is listed here as a ‘comorbidity’ that 55,000 people had.""
So, it’s misleading to say that 94% of those who died with COVID-19 also had other ailments without explaining that the disease causes other serious illnesses. And it’s wrong to claim that only 6% of the recorded COVID-19 deaths were caused by the disease.
Update, Sept. 2: In an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham that aired Sept. 1, Trump made this false claim himself, saying, ""I saw a statistic come out the other day, talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interest[ing], that they died for — from other reasons.""
Ingraham corrected him, explaining that those who die from COVID-19 often have other conditions, but COVID-19 ""might ultimately have been the key morbidity.""
""But it’s an interesting statistic,"" Trump responded.

		After months of campaigning, President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made their final pitches to voters at campaign rallies in key swing states and on TV airwaves.
Here we fact-check claims the candidates made in rallies on Nov. 1 and 2, and in a few of the TV ads they are airing in the waning hours before Election Day.
We reviewed Trump’s rallies in Michigan, North Carolina, Iowa and Florida and Biden’s rallies and remarks in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Trump Campaign TV Ads
The Trump campaign has spent $10.5 million on TV and digital ads in the final week of the campaign, according to data collected by Advertising Analytics. The campaign is still spending heavily on misleading ads attacking Biden on taxes, health care and protests for racial justice.
Taxes. Since Oct. 29, the campaign has spent nearly $1 million on an ad that shows Biden, in February, saying, ""if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut."" Then it shows Biden, in October, saying, ""And here’s how it works. I’m going to raise taxes."" But in neither case was he talking about raising taxes for everyone.
Biden has pledged not to directly raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. The most recent estimate by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center on Oct. 15 calculates that the net result of all of Biden’s tax proposals in 2022 would be, on average, a tax cut for the bottom 80% of households, with the top one-tenth of 1% of earners bearing 70% of Biden’s proposed tax increases.
Health insurance. In recent days, more than $4 million has been spent on a Republican National Committee/Trump ad that claims ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ government-run health care plan"" could ""give benefits to illegal immigrants."" But Biden doesn’t support the Medicare for All plan proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden, in addition to private health insurance, has proposed offering a Medicare-style public option only as a choice. The ad cites a conservative think tank’s argument that a public option would lead to a government health care system, but that’s not what Biden has proposed. He has also said immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be able to buy health insurance plans, not get them for free.
Violent protests. In addition, the Trump campaign has spent more than $400,000 to run an ad that says, ""While America’s cities burned, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris fan the flames, refusing to strongly condemn violence, supporting bail funds that helped let rioters, looters and dangerous criminals out of jail.""
But Biden and Harris both have condemned violent protests, riots and looting. As early as late May, for example, Biden issued a widely reported statement saying: ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.""
And, to be clear, in June, Harris asked the public to contribute to the Minnesota Freedom Fund to specifically ""help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota."" She did not mention ""rioters, looters and dangerous criminals"" — some of whom were also aided by the nonprofit.
Biden Campaign TV Ads
The Biden campaign has spent nearly $50 million on TV and digital ads in the final week of the campaign, according to data collected by Advertising Analytics. But there are not a lot of facts to check in Biden’s ads.
The campaign of the Democratic presidential nominee is running largely positive ads about Biden’s character and ads designed to increase voter turnout. There have been numerous ads telling voters how to cast ballots in key swing states, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.
The issues covered in the Biden campaign ads include COVID-19, health insurance, the economy, Social Security, taxes and racial injustice.
One ad that has been in heavy rotation leaves the false impression that Trump has a plan to ""wipe out Social Security in just three years."" The campaign has spent $7.1 million on the ad since Sept. 25, including nearly $1.9 million in the last seven days.
""The Social Security Administration just released a report saying that if a plan like the one Trump is proposing goes into effect, the Social Security trust fund will be, and I quote, ‘permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023,’"" Biden says in the ad, which also displays text on the screen that says, ""Trump’s Plan would wipe out Social Security in just three years.""
But Trump has no such plan, as we have written before — including elsewhere in this article.
The campaign also has spent more than $8 million in the last month on a TV ad called ""Gets It Done"" that among other things says Biden’s economic plan ""raises wages by as much as $15,000 a year."" It’s not clear in the ad, but that pay raise applies to a subset of workers. And it would not reach that level for years even for them.
The campaign tells us Biden’s support for a $15 minimum wage would translate into a $15,000 a year increase for full-time employees working 40 hours per week at the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour.
But there are caveats to that $15,000 pay raise. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia currently have higher minimum wage rates than the federal rate, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Also, Biden hasn’t provided details on his plan, but the Democratic-controlled House passed a bill last year that would phase in the increase over six years. That could mean Biden’s $15 minimum would not take effect until 2027.
Trump Campaign Rally Claims
Auto plants. Trump made several false claims about how the auto industry in Michigan fared both before and after he took office. The fact is, Michigan has lost motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs under Trump, even before the coronavirus pandemic caused economic shutdowns. Those jobs declined by 2,400 during Trump’s time in office through February, and they’ve dropped by another 15,800 since.
General Motors built a light vehicle assembly plant in Lansing Delta Township, completed in 2006, the company’s ""newest plant"" in the country, it says, and the most recent light vehicle assembly plant built in the state prior to 2017, as we’ve written. But in a Nov. 1 rally, Trump falsely told Michiganders that ""no new [auto] plants had been built in Michigan in decades and decades before I got here.""
He wrongly claimed that ""we brought back your car industry. Your car industry was finished. You would’ve had nothing left."" Automaker investments in the state were higher during the last three years under the Obama administration than they have been under Trump, as we’ve explained. The value of investments dropped 29% under Trump, according to data provided by the independent Center for Automotive Research.
Also, on a yearly basis, both domestic production and light weight vehicle sales have been lower under Trump’s presidency than they were in 2016, the year before he took office.
Trump also repeated a tale involving former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and an announcement of ""five companies moving to Michigan from Japan."" As we’ve written, there have been five new investments by Japanese automakers in Michigan, but only one of them is a manufacturing facility, announced just 10 days after Trump took office. Honda and GM announced the joint venture to produce hydrogen fuel cell systems.
Ethanol. Campaigning in Dubuque, Iowa, Trump falsely claimed that ""if Biden gets in you can forget about ethanol, you can forget about everything. You would have that terminated."" Biden’s campaign website states: ""From day one, President Biden will use every tool at his disposal, including the federal fleet and the federal government’s purchasing power, to promote and advance renewable energy, ethanol, and other biofuels."" The Washington Post noted that Biden made the promise to promote ethanol over the objections of some environmentalists.
COVID-19 vaccine. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, the day before the election, the president exaggerated the timeline for a coronavirus vaccine. ""We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks,"" Trump said. ""It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state.""
It’s not clear when a COVID-19 vaccine will be ready, assuming one or more candidates are found to be safe and effective in phase 3 clinical trials. But the most optimistic estimates do not include distributing a vaccine in a few weeks — and certainly not at a scale that would end the pandemic.
The leading U.S. candidate in terms of speed is Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine. The company, however, has said that because the Food and Drug Administration is seeking to have two months of safety data on at least half of the trial participants, it doesn’t plan to even submit its application for an emergency use authorization to the agency until the third week of November.
The FDA would then have to review the application and make a decision before distribution could begin. That also assumes the results are positive, which is not guaranteed.
Even if the Pfizer vaccine receives authorization before December, it would not mean a speedy end to the pandemic. Only a limited number of doses will be available to start — prioritized for those at highest risk — and it is likely to take well into 2021 for most Americans to be vaccinated.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned on Oct. 27 that ""it will be easily by the end of 2021, and perhaps even into the next year, before we start having some semblances of normality."" 
Trump, who once said he thought a vaccine was probable in October and has repeatedly claimed a vaccine is coming to the masses soon, also misleads by saying that the shots will ""quickly eradicate the virus."" As we’ve explained, even with a vaccine, the coronavirus will not necessarily disappear completely, as it is likely to stick around, cropping up seasonally in a more mild form. 
The president is also wrong that Biden ""is promising to delay the vaccine."" Biden has expressed concerns about the vaccine approval process being transparent, but has said he would listen to scientists and that he wants a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible. ""If I could get a vaccine tomorrow, I’d do it,"" he said in September. ""If it cost me the election I’d do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now.""
Looting. Trump falsely claimed that Biden ""doesn’t even want to condemn"" ""rioters, looters, arsonists"" following the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. in Philadelphia on Oct. 26. In fact, the day after the shooting, Biden put out a statement in which he condemned violent responses. ""No amount of anger at the very real injustices in our society excuses violence,"" Biden stated. ""Attacking police officers and vandalizing small businesses, which are already struggling during a pandemic, does not bend the moral arc of the universe closer to justice. It hurts our fellow citizens. Looting is not a protest, it is a crime. It draws attention away from the real tragedy of a life cut short.""
Biden made similar comments after he voted in Wilmington on Oct. 28, when a reporter asked him about the situation in Philadelphia. Biden responded, ""What I say is that there is no excuse whatsoever for the looting and the violence, none whatsoever. I think to be able to protest is totally legitimate, totally reasonable. But I think that the looting is just, as the victim’s father said, ‘Do not do this. It’s not what my son … You’re not helping, you’re hurting. You’re not helping my son.’""
‘Rounding the turn.’ In speeches in Michigan and North Carolina, the president repeated the false notion that the U.S. is ""rounding the turn"" on the COVID-19 pandemic. On the contrary, data from the COVID Tracking Project show that new daily cases are at a record high, and hospitalizations and deaths are on the upswing. Public health officials also dispute Trump’s assessment, with the country’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, telling the Washington Post on Oct. 30 that America ""could not possibly be positioned more poorly"" as temperatures drop and more people spend time together indoors.
Fauci. As the crowd in Opa-locka, Florida, chanted, ""Fire Fauci!"" — referring to a lead member of the Trump administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force who has criticized the president’s mixed messages on wearing masks — Trump said that might happen ""a little bit after the election."" Trump then misleadingly claimed Fauci has ""been wrong on a lot,"" noting that Fauci said, ""Do not, under any circumstances, wear a mask.""
As we have reported, in the early months of 2020, Fauci did tell the general public not to wear face masks because he was concerned it could lead to a shortage of masks for health care workers. However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, Fauci and other White House health officials reversed course in early April and began recommending people wear masks in public when socially distancing is difficult. ""Anybody who has been listening to me over the last several months knows that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,"" Fauci said in an interview on Sept. 30.
Man of the year. Trump repeated an old chestnut: that he ""got Man of the Year in Michigan, 12 years ago."" There’s no evidence for that. As we’ve written, it appears Trump is referring to a 2013 dinner hosted by a county Republican Party organization, which presented him with token gifts, not an award. 
Economy. Trump falsely claimed that prior to the pandemic the U.S. ""had the greatest economy in the history of the world."" The economy has grown faster under other presidents — and so have jobs.
He also claimed that after what he called ""the plague,"" the economy has rebounded: ""So, we got it going,"" he said in Michigan, pointing to a record annual gross domestic product growth rate of 33.1% in the third quarter. In Iowa, he called it ""a super V"" recovery and claimed, ""We’re all set."" But as we’ve explained, the GDP figures show an economy still far from fully recovered.
Private insurance. The president falsely claimed in Iowa that the Biden ticket ""will eliminate the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans."" Biden doesn’t support such a plan. Instead, he has proposed building on the Affordable Care Act by increasing subsidies to buy private insurance and adding a Medicare-like public option as a choice.
Immigrants. Biden hasn’t ""pledged … free health care for illegal aliens,"" no matter how many times Trump says it. Biden has said those who are now in the country illegally should be able to buy insurance, without any subsidies — not get it for ""free"" — on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, as we’ve written before. 
2 million ‘saved’ lives. As he has before, Trump referenced an Imperial College London report to claim that he saved 2 million American lives from the coronavirus. ""Remember the model? It said 2.2 million people would die,"" Trump said in North Carolina. ""Well, we saved 2 million people by acting quickly."" He repeated the claim in Iowa. That distorts what the March report said. The projection of 2.2 million American deaths was not meant to be a realistic estimate of what the losses would be, but rather a kind of worst case scenario in which people did not change their behaviors and no mitigation measures whatsoever were taken.
Fracking. Trump suggested Biden would eliminate fracking, saying in Michigan: ""’Will not frack!’ You know, he said that for a year, and then when he came to Pennsylvania, goes like, ‘Oh yeah, I guess it’s okay.’ No, no, there won’t be energy."" Biden’s plan calls for prohibiting permits for new oil and gas drilling on federal land and waters. That would allow fracking to continue under existing permits and in nonfederal areas — where the vast majority of U.S. oil and natural gas is produced, as we’ve said.
Suburbs. In both Michigan and Iowa, Trump claimed he ""got rid of the regulation that will ruin the suburbs,"" or ""destroy"" them. he’s referring to ending a Department of Housing and Urban Development 2015 rule on fair housing. But experts told us the rule didn’t mandate low-income housing or rezoning, as Trump previously has claimed or suggested. The rule changed the way jurisdictions that receive HUD funding develop and report plans to address fair housing issues in their communities.
Guns. Trump falsely told North Carolinians and Floridians that Biden and Harris ""want to take away your guns"" or ""confiscate your guns."" Not so. Biden called for a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines for ammunition. He said he wouldn’t confiscate the affected assault weapons that had already been purchased legally.
China tariffs. Trump repeated false claims about tariffs he placed on goods imported from China, telling North Carolinians ""we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars a year first time ever with China; we never took in 25 cents."" The U.S. has collected billions in customs duties on Chinese imports for years. The amount did increase greatly under Trump’s trade war. 
In Iowa, the president boasted of giving $28 billion to farmers hurt by that trade war, claiming that China ""paid for it, you didn’t pay."" As we’ve explained, the tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, and to some extent by U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. A Government Accountability Office report put the 2018/2019 total paid to farmers because of trade disruptions at $23.1 billion.
COVID-19 lockdowns. Trump incorrectly said at multiple rallies that certain Democratic states were still closed due to the pandemic and suggested — without evidence — that states would announce reopenings the day after the election. He also falsely claimed that Biden is ""all about lockdowns.""
""And by the way, tell your governor to open up North Carolina,"" Trump said in Hickory, North Carolina. ""It’s time. It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. They’ll probably announce it on November 4th."" 
North Carolina is not under a lockdown. Given concerning indicators that the coronavirus was picking up steam, Gov. Roy Cooper paused reopening on Oct. 21. The pause left the state in phase 3 for three more weeks rather than moving to phase 4 — and allows many businesses, including movie theaters, amusement parks and bars, to operate, but with capacity limits in place.
""The Biden Plan is to imprison you in your home,"" Trump similarly said to supporters in Macomb County, Michigan, adding, ""that’s what you’re going through right now with this governor.""
That’s a gross exaggeration of the situation in the Wolverine state, which lifted its stay-at-home order on June 1 and is, like most states, in the process of reopening. Following a rise in coronavirus cases, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer moved a portion of the state back from phase 5 to phase 4 on Oct. 29, which imposes more restrictions, such as capacity limits in restaurants, but is hardly equivalent to home imprisonment.
Trump also falsely said Pennsylvania was ""all locked down"" — even though the state has been largely open since July 3.
As we’ve written, Biden said in an ABC News interview that he would follow scientists’ advice if they recommended shutting down again, but later clarified that he does not think such action will be necessary.

Puerto Rico pharma. As he has before, Trump exaggerated Biden’s role in the loss of pharmaceutical jobs in Puerto Rico. Trump said, ""And we’re returning the pharmaceutical industry back to Puerto Rico. You know, Biden is the one that took it out.""
In 1996, Biden, then a senator, joined all of the Democrats who voted and a majority of Republicans, who controlled the Senate at the time, in approving a wide-ranging bill focused largely on small businesses. As we have written, it is true that the legislation, in an effort to limit ""corporate welfare,"" phased out a tax exemption for companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. Loss of the exemption did impel many pharmaceutical companies to move their operations off of the island. But the island’s drug manufacturing industry has not been shut down. According to the Food and Drug Administration, in 2016 about 30% of Puerto Rico’s gross domestic product consisted of drug and medical device manufacturing, and 8% of U.S. pharmaceutical expenditures were for products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The island is home to 49 pharmaceutical plants, according to the Puerto Rican government. Biden was hardly ""the one that took it out."" And Trump did not focus on the issue until late in his term as the election approached.

‘Super predators.’ Trump wrongly said in Michigan that Biden ""openly called young black men ‘super predators.’"" He repeated the claim in North Carolina. There is no record of the former vice president using the term, which Hillary Clinton uttered in 1996 about some ""gangs of kids"" in support of the 1994 crime bill.
Travel restrictions. In two North Carolina rallies, the president repeated his claim that Biden was against Trump’s travel restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus, saying in Fayetteville that Biden is ""on record all over the place, knocking me two and a half months later for closing too soon and closing it all. He said, ‘Don’t close. He’s xenophobic.’"" There is no record of Biden saying, ""Don’t close."" In fact, Biden’s campaign said on April 3 that the former vice president supported the travel restrictions. Biden did use the word ""xenophobic"" to describe Trump on the day the travel restrictions from China were announced, but it’s not clear whether he was alluding to the restrictions. Biden’s campaign has said the ""reference to xenophobia"" wasn’t about the travel restrictions but rather ""Trump’s long record of scapegoating others.""
ISIS. In Florida, Trump, as he often does, embellished his administration’s record on dealing with the Islamic State, or ISIS, and falsely portrayed the performance of the Obama administration. Trump said, ""We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and it was a mess. Let me tell you, when I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place. It’s gone, 100%."" As we have written, according to figures provided by Trump’s own administration, about half of the territory held by ISIS had been regained under President Barack Obama.
Border security. The president wrongly said in North Carolina that Biden is ""talking about taking down the wall. Can you believe? ‘Let’s take down the wall and let everybody pour into our country.’ He wants to take down."" Biden hasn’t said that. He has said he would end funding for Trump’s project, but hasn’t said he would tear down what has been built. ""I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry — that’s where all the bad stuff is happening,"" Biden said in an interview on Aug. 5.
Biden Campaign Rally Claims
Meadows on the pandemic. At a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, Biden mischaracterized what White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said about the Trump administration and COVID-19. Biden said, ""His chief of staff last week said, ‘We’re going to do nothing about the virus. It’s here.’"" But Meadows didn’t say the administration was going to ""do nothing."" He told CNN’s Jake Tapper: ""We are not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation areas.""
Social Security. Biden said of Trump, ""His actuary at Social Security, fulltime at the Social Security Administration, says if Donald Trump’s plan, were he to be reelected, gets put in place, it will bankrupt Social Security by 2023."" But that is not the case. As we have written, the actuary analyzed ""hypothetical legislation"" that would eliminate the payroll tax that funds Social Security — not a proposal from Trump. The president has said he won’t cut benefits.
It’s true that Trump has said on multiple occasions that, if reelected, he would look at ""ending"" or ""terminating the payroll tax."" But White House and Trump campaign officials have said the president actually wants to forgive a four-month payroll tax holiday he authorized in August via executive action. Trump himself has said: ""[W]hen I win the election, I’m going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape or form hurting Social Security. That money is going to come from the general fund.""
Trump’s Muslim ‘ban.’ At a campaign event in Philadelphia, Biden falsely stated that Trump ""put a ban on all Muslims coming to the United States."" As we have written, even Trump’s original executive order, which applied to seven countries with heavily Muslim populations, would have affected about 12% of the world’s Muslim population, according to the Pew Research Center. A subsequent ban applied to two fewer countries. However, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump did advocate a ""total and complete shutdown"" of Muslims entering the United States ""until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.""
Preexisting conditions. Biden again said that if the Affordable Care Act were nullified by the courts — an action Trump supports — ""100 million Americans will lose their protections for preexisting conditions including 5 million of you here in Pennsylvania."" It’s true that all Americans would lose the ACA’s expanded protections, which prohibit insurers in all markets from denying coverage or charging more based on health status. The 100 million figure is an estimate of how many Americans not on Medicare or Medicaid have preexisting conditions. But how those individuals would be affected by an ACA repeal depends on where they get insurance. 
Only those seeking coverage on the individual or nongroup market would immediately be at risk of being denied insurance. Even without the ACA, employer plans couldn’t deny issuing a policy — and could only decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.

      FactChecking Trump’s ‘Fox News Sunday’ Interview

		President Donald Trump’s extraordinary interview with ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace, who frequently fact-checked the president in real time, contained a long list of false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims:

The president claimed other countries, later mentioning Europe, are only testing for COVID-19 if someone is ""really sick"" and that the ""massive"" testing in the U.S. ""skews the numbers."" But testing data show many countries, including in Europe, have conducted more tests per confirmed case than the U.S.
Trump falsely claimed that there’s ""no reason"" — ""[e]xcept for Nov. 3rd"" — for California to pull back on reopening its economy. Multiple states, including California, have concerning trends that public health experts — including those on the White House’s coronavirus task force — say warrant business closures and other precautions.
Trump claimed he ""forced"" Seattle officials to finally end protests near a police precinct because ""they heard"" that ""we were going in that following day."" Seattle’s mayor said her decision had nothing to do with Trump, who she said never notified her of a plan to send in federal forces.
Trump falsely claimed credit for ""the biggest pay raises in the history of our military."" The largest increase in basic military pay under Trump was 3.1%. It was higher than that seven times in the last 19 years — including a high of 5% in 2002.

In the interview, which took place on the patio outside the Oval Office, the president also repeated numerous bogus talking points, including about presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s immigration proposals, Dr. Anthony Fauci’s alleged ""mistakes"" and the U.S. economy.
The president falsely claimed once again that the U.S. has ""one of the lowest mortality rates"" for COVID-19 of any country, and distorted the facts about the harm caused by the coronavirus.
Testing Per Case Higher in Many Other Countries
Trump claimed that other countries — later pointing to Europe — are only testing for COVID-19 if someone is ""really sick,"" saying the ""massive"" testing in the U.S. ""really skews the numbers.""
But that’s not what testing data indicate. Many countries, including in Europe, have conducted more tests per confirmed case of COVID-19 than the U.S.
If other countries have tested more people than have actually had the disease, compared with the U.S., that suggests those countries couldn’t have been only testing the ""really sick.""
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told us in an email that ""tests per confirmed case provides an indication of how aggressively a country is testing. And many countries are at much higher rates than the US.""
Trump’s claim is a new twist on his repeated false assertion that increased testing is the only reason some states in the U.S. have seen an uptick in new COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.
The president first told Wallace this about other countries’ testing programs:
Trump, July 17: You look at other countries; they don’t even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they’re sick, they’re really sick, they test them then, or they’ll test them in a doctor’s office. But they don’t go around, have massive areas of testing and we do. And I’m glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.
Later in the interview, he singled out Europe and dismissed the possibility that the European Union doesn’t have as bad of an outbreak as the U.S. does now.
Trump: Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they’re having surges.
Wallace: I can tell you cases are 6,000 in the whole European Union.
Trump: They don’t test. They don’t test like we do.
Wallace: Is it possible that they don’t have the virus as badly as we do?
Trump: It’s possible that they don’t test, that’s what’s possible.
According to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data, several European countries’ testing policies are open testing for anyone, including those without any symptoms; those countries include Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Greece and Iceland. That’s the current policy in the United States.
Many other countries in Europe, including Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom, test ""anyone with symptoms."" Only a handful of countries have more restrictive testing policies for those with symptoms and other criteria, such as having been admitted to the hospital or in contact with someone who has COVID-19. Those countries include Bulgaria, Hungary, Kosovo, Serbia and Albania.
Experts have told us before that looking at the test positivity rate — the percentage of conducted tests that are positive — shows whether a country is doing enough testing. By that measure, nearly all European countries, as well as many other countries around the globe, are doing better than the United States.
""The way we can tell whether a country is only testing people who are sick enough to show up at a hospital is to look at their test positivity,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us in an email. ""When positivity is high, it means a country is likely only testing the sickest of the sick. But if positivity is lower, then the country is likely casting a wide net to look for infections and count them as cases.""
Nuzzo cited New York state as an example. In the spring, when the state was only able to test those sick enough to be hospitalized, the positivity rate was as high as 50.7%. ""Now that it has expanded testing, [its] positivity has fallen quite dramatically and is now less than 2%,"" she said.
Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the U.S. has an average daily positivity rate of 6.45%. Several countries, including Germany, Spain, Italy, Iceland, Greece and Norway, have lower rates. Among European countries, only France and Sweden have higher rates.
Nuzzo said it’s possible some countries have restricted testing only to the hospitalized, but ""the data from many countries in Europe and elsewhere suggest they are doing a better job of finding infections than the US.""
Another way of looking at positivity is the number of tests per confirmed case. The U.S. has conducted 12.4 or 13.2 tests per confirmed case, depending on the data source used, but European countries, and others across the globe, have conducted more tests per case, according to Our World in Data. 
For example, the United Kingdom and Italy — two countries that have faced sizable outbreaks of COVID-19 — have conducted 27.4 and 25.6 tests per case, respectively. (Only France and Sweden, among European countries, rank lower than the U.S., but the available information for those two countries dates back to early July and May. We don’t know whether that’s still the case.)
We can also look at tests per confirmed case over time through the seven-day rolling average. By that measure, the U.S. is currently conducting fewer tests per confirmed case than the 30-some European countries for which Our World in Data has figures.
The difference in the trajectory of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. compared with European countries is striking.

In a July 20 Wall Street Journal article, Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute said the ""fundamental difference"" was that ""Europe has taken the virus seriously, and America largely has not."" Jha told the newspaper: ""We didn’t build testing and tracing programs, and in parts of the country we didn’t even bring cases down. We have done things half way.""
California’s Pullback on Reopening
In discussing the economy and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump claimed that states were backpedaling on reopening ""on purpose,"" and singled out California as having ""no reason"" to do so other than politics.
Wallace: With states now rolling back some of the reopening and…
Trump: On purpose.
Wallace: Well, there are a lot of Republican …
Trump: On purpose.
Wallace: Well, there are a lot of Republican states, like Texas …
Trump: There is no reason …
Wallace: And here’s …
Trump: They’ll be open very soon.
Wallace: Let me just ask my question.
Trump: There’s no reason for California to be doing what they’re doing.
Wallace: Alright.
Trump: Except for Nov. 3rd.
There is no evidence that California or other states are halting or reversing their reopenings for political reasons. 
On the contrary, multiple states have concerning trends, such as increases in COVID-19 cases and test positivity, that public health experts — including those on the White House’s coronavirus task force — say warrant business closures and other precautions.
On July 13, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he was shutting down indoor operations of bars, restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, card rooms, and zoos and museums across the state. Counties failing to meet certain metrics would additionally have to close fitness centers, places of worship, offices for non-critical sectors, hair salons, barbershops and indoor malls.
In a press conference, Newsom said the seven-day rolling average for new coronavirus cases was on the rise, and that over the past two weeks, hospitalizations had increased 28%, ICU admissions had increased 20%, and the two-week average test positivity rate had also gone up 21%, to 7.4%.
""It’s a consequence of [an] increase in positivity rate, increase in hospitalizations, in ICUs,"" Newsom said of the decision to pullback on reopening, adding that it was not an ""on and off switch,"" but rather a dimmer switch intended to be responsive to changing conditions.
Newsom is not the only person to be worried about the coronavirus trends in his state. In a July 8 task force briefing, Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx specifically noted the ""increase in the number of test positives and rapid increase in cases"" in California and referenced state-level governmental action.
""I think the work that these governors have done to — and ask the American people is it’s stop going to bars, to close the bars, to move to outdoor dining, to decrease indoor — any kind of indoor gatherings again,"" she said.
Birx identified Texas, Arizona, Florida and California as four of the most concerning states, and alluded to a task force report labeling ""red zone"" localities. 
""To all of the Americans out there that are in these four states and the states that have — in the report, were in the red zone — because there’s a series of other states that we have in that zone,"" she said, ""is really asking the American people in those counties and in those states — in those states to not only use the face coverings — not going to bars, not going to indoor dining — but really not gathering in homes either and decreasing those gatherings back down to our phase one recommendation, which was 10 or less.""
The Center for Public Integrity obtained a July 14 edition of the report, which lists 18 states as being in the ""red zone"" for new COVID-19 cases, or more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the last week. Eleven states were in the ""red zone"" for test positivity, with figures above 10%.
According to the report, California was in the red for new cases and the yellow for test positivity, with 9.3% of tests coming back positive.
Under the policy recommendations for California’s 14 red counties, the task force report suggested that public officials ""[c]lose bars and gyms, and create outdoor dining opportunities with pedestrian areas"" and ""[l]imit social gatherings to 10 people or fewer.""
For California’s 17 yellow counties, the report recommended that officials ""[l]imit gyms to 25% occupancy and close bars until percent positive rates are under 3%; create outdoor dining opportunities with pedestrian areas"" and """"[l]imit social gatherings to 25 people or fewer.""
Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus task force member and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a June 24 interview with the Sacramento Press Club that it might be necessary to pause or back down from some reopening if trends started to move in the wrong direction.
Praising Newsom for having a ""really good sense of [what] to do,"" Fauci explained that the options were not limited to all or none.
""You don’t really need to go back to lockdown,"" he said. ""You need to pause and say, wait a minute, we [started] opening, and things aren’t going right. What do we need to do to correct that? Now, you may need to stay where you are and impose a few more restrictions. Or, maybe back up a little. But again, just like you don’t want to open in an all or none, you don’t want to start locking down completely.""
Newsom’s plan is not a complete lockdown, and allows many businesses to continue to operate outside.
There may be differing opinions on the degree and type of restrictions to put in place, but California’s limitations are predicated on specific metrics and are an effort to avoid further transmission of the coronavirus.
Seattle Protests
Trump said Seattle officials finally acted to clear a protest zone near a police precinct in the city because he was sending in federal forces to do so.
Trump: We have forced them in Seattle to end the CHOP [Capitol Hill Organized Protest] because, you know, we were going in that following day. You probably have heard it. We were getting ready to go in. We were all set, and when they heard that we were going they set their police force.
But Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan had already told the Washington Post that neither Trump, nor the White House, ever notified her, or her office, that federal troops were being sent in. In fact, Durkan said Trump had nothing to do with her decision to order Seattle police to end the protests that started in early June, not long after George Floyd died while in Minneapolis police custody.
Durkan denied having ever heard from Trump after he made a similar claim during a July 9 interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. In that interview, Trump told Hannity: ""We were going in, we were going in very soon. We let them know that. And they, all of a sudden, they didn’t want that, so they went in before we got there.""
Durkan and her office said no notice was given, according to a Washington Post story published a day after the Hannity interview.
""He never contacted me or my office to warn us,"" Durkan told the Post. ""We had no conversations whatsoever with the White House about anything related to the protests, Capitol Hill, or anything along these lines.""
On June 30, Durkan signed an executive order declaring the weekslong protests near the Seattle Police Department East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park area an ""unlawful assembly."" The order noted that the protests, which reportedly started out largely peaceful, had seen an increase in violence, including at least two fatal shootings.
On July 1, Seattle Police, who had previously ceded the area to protesters, began to enforce the mayor’s order to clear the area.
But, as the Washington Post reported on July 10: ""Durkan categorically rejected any suggestion that this was related to anything Trump or anyone around him communicated — privately or publicly. Her office told us that serious conversations between the mayor’s office and the police chief and community groups about ending the protests began around June 22.""
Trump did post tweets in mid-June threatening, or suggesting, federal action. But there is no indication that there was a plan to back up those threats.
""Congress should investigate whether there was actually a plan to send federal forces into an American city,"" the Washington Post quoted Durkan as saying.
Military Pay Raises
Trump falsely claimed that he ""got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military.""
In the current fiscal year, basic military pay increased by 3.1% — the largest during the Trump administration, according to a Department of Defense chart of annual pay raises since 2007. But that chart also shows there were larger pay hikes in 2008 (3.5%), 2009 (3.9%) and 2010 (3.4%).
The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service provides a table back to 2002 that shows there were larger increases in basic military pay in seven of the last 19 years, including 5% in 2002 and 4.1% in 2003.
The president’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 would raise basic military pay by 3%.
Also, as we have written on other occasions, military pay increases are determined by a statutory formula — unless overridden by the president and/or Congress.
""Under current law, the pay raise for service members is, by default, set to equal the percentage change in"" the employment cost index for private-sector workers’ wages and salaries, as the Congressional Budget Office explained in a 2018 report.
The president can ""specify an alternative pay adjustment that supersedes the automatic adjustment,"" and Congress can pass legislation that would ""supersede the automatic adjustment and/or any presidential adjustment,"" the CRS said in a May 6, 2019, report.
In his first budget, Trump proposed an increase of 2.1% — less than the 2.4% level set by the statutory formula for fiscal year 2018. Congress overrode the president’s proposal and provided the full military pay hike, according to the CRS report. Trump’s next three proposed budgets all followed the statutory formula, according to CRS and the White House fiscal 2021 budget proposal.  
Repeats
Fauci’s COVID-19 comments. Trump claimed Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, initially said of COVID-19: ""This will pass. Don’t worry about it. This will pass."" Trump added: ""He was wrong.""
But that’s not exactly what Fauci said.
In a Jan. 21 interview on Newsmax TV — which was highlighted in a memo the White House sent to some news outlets — Fauci said: ""Well, you know, obviously we need to take it seriously and do the kinds of things that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the Department of Homeland Security are doing. But this is not a major threat for the people in the U.S., and this is not something that the citizens of the U.S. right now should be worried about.""
Jan. 21 was the day the CDC announced the first U.S. case of the disease; relatively little was known about the virus at the time. Still, Fauci qualified his statement about the virus by saying there was no need to worry ""right now"" and ""we need to take it seriously.""
Also, in a Feb. 29 interview on NBC’s ""Today"" show, which was also cited in the White House memo, Fauci said that ""right now at this moment"" the risk was ""low"" and there was ""no need"" for people ""to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis."" But, he warned, ""When you start to see community spread"" — which is when the source of infection is unknown — ""this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread."" Fauci added that it could develop into a ""major outbreak,"" which is exactly what happened.
We wrote about Fauci’s ""Today"" show interview in late April.
Not the lowest COVID-19 mortality rate. As he has before, Trump falsely said the U.S has the ""number one low mortality rate,"" alternately saying when pressed, ""I heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world.""
As Wallace explained in the televised interview, the Our World in Data figures the president contends demonstrate the nation’s low COVID-19 case fatality rate do not show that, as many countries are left off of the graph Trump produced. And even on the president’s graph, which was dated July 17, three countries bested America: Brazil, South Korea and Iceland.
Data collected by Johns Hopkins University also do not show the U.S. with a particularly low mortality rate. Of the 20 most affected countries, the U.S. had the seventh highest observed case fatality ratio and the third highest number of deaths per capita at the time of the interview.
Misleads on COVID-19 severity. In response to Wallace noting that COVID-19 cases are up 194%, while testing is only up 37%, Trump downplayed the concern, instead focusing on COVID-19 not being deadly to most people.
""Many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test,"" he said. ""Many of them — don’t forget, I guess it’s like 99.7%, people are going to get better and in many cases they’re going to get better very quickly.""
It is true that younger people are less likely to die from COVID-19, although it still happens. But Trump overstates the percentage of people who survive the disease, and also misleadingly suggests, as he has before when he claimed 99% of coronavirus cases are ""totally harmless,"" that anyone who doesn’t die is left unscathed.
Scientists estimate that between 0.6% and 1% of all people who contract the coronavirus will die, with higher rates of death among the elderly and those with chronic conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, around 14% of cases are severe or require hospitalization, which means a sizable fraction of people are not simply those with ""sniffles.""
Furthermore, some reports suggest that a proportion of COVID-19 patients do not recover quickly. Anecdotally, numerous patients have reported months of lingering symptoms, even after ""mild"" COVID-19 infections. 
A July 9 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association also found that among 143 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Italy, only 18 (12.6%) were completely free of symptoms after an average of two months, while nearly a third had one or two symptoms and more than half had three or more. The most common symptoms were fatigue, difficulty breathing, and joint and chest pain; 44% of patients reported having a worse quality of life relative to before their infections.
Not the ""greatest economy."" Trump repeated one of his favorite false talking points: ""I built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world; not only of this country, anywhere in the world.""
Under Trump, the economy — as measured by the real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product — grew 2.3% last year, 2.9% in 2018 and 2.4% in 2017, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 2.9% 19 times, most recently in 2015. 
The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5% or more in seven straight years in the 1980s, including a high of 7.2% in 1984 under Reagan.
False claims on immigration. Trump also falsely said that the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations would ""abolish immigration detention"" and ""end prosecution of illegal border crossers."" Trump made similar misstatements in his remarks in the White House Rose Garden on July 14.
As we have written, the recommendations call for using detention as a ""last resort, not the default."" They also call for ending the use of for-profit detention centers. But they do not call for abolishing detention.
Similarly, the task force calls for reducing the number of prosecutions, not eliminating them. It calls for scrapping the Trump administration’s ""zero tolerance"" policy and focusing on prosecuting ""human traffickers, smugglers"" and other serious criminals.

		Quick Take
A viral claim on Facebook erroneously tells users that ""you will test positive"" for COVID-19 if ""you’ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years."" Vaccine and infectious disease experts told us that’s false, and the Food and Drug Administration says this hasn’t been observed in any authorized tests.


Full Story 
Social media users are spreading a baseless claim that the flu vaccine will lead to a false-positive test result for COVID-19.
""If you had a flu shot you will get likely get a false positive on a covid19 test,"" a Facebook post claims. Other posts assert: ""If you’ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years, you will test positive for the Wuhan strain of the Covid-19 flu.""
That’s false, according to experts in vaccines and infectious diseases — and the federal agency that authorizes such tests.
First of all, the reference to the ""Covid-19 flu"" is incorrect. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and coronaviruses are distinct from influenza viruses.
Flu shots are made using inactivated (not infectious) flu viruses or with a single gene from a flu virus in order to produce an immune response, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nasal spray flu vaccine is made with weakened flu viruses. It takes about two weeks after someone is vaccinated for the body to develop antibodies, which help protect against the flu.
Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview that the ""PCR tests"" — or polymerase chain reaction tests — used to identify active COVID-19 infections look for ""genetic fragments that are unique to this coronavirus.""
Offit said there’s no cross-reaction between influenza and the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, meaning traces of influenza wouldn’t result in a positive result for COVID-19. 
Likewise, Offit said, antibody tests — or serological tests, which look for antibodies in the blood to determine past infections — ""use proteins from this SARS-CoV-2, which do not cross-react with proteins from influenza.""
""They’re structurally unique,"" he said.
A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration further told us that all FDA-authorized tests for COVID-19 are specifically checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus or influenza antibodies and that, to date, there has been no such cross-reactivity observed for any of the tests. That check on tests diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 is important given overlapping symptoms between the two illnesses, the spokesperson added.
Offit emphasized that flu vaccines do not contain coronaviruses, as we’ve previously explained. That misconception about flu vaccines may contribute to the erroneous notion that the flu shot leads to false positive COVID-19 results. (There’s also no evidence that the flu shot increases risk of COVID-19, as the CDC notes and as we’ve previously reported.)
Most flu vaccines are manufactured using chicken eggs, but about 10% in the U.S. are cell-culture vaccines — which use Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK, cells. Offit said those cells are ""free from any virus.""
Many of the posts advancing the false claim attribute it to Rashid Buttar, an osteopathic doctor who has spread conspiracy theories online. Buttar has been previously reprimanded (including last year) by the North Carolina Medical Board. In 2010, he accepted a reprimand and agreed to provide patients with a consent form disclosing that the ""treatment and therapies that are to be provided by Dr. Buttar have not been proven effective by traditional research studies or conventional clinical trials.""
Buttar made remarks about the false positives, similar to the Facebook claims, in a video that has appeared across social media platforms since April.
""All the way back to 1984, all the way up to now, 2018, there are multiple studies that show that if you’ve had the flu shot — especially the trivalent flu shot — false positives on COVID-19 testing,"" Buttar claims. Later, he adds: ""The studies clearly show that if you’ve had a flu shot, you’re going to test positive for COVID-19.""
But the novel coronavirus wasn’t discovered until late 2019, so there couldn’t have been studies between 1984 and 2018 that looked at false positive test results for the virus that causes COVID-19.
The fact-checking website Health Feedback previously debunked the same claim when it was being circulated with references to a 2012 study in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The study compared the incidence of non-influenza respiratory viruses in children who had received the trivalent flu vaccine — which protects against three different flu viruses — with those who hadn’t received the vaccine.
The study looked at four types of coronavirus that cause the common cold — not SARS-CoV-2. And, of 69 trivalent flu vaccine recipients, only one tested positive for a coronavirus — which Health Feedback notes is ""insufficient to draw any causal association between the flu shot and coronavirus detection.""
Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email that ""[f]lu vaccines will not cause false positive tests in people infected with SARS-CoV2. The influenza virus is very different from coronaviruses.""
""If the influenza vaccine produced antibodies against SARS-CoV2, we would not be seeing so many severe cases of Covid19,"" he said. ""Are these people claiming that the flu vaccine also protects against Covid19?"" (It doesn’t.)
And Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiology professor at the Columbia University Medical Center, said he also was aware of no evidence to support the claim that flu shots would cause false positive results for COVID-19.
""The fact that there were individuals who tested negative for the coronavirus suggests that this can’t be true, as a number of them must have had flu shots, certainly within the past ten years,"" he said in an email.

		Quick Take
A misleading chart being spread on Facebook, erroneously dubbing the new coronavirus the ""least deadly virus,"" contains outdated information about the coronavirus and erroneous information about the death rate of the 2009 pandemic of H1N1.


Full Story 
Health officials around the world don’t yet know with certainty the death rate of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, but some U.S. officials are currently estimating the disease is 10 times more fatal than the seasonal flu.
Posts circulating on Facebook, however, are erroneously dubbing the coronavirus the ""least deadly virus"" by spreading a chart homing in on fatality rates of other viruses. The chart was actually published in January, so it cites old data about coronavirus cases and deaths, and it contains an error that makes COVID-19 look less fatal than the 2009 H1N1 ""swine flu"" outbreak.
First, some context: While the World Health Organization has previously estimated the fatality rate of COVID-19 to be around 3.4%, that figure relies on known, confirmed cases of the disease — as we’ve previously written. The number very well may fall under 1%, as President Donald Trump has suggested, as more data about the total number of cases becomes available.
Still, an estimated 1% fatality rate is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, whose mortality rate is about 0.1% — a point Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed to Congress on March 11.
The misleading chart, however, would suggest the virus is not so harmful. One user sharing the post in a conspiracy theory group said the virus was the ""least deadly"" and ""most-hyped by the media."" His post alone was then shared by more than 10,000 others.
The chart was first published in a Jan. 30 story on Business Insider attempting to convey how the novel coronavirus compared to previous outbreaks; it did not include the ""least deadly virus"" label.
The numbers of novel coronavirus cases and deaths in that original chart, now spreading on Facebook, are listed as 9,812 and 213 respectively; the fatality rate is listed as 3.2% (below the fatality rate of several other viruses included in the chart). Those figures for the coronavirus are now outdated. As of March 16, there have been more than 174,000 confirmed cases and more than 6,700 deaths.
Further, the chart contains wrong information about the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 and lists the death rate of that outbreak as 17.4%. Business Insider later corrected the chart to show that that outbreak had a 0.02% fatality rate — consistent with an estimate from a 2013 study analyzing the pandemic — and issued an editor’s note Feb. 4 alerting readers to that fact.
Shayanne Gal, the digital publication’s graphic designer who created the chart, confirmed as much to us, saying in an email that ""the post on Facebook features an incorrect, outdated version of our chart.""
""We did not claim that the coronavirus is the ‘least deadly virus’, and of course we made sure to state that those were the numbers we had as of the time reported,"" Gal said.
Business Insider’s corrected chart (using data as of Feb. 4) showed that COVID-19 has a higher death rate than H1N1, disproving the ""least deadly virus"" label being used on social media. And while the amended version relied on confirmed cases and deaths as of early February, putting the new coronavirus fatality rate at 2.1%, even the 1% estimate cited by Fauci is much higher than the H1N1 rate.
We’ve previously explained the differences between the two outbreaks and the fact the new coronavirus is significantly more transmissible, and more lethal, than H1N1.

Danish soccer star Christian Eriksen is recovering well after he suffered cardiac arrest and collapsed during a match on June 12. But after the incident, social media posts falsely claimed he had recently been vaccinated for COVID-19 and suggested that led to his collapse. Team officials said he has not been vaccinated.

              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

              How can I report a potential safety issue?

              The CDC and FDA have multiple surveillance systems. People are encouraged to submit information to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which predates this pandemic. Experts comb through the submissions to identify and follow-up on adverse reactions that might be due to the vaccine.
The CDC also debuted a smartphone-based tool called v-safe for COVID-19 vaccines. If you register for the program, you will be asked via text message how you are feeling every day for a week after vaccination and less frequently after that. If your answers indicate a potential problem, someone will contact you for more information.

Full Story
Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen was waiting to receive a throw-in during the first half of his team’s opening Euro 2020 match on June 12 in Copenhagen when he suddenly collapsed, suffering cardiac arrest. He received medical treatment on the field and was awake when he left. He since has undergone an operation and has been released.
But soon after he collapsed during the match, erroneous speculation emerged on social media appearing to link a COVID-19 vaccination to the incident. A since-deleted tweet falsely claimed Eriksen received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on May 31.
""Inter Milan Chief Medic and Cardiologist confirmed that he received the Pfizer vaccine 12 days ago,"" read one tweet attributing the quote to Radio Sportiva. The claim has been reposted on Instagram and Facebook.
But Inter Milan’s director, Giuseppe Marotta, denied the claims and said Eriksen, who also plays for the Italian club, had no previous signs of health issues.
""He didn’t have COVID and wasn’t vaccinated either,"" Marotta reportedly told Rai Sport.
Radio Sportiva also disputed the social media claims, saying on Twitter that the radio station never interviewed any Inter Milan officials about Eriksen’s condition.
Denmark’s match against Finland was nearing the half when Eriksen fell to the ground. The match was suspended after a lengthy delay as medical staff performed CPR and used a defibrillator to resuscitate him. He was taken to a hospital and was later reported to be in stable condition.
The Danish Football Union said in a tweet on June 17 that Eriksen would receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator — a heart starter. The device is necessary after a ""cardiac attack due to rhythm disturbances,"" according to the sports organization.
Eriksen was discharged from the hospital on June 18 after a ""successful operation,"" the sports organization told CNN.

The speculation surrounding Eriksen’s vaccination status came as health officials investigate elevated cases of heart inflammation — particularly in young men — following their second dose of an mRNA vaccine. More than 300 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination have been reported in teens and young adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""I think this is probably a real phenomenon,"" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a hospital video. ""But it is rare, occurring in about one in 50,000 recipients.""
Offit said the symptoms of myocarditis are normally short-lived and can involve chest pain and occasionally shortness of breath. The decision to vaccinate is still a safer choice, he said.
Dr. E Kevin Hall, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, said the patients his institution has seen with suspected post-vaccination myocarditis have done well and have been discharged.
""The cases of possible myocarditis as a result of the COVID vaccines appears to be very rare,"" Hall told us in an email. ""We believe the risks of COVID far outweigh the risks of the possible vaccine side effect.""
The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for any person over age 12. An advisory committee to the agency is expected to review the cases of myocarditis at a meeting this month.

      Trump’s False Claim on Tijuana Coronavirus Cases

		President Donald Trump falsely claimed, ""Tijuana is the most heavily infected place anywhere in the world, as far as the plague is concerned,"" referring to the novel coronavirus.
Trump made the inaccurate statement in remarks June 5 at a roundtable on supporting America’s fishermen in Bangor, Maine.
You don’t have to look very far from the Mexican city to find a place with a much higher infection rate: the city of San Diego, California, right across the border.
Tijuana has had 2,335 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the latest statistics from the Baja California secretary of health. Mexico estimates Tijuana’s 2020 population at 1,789,531 – which would result in an infection rate of 130.5 per 100,000 people. It currently has just 69 active cases.
San Diego has had 3,880 COVID-19 cases and a rate of 273.3 cases per 100,000 through June 8, according to the county website. That’s twice as high as Tijuana’s rate.
At the same time, though, COVID-19 has been much deadlier in Tijuana. The city has experienced 643 deaths, while all of San Diego County, which includes the city, has had 301.
San Diego is hardly the only place with more infection than Tijuana.
For example, the District of Columbia, home of the White House and the Trump International Hotel, has about half of Tijuana’s population. Yet, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center, the nation’s capital, as of June 10, has had 9,474 cases of COVID-19, or 1,348.7 cases per 100,000 residents — a rate that is about 10 times higher than the Mexican city.

And the numbers are far more dramatic in such big-city disease hotspots as Cook County, Illinois, Chicago’s county, whose population of about 5.15 million has suffered 83,271 cases, and Los Angeles County, population about 10 million, with 65,945 cases. 
Queens County, New York, where Trump grew up, has had 62,466 cases for a rate of 2,741 cases per 100,000 — 21 times Tijuana’s rate, according to Johns Hopkins. 
And Palm Beach, Florida, home of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, also has a far higher per capita rate than Tijuana. As of June 10, it has had 7,518 cases or 505.9 cases per 100,000 – nearly four times Tijuana’s rate.
Baja California Gov. Jaime Bonilla fired back at Trump’s off-base shot at Tijuana. ""Mr. Trump sees the straw in someone else’s eye but does not see the beam in his own — instead of looking at the other side of the fence to see what is wrong, first take a look within your own house,"" Bonilla said.
But Tijuana Mayor Arturo González said he felt Trump’s pain.
""The statements made by @realDonaldTrump are understandable, I don’t judge it,"" the mayor tweeted. ""In the country with the most Covid 19 deaths in the world, protests in more than 50 cities and elections on the doorstep, it is understandable that he has to distract attention from something or someone and it was our turn #Tijuana.""
Trump has mentioned Tijuana and the coronavirus before in connection with his campaign to build a wall to improve security along the Mexican border.
Trump, May 5: And in Tijuana, right along the border, they have a tremendous outbreak. And we have just completed 172 miles of wall. And it’s real wall, not the kind you were having built over the years that were sort of scoffed at, right?
He sounded a similar note three weeks later.
Trump, May 28: Mexico is having a very, very hard time, as you know, with COVID, especially along the border … with Tijuana and various places along the border. And fortunately, we have brand-new wall along there, and the wall is saving us.
While Trump was wrong about Tijuana’s numbers, there is no doubt Mexico, as so much of the world, has been hit hard by COVID-19. But not as badly as the United States.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University as of June 10, Mexico has 124,301 cases and 14,649 deaths. There have been 1,973,230 cases and 111,694 deaths in the U.S. The U.S. has a death rate (34.14 deaths per 100,000 people) that is nearly three times Mexico’s (11.61 deaths per 100,000).

		Less than a week after being hospitalized due to COVID-19, President Donald Trump now says, ""I don’t think I’m contagious at all."" But according to medical experts and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the president may very well still be contagious and ought to be isolated.
In a phone interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business on the morning of Oct. 8, Trump said he was feeling good and looking forward to resuming campaign rallies.
""I think I’m better to a point where I’d love to do a rally tonight, I wanted to do one last night, but I think I’m better to a point that I feel better than I did you know, I jokingly said 20 years ago, I feel perfect,"" Trump said. ""There’s nothing wrong. I had a case, I got it knocked out.""
""I don’t think I’m contagious at all,"" Trump added. ""Well, first of all, if I’m at a rally I’d stand by myself very far away from everybody, whether I was or not. But I still wouldn’t go to rally if I was contagious.""
Trump may not think he is contagious, but according to the CDC ""persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset."" People with more severe illness may be infectious longer than that.
The CDC recommends that, ""For most persons with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms.""
Trump announced very early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus. In a press conference later that morning, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing ""mild symptoms."" Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he spent three days getting treatment before being discharged back to the White House on Oct. 5.
In an Oct. 7 memo, Trump’s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said the president has ""now been fever-free for more than 4 days, symptom-free for over 24 hours, and has not needed or received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization.""
Still, Trump’s statement that he no longer believed he was contagious came just seven days after he first began to experience symptoms. In an interview on MSNBC, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the president’s pronouncement was premature.
""Well, you know the general guideline from the CDC says that 10 days from the onset of symptoms, that you can essentially consider someone noninfectious,"" Fauci said. ""You can definitively show that by another one of the recommendations that had been made about two negative PCR tests, 24 hours apart. So if the president goes 10 days without symptoms and they do the test that we were talking about, then you could make the assumption, based on good science, that he is not infected. But you just have to wait and make sure you go through those particular benchmarks that are delineated in the CDC guidelines.""
In a press call on Oct. 7, the day before Trump said he thought he was no longer infectious, Dr. Roger Shapiro, associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that patients with ""mild or even moderate disease"" may be ""rendered non-infectious in about 10 days just by natural course of the illness and immune control that would be expected for most individuals.""
""However,"" he said, ""people with more severe disease can remain infectious for 20 days or even longer.""
There is ""a real possibility"" Trump fits in that latter category, Shapiro said, ""and it might be made even greater by the fact that President Trump received steroids."" Steroids, he added, can be ""very helpful in reducing mortality, especially late in the illness,"" but ""we don’t yet know the effect that they may have in terms of prolonging the shedding of virus.""
On Oct. 4, Conley said that Trump had experienced ""two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation,"" indicating Trump’s lungs may be compromised. As a result, the president began to take dexamethasone, a steroid drug.
""It really depends on how severe his COVID is,"" Shapiro said. ""And that is a matter of some debate right now. … It is unclear whether he is in a more moderate category or whether he really tipped over towards a severe disease, which would be suggested by the fact that he received the dexamethasone for his illness.""
""So I think it’s still is a real unknown as to whether or not, President Trump will be shedding virus in the middle of next week,"" Shapiro said.
Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, told CNBC the president’s comments are ""truly unbelievable"" and the fact that he is considering holding a rally is ""mind blowing.""

""Just less than a week ago, the president was in a hospital being treated for severe illness,"" said Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University. ""It’s very likely that he’s still shedding virus right now.""
Dr. Syra Madad, senior director of the systemwide special pathogens program at New York City Health + Hospitals, told CNBC the president ought to isolate for at least 10 days, per the evidence-based CDC guidance.
""If [Trump’s] not going to isolate for that full period when he may be infectious, then, as a doctor, why would we tell other people to do the same,"" Madad said. ""Why should they listen to us when the president of the United States isn’t abiding by his own public health measures?""

		Quick Take
A viral video makes the bogus claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Jan. 31 tweet criticized the Trump administration’s restriction on travelers from China to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Her tweet was unrelated to those travel restrictions.

Full Story
President Donald Trump instituted travel restrictions on five Muslim majority countries during his first year in office. This year, on Jan. 31, he added more countries to the list.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has opposed that policy from the start, took to Twitter to criticize the expansion, calling it an ""un-American travel ban.""
Now, two months later, a video that’s been viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook and YouTube falsely claims that her tweet was about Trump’s decision on the same day to restrict travelers coming from China in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
These are two distinct and unrelated actions that were each taken on Jan. 31. Pelosi’s tweet wasn’t about the restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus.
In the first instance, Trump expanded his controversial ban on certain foreign nationals from mostly predominately Muslim countries. He added six new countries to the existing list of those affected — Burma (Myanmar), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. Half of them are majority Muslim, according to the Pew Research Center.
Pelosi responded to that expansion in a tweet that said: ""The Trump Admin’s expansion of its un-American travel ban is a threat to our security, our values and the rule of law. Barring more than 350 million people from predominantly African countries from traveling to the US, this rule is discrimination disguised as policy.""
The video claims that tweet is evidence that Pelosi had initially characterized Trump’s move to restrict travel from China as ""overreacting"" to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
It’s not. As we said, her tweet was addressing an unrelated policy that was signed on the same day.
In the second action, which was aimed at addressing the spread of the novel-coronavirus, Trump limited travel for non-U.S. citizens, except for the immediate family of citizens and permanent residents, who were in China within two weeks of coming to the U.S.
Pelosi has not addressed that policy on Twitter, or anywhere else that we could find. We searched the Congressional Record, reviewed her weekly press briefings and other public appearances, and scoured news coverage on LexisNexis. We could find no comment from Pelosi regarding her position on that decision.
""The Dan Bongino Show,"" which posted the video, did not respond to a request for comment.

      Trump Baselessly Claims Coronavirus Will ‘Go Away’ Without Vaccine

		At a White House meeting with fellow Republicans, President Donald Trump said, without evidence, that the coronavirus ""is going to go away without a vaccine."" While it’s impossible to predict the future, experts say it’s unlikely that the virus will simply go away.
His son Eric went even further in a May 16 interview, claiming that coronavirus ""will magically all of a sudden go away"" after the November election.
""It is completely fanciful and not evidence-based to state that SARS-CoV-2 will ‘go away’ without a vaccine,"" said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, referring to the full name of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. ""There is no basis for this statement.""
""It is a theoretical possibility that the virus could go away permanently with a large uncontrolled epidemic everywhere in the world, leading to depletion of susceptible people and permanent immunity,"" Lipsitch added in an email.
But, he said, that series of events would be ""exceedingly unlikely,"" since no human coronavirus is known to elicit permanent immunity, and because countries will maintain a pool of people susceptible to the virus for a long time, allowing for reintroductions of the virus. 
To state that the virus will go away without a vaccine is ""baseless,"" Lipsitch said, and to consider it as one of the top scenarios for policy planning is ""foolish.""
In an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, also objected to Trump’s claim that the virus would ""go away"" without a vaccine.
""No, this virus isn’t going to go away,"" he said. ""Hopefully, over time, we’ll learn to live with it and we’ll be able to reduce the risk of transmission. But it’s going to stay as a background problem in the country and around the world until we have a vaccine.""
Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at Harvard, also told us he did not think the virus would go away without a vaccine.
Trump’s comments came during a May 8 meeting at the White House with Republican members of Congress in response to a reporter’s question about how necessary a vaccine is to resolving the pandemic.
Trump, May 8: Well, I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests. This is going to go away without a vaccine. It’s going to go away, and it’s — we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time. You may have some — some flare-ups and I guess, you know, I would expect that. Sometime in the fall, you’ll have flare-ups maybe. Maybe not. But according to what a lot of people say, you probably will. We’ll be able to put them out. You may have some flare-ups next year, but eventually, it’s going to be gone. I mean, it’s going to be gone.
You know, there are some viruses and flus that came, and they went for a vaccine, they never found the vaccine, and they’ve disappeared. They’ve never shown up again. They got — they die too, like everything else. They die too.
When asked for evidence for his position in a follow-up question, Trump said he relied ""on what doctors say,"" adding, ""They say it’s going to go — that doesn’t mean this year, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be gone, frankly, by the fall or after the fall. But eventually, it’s going to go away. The question is will we need a vaccine? At some point, it will probably go away by itself. If we had a vaccine, that would be very helpful. I’d be very happy to have a vaccine.""
The White House did not respond to our requests for support for the statement or for clarification on what the president meant by ""go away."" But back in February, Trump made a similar claim, suggesting that because of warmer weather, the coronavirus would ""go away"" in April — a prediction that, as we explained, was highly uncertain even at the time, and did not come to pass. 
And in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on May 16, the president’s son Eric Trump used similar language to make the groundless claim that the coronavirus is a Democratic ploy to keep his father from doing arena-style campaigning. ""You watch, they’ll milk it every single day between now and Nov. 3,"" the younger Trump said of Democrats. ""And guess what? After Nov. 3, coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen.""
While the president is right that the pandemic will eventually wane, scientists do not anticipate a speedy retreat — and even with a vaccine, there is a chance the virus will continue to stick around.
""Viruses do not do anything magically,"" said Lipsitch. ""All scientific evidence and reasoning indicates that SARS-CoV-2 will be spreading in large parts of the human population for months or years to come, in the absence of widespread use of an effective vaccine.""
Virus Unlikely to ‘Disappear’
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a prominent member of the coronavirus task force, has said that it will take a vaccine to allow society to let up on all of its mitigation efforts. 
""It’s not going to be over to the point of our being able to not do any mitigation until we have a scientifically sound, safe and effective vaccine,"" he said in an April 16 television interview on Fox News’ ""The Ingraham Angle.""
And Fauci pushed back when host Laura Ingraham suggested, as Trump later did, that this virus might ""disappear"" the way SARS did.
""Anything could, Laura, but I have to tell you, the degree of efficiency, of transmissibility of this is really unprecedented in anything that I’ve seen,"" he said. ""It’s an extraordinarily efficient virus in transmitting from one person to another. Those kinds of viruses don’t just disappear.""
In Senate testimony on May 12, Fauci again said of the virus disappearing, ""That is just not going to happen,"" adding that even if there is better control of the virus in the summer, ""it is likely that there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will eventually get back to us.""
Fauci also previously cautioned that while conditions in the U.S. would improve, there could be an ongoing risk. 
""[I]f you want to get to pre-coronavirus, you know, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there,"" he said in an April 6 task force briefing. ""But I believe, with the therapies that will be coming online, and with the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine, that we will never have to get back to where we are right back now.""
The World Health Organization, too, has said that while a vaccine is humanity’s best chance of getting rid of the virus, even then, there is no guarantee that the virus will go completely away.
""I think it’s important to put this on the table,"" said Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, in a May 13 press conference. ""This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away.""
""I don’t think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear. We do have one great hope,"" Ryan continued. ""If we do find a highly effective vaccine that we can distribute to everyone who needs it in the world, we may have a shot at eliminating this virus. But that vaccine will have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone and we will have to use it.""
Ryan noted that the world has failed to eliminate other viral diseases, such as measles, even with readily available, effective vaccines.
""There are no promises in this and there are no dates,"" he said, adding that there was a possibility COVID-19 might ""settle into a long-term problem.""
COVID-19 Projections
How the COVID-19 pandemic will unfold can’t be known, but some scientists have attempted to model how the virus will spread under different assumptions to understand what the possibilities might be.
Lipsitch was part of a team at Harvard that created a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate regions of the world, factoring in different levels of seasonality, immunity and cross-immunity to two common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1.
Publishing in the journal Science in mid-April, the team found that repeated wintertime outbreaks ""will probably occur,"" and even if the virus might appear to go away, ""a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.""
In many of the team’s simulations, SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate long-term. If immunity to the virus lasts a bit less than a year — on par with the common cold coronaviruses — then the coronavirus might return annually. A longer, two-year period of immunity pushes the virus’s reappearance into a biennial or more sporadic pattern.
In the unlikely case that immunity is permanent, then the virus could disappear for five or more years, the study found. But even in cases in which the virus might seem to die out, SARS-CoV-2 could make a comeback several years later.
These scenarios do not factor in any mitigation measures, but other modeling from the group suggests that one-time lockdowns won’t be enough to control the virus.
""We found that one-time social distancing measures are likely to be insufficient to maintain the incidence of SARS-COV-2 within the limits of critical care capacity in the United States,"" said co-author Stephen Kissler, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard, in a press call. ""And so what seems could be necessary in the absence of other sorts of treatments are intermittent social distancing periods.""
While the team does not endorse any particular strategy, the basic idea with intermittent social distancing would be to try to space out the number of infections enough so that the health care system never gets overloaded, but that over time, immunity to the virus builds. 
If approximately 50-67% of a given population were to become infected and develop immunity, then that could provide so-called community or herd immunity, preventing spread to those who still remain susceptible — and causing outbreaks to eventually peter out.
This type of slow-build immunity approach is one way that the pandemic could end without a vaccine, Annelies Wilder-Smith, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told us. (The other involves a highly unlikely global containment effort, involving a simultaneous Wuhan-level lockdown in every country.) 
But it would take a long time, she said — perhaps two to four years — and, as we’ve established, would not necessarily bring a true end to the virus.
Work by others also suggests the virus will be around for the long haul. In an April 30 report released by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, researchers outlined three possible scenarios, based on what is known about SARS-CoV-2 and past experience with epidemics.
In the first so-called ""peaks and valleys"" scenario, the first wave of infection would be followed by a series of well-defined waves that gradually diminish in 2021.
In a second scenario, the virus returns in the fall or winter with a vengeance — akin to what happened with the 1918 influenza pandemic — producing a much larger wave of infections than the current one, followed up by smaller subsequent waves.
In the third ""slow burn"" scenario, infections would continue at a lower level after the first surge, but wouldn’t follow a clear wave pattern.
Regardless of the scenario the pandemic follows, the report cautions that ""we must be prepared for at least another 18 to 24 months of significant COVID-19 activity, with hot spots popping up periodically in diverse geographic areas.""
And the report notes that the virus may not go away, even if the pandemic resolves. 
""As the pandemic wanes, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population and will synchronize to a seasonal pattern with diminished severity over time,"" similar to what has happened with past pandemic influenza viruses and the more mild human coronaviruses that cause colds.
Past Viruses
Indeed, although Trump suggested that viruses disappear, never to return, without vaccines, that’s not actually what happens in most cases.
""I’m hard pressed to think of any viruses that ‘disappeared’ on their own,"" Columbia epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us. ""Once they gain a foothold, most viruses are hard to eliminate, especially respiratory viruses. Influenza – flu — doesn’t go away, it just keeps coming back in new guises.""
Far from disappearing, even after all the waves of a pandemic conclude, pandemic influenza viruses return as seasonal influenza viruses. 
""They settle down and evolve, a key surface protein (the hemagglutinin, H) mutating to get past our immune systems,"" said Morse, allowing ""the new variant to reinfect, even people already immune from having had the pandemic.""
Versions of the H1N1 influenza strain that caused the 2009 pandemic, for example, continue to circulate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the virus led to at least 100 million illnesses and 75,000 deaths between 2009 and 2018 in the U.S. alone — and that is with a vaccine that became available in October 2009 and is estimated to have prevented up to 1.5 million clinical cases.
In fact, Morse said every seasonal flu the world knows is the descendant of a pandemic virus.
The common cold coronaviruses that infect humans today are also examples of viruses that never disappeared. These viruses are thought to have emerged from animals in the past, the most recent one around 1890, according to a genetic analysis of OC43. Although still speculative, the authors of that study think it’s possible that OC43 may have been responsible for the 1889-1890 pandemic when it crossed over into humans from cows. 
These coronaviruses do not mutate to the extent that influenza does, Morse said. But immunity to the viruses is short-lived, so the viruses are able to reinfect people after a period of time and also tend to exhibit a seasonal pattern.
There is the example of the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, virus, which led to an outbreak in 2003 that was successfully contained. Other than a few lingering cases and a couple mishaps in a lab in 2004, the virus has not returned — although there is still the risk the virus could reemerge if humans interact with animals harboring the virus.
But that virus never spread as widely as SARS-CoV-2, infecting only about 8,000 people in fewer than 30 countries. In contrast, as of May 19, there have been more than 4.6 million COVID-19 cases in 188 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker.
SARS-CoV-1, Morse said, was not as transmissible as its successor, and the bulk of the transmission was in health care settings. ""Once the affected facilities implemented rigorous infection control,"" he said, ""they could control SARS in the facility and it eventually stopped.""
What will ultimately happen with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, as the trajectory, Morse said, will depend ""on the virus, on how we behave, and on our immune systems.""
But there is little precedent for a virus that has spread so efficiently to ""go away,"" as the president claimed.
Morse said that long-term, there isn’t enough evidence to know whether the coronavirus will follow the path of a seasonal flu virus — mutating and periodically reinfecting — or that of a seasonal coronavirus, periodically reinfecting after a while, and usually causing a milder disease. 
""Whatever the scenario,"" he said, ""it’s likely we’ll be dealing with it, and its consequences, for some time to come.""

		Quick Take
A viral headline on Facebook claims that a vaccine isn’t ""Needed"" for COVID-19 because ""There Is Already A Cure."" But the supposed ""cure"" is an asthma medication, touted by a Texas doctor, that has not yet been proven in clinical trials as an effective treatment for COVID-19 — though researchers are exploring its efficacy.


Full Story 
In a video interview shared on social media in early July, a Texas doctor promised a ""silver bullet"" and ""cure"" for COVID-19.
The answer, Dr. Richard Bartlett claimed, is an existing asthma medicine — inhaled budesonide, a corticosteroid — whose success, he suggests, negates the need for a vaccine. The video has racked up 4 million views on YouTube and its claims have migrated elsewhere. A headline shared on Facebook nearly 40,000 times, for example, claims that ""COVID-19 No Vaccine Needed, There Is Already A Cure.""
But experts say the medication has not yet been proven as an effective treatment for COVID-19 and, even if helpful, wouldn’t dismiss the need for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus that causes the disease — which would help to prevent people from becoming sick in the first place. The World Health Organization also notes that there is ""currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19.""
Bartlett, a general practice doctor who initiated a short-lived run for Congress as a Republican in 2019, said in his interview on the conservative talk show ""America Can We Talk?"" that he uses a nebulizer machine to administer the budesonide. He said he also uses zinc and clarithromycin, an antibiotic.
""My silver bullet is inhaled budesonide,"" he said. ""It works. One hundred percent of my patients are alive."" He said that patients ""tell me, ‘I feel better during the first treatment,’ and so their chest pain goes away, their shortness of breath goes away, their fever breaks.""
In describing the success of one patient, he refers to the treatment as a ""cure.""
Mona Bafadhel, associate professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Oxford, told us in an email that ""there is NO evidence to suggest that inhaled budesonide or any inhaled steroids (ICS) is a cure for COVID."" (Emphasis is hers.)
Bafadhel is currently conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the use of inhaled budesonide to treat patients with early COVID-19 infection.
""If ICS were proven to be successful, as a treatment, this would NOT mean we don’t need a vaccine,"" she said.
(Update, Feb. 10, 2021: Unpublished results from Bafadhel’s study, posted to the preprint server medRxiv, suggest that giving inhaled budesonide soon after developing symptoms can reduce the need for urgent care or hospitalization and shorten recovery time.)
Dr. Mitchell Grayson, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital at Ohio State University College of Medicine, also said in a phone interview that ""the jury is out"" on whether inhaled corticosteroids will help with treatment of COVID-19. Grayson briefly evaluated the dearth of evidence available on the issue for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.
""I don’t see any strong signals that would make me think that inhaled steroids are going to be remarkably better,"" he said, but a clinical trial is the only way to know more definitively.
Grayson said one possibility is that the steroid could help temper the immune system’s overreaction to the disease, since that overreaction can lead people to getting seriously ill.
Bartlett recently started a website, ""covidsilverbullet.com,"" where he has published a case study of inhaled budesonide that involves two patients treated via telemedicine. The patients — a 63-year-old woman and 38-year-old man — both are reported to have preexisting conditions and use other medications, too.
""It’s very hard to make any kinds of heads or tails out of"" the case study, Grayson said.
A large, randomized clinical trial in the U.K. by the RECOVERY group found that 22.9% of COVID-19 patients allocated dexamethasone — another steroid — by mouth or intravenously died within 28 days, as opposed to 25.7% of patients allocated usual care. It was most effective among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.
The study only looked at hospitalized patients and did not look at inhaled steroids. It also did not find a benefit for those not receiving respiratory support.
In a July 30 commentary for The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Bafadhel and Dan Nicolau, a physician and mathematician at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, lay out the hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids ""could be a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 for several reasons.""
""We would propose that ICS could have a dual role: first, reducing the inflammatory [acute respiratory distress syndrome-like] response affecting a minority of patients with COVID-19; and second, directly inhibiting viral replication,"" they note. They later add: ""Whether use of ICS protects against COVID-19 is still unknown, but to dismiss this hypothesis as nonsense is premature.""
In addition to Bafadehl’s study, there are several other clinical trials also exploring inhaled corticosteroids and COVID-19.
But in the viral video, Bartlett dubiously suggests the medication is already being used so widely as to keep COVID-19 fatalities low in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Iceland. ""They’re doing what I’m doing … an inhaled steroid,"" he claims.
The WHO, in a statement provided to FactCheck.org, said ""there is no evidence suggesting that inhaled corticosteroid have reduced case fatality rate in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, and Iceland.""
Taiwan, with a population of nearly 24 million, has reported only 475 COVID-19 cases and seven deaths — but it’s not because of an inhaled steroid, said Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy research analyst at Princeton University who has written about Taiwan’s health care system and closely follows the country’s COVID-19 response.
Cheng said in a phone interview that she had ""never"" heard of such a treatment being responsible for low fatalities. Instead, she said the country prepared itself for such a crisis in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. She said the country’s leadership (including a central command system), a national policy, and ""very, very strict, effective quarantine and contact tracing"" protocols helped to prevent the disease from spreading within the country.
The WHO statement also said that ""[t]here is limited information on possible effect of inhaled steroids and there is no evidence there is any advantage to use this route of administration to improve patient outcomes."" (Emphasis is theirs.)
""Available evidence from randomized clinical trials such as RECOVERY suggest that systemic corticosteroids"" — meaning, taken orally or through a shot — ""provide benefits in reducing mortality in severe and critically ill patients requiring respiratory support,"" it noted. ""In addition, data indicate that [there is] no benefit of systemic corticosteroids in patients who did not require supplemental oxygen.""
Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security who studies infectious diseases, also said in an email that ""[t]here is no definitive evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide in the treatment of COVID-19. While there is biological plausibility that such a treatment could have a beneficial role it can only be determined in a proper clinical trial.""
Adalja cautioned that ""[w]hen it comes to steroid treatments for COVID19 it is important to realize that, as was shown with systemic steroid treatment, there is an appropriate and inappropriate time to administer them."" He also said ""inhaled corticosteroids are not benign and have a range of side effects that range from osteoporosis to making one more vulnerable to bacterial pneumonia so I would not advise the use of such treatments for COVID19 outside of a clinical trial or protocol (though those prescribed them for other reasons should continue taking them).""

In a subsequent interview, with the conservative outlet One America News Network, Bartlett said that a hospital in Texas south of San Antonio — Frio Regional Hospital — ""emptied"" its ICU of COVID-19 patients by using inhaled budesonide.
The CEO of the hospital, John Hughson, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview that the hospital, which typically has a 25-bed capacity, did use inhaled budesonide on three patients in a room converted into an ICU — and that they improved several days later and were discharged. He said he believes the inhaled budesonide can be effective for some patients and that while some doctors at the hospital use it, others haven’t adopted it.
Hughson noted that ""it is a very, very small sample size and all those patients were on high-flow oxygen.""
""It’s up to the physician’s discretion and their medical judgment … if they initiate the therapy at all,"" he said. ""I would also say that’s not the only treatment we use.""
""I wouldn’t say this is indicated for every patient, it is not the magic cure for everything, and it is not going to keep everyone from getting the disease,"" he added.
On that point, Bartlett also suggested — in his earlier interview — that a vaccine isn’t needed if inhaled budesonide is being widely used. For example, after advancing the baseless claim about Taiwan’s wide adoption of the steroid, he says: ""Taiwan, 24 million people, they don’t need to wait for a vaccine — they don’t have a problem that you should vaccinate 24 million people for.""

Adalja, however, said that ""no treatment will obviate the need for a vaccine — a vaccine is the only way to remove this virus as a threat to human health.""
And Cheng, who said she has spoken recently with both Taiwan’s former health minister and the current health minister, dismissed the suggestion that the country isn’t in need of a vaccine. She said Taiwan is putting many resources into vaccine development and negotiating with vaccine manufacturers to ensure that, when one is ready, the country can procure enough doses to begin with protecting health care workers — followed by the rest of the population.

		Quick Take
Social media posts falsely suggest that meatpacking workers have suffered more COVID-19 cases than health care workers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there’s an increased risk for workers in both professions, but there have been significantly more cases reported among health care employees.
Full Story
Health care personnel have been on the front lines of the battle to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Each day they have direct or indirect exposure to infected patients or infectious materials. 
Despite their best efforts to protect themselves during the pandemic — made difficult due to widespread shortages in personal protective equipment — more than 9,200 health care workers had been infected with the disease in the U.S., as of April 17, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But viral memes on Facebook have spread misinformation about the impact the novel coronavirus has had on health care workers. In one post, a Facebook user shared a meme that read, ""DON’T YOU FIND IT QUITE INTERESTING, THAT 5,000 MEAT PACKERS TESTED POSITIVE! HOWEVER, NOT 5,000 NURSES & DOCTORS!""
 A similar post was shared with the caption, ""Ready for the food shortage?"" — implying that a meat shortage is being intentionally planned. 
The meatpacking industry has been hit particularly hard by the disease. More than 4,900 workers at 115 meat and poultry processing facilities have been infected with the virus and 20 have died, according to a May 8 report released by the CDC. Several factors have played into the spike in infections in the food industry, according to the CDC, including ""difficulties with workplace physical distancing and hygiene and crowded living and transportation conditions.""
COVID-19’s prevalence among food processing workers has caused a disruption to the industry. At least 30 meatpacking plants have closed at some point during the last two months, and the pandemic has caused a 40 percent reduction in pork slaughter capacity and a 25 percent reduction in beef slaughter capacity, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.
In an effort to maintain the food supply chain, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on April 28 that resulted in the reopening of 14 meatpacking facilities. 
But UFCW International President Marc Perrone opposed the measure without safety improvements, saying meatpacking workers are ""putting their lives on the line every day to make sure our families have the food they need,"" and he called for more protection for employees of the plants.
Still, the memes’ statement that more meatpackers have been infected than doctors, nurses and other health care workers is incorrect, as we’ve noted.
More than 9,200 health care workers have been infected in the U.S., including 27 workers who have died, according to an April 17 report from the CDC. Those numbers are likely an undercount, the agency said, since only 16% of COVID-19 cases reported to the CDC included information on whether or not the patients were health care workers. The report also noted that health care personnel with mild or asymptomatic infections may have been ""less likely to be tested, thus less likely to be reported."" 
A CDC spokesperson told us that the agency did not have updated information on the number of health care workers infected.
But the CDC has reported that the number of COVID-19 cases among health care workers ""is expected to rise as more U.S. communities experience widespread transmission.""

		Quick Take
The U.S. military may assist in the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available, but it will not forcibly administer vaccines, as a viral article shared on social media falsely suggests. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has said mandatory vaccination ""would be unenforceable and not appropriate.""

Full Story
Researchers around the world are racing to develop vaccines to counter the COVID-19 virus, and Trump administration officials have said one could be available in the U.S. sometime between the end of this year and early 2021, as we’ve reported.
While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal health agencies draw up guidelines on who will receive the vaccines first, the military also is helping the CDC to coordinate supply, production and distribution around the country.
In August, at a news conference announcing the U.S. would buy 100 million doses of an experimental vaccine, President Donald Trump affirmed earlier statements that the military would be involved in its distribution. ""We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure rapid delivery. The military is ready to go, they’re ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA and we’re moving very close to that approval,"" Trump said.
But a viral article on the website Before It’s News suggests, without offering any support, that the military will assist in forcible administration of the vaccines.
""Trump has the military lined up and ready to distribute this vaccine to the public, whether you want it or not,"" the article reads, adding: ""If you decide you don’t want it, don’t worry, the military will help convince you."" 
The article carries the false headline, ""The Government Has Released Their Initial Plans to Force a Vaccine on Everyone.""
There is no indication that the military will do more than help coordinate production and delivery of the vaccines once they become available.
As we previously reported, the Department of Defense will assist in distribution, according to a senior administration official who spoke at a July 30 background briefing.
The baseless claim in the Before It’s News article that the vaccines will be forcibly administered feeds into the fears of people who are opposed to vaccines for a range of reasons, including questions of personal liberty.
According to a survey by the Pew Research Center last month, only about half of those asked said they would definitely or probably get a vaccine, a steep drop from 72% in May, a decline attributed to concerns about the safety or efficacy of a new vaccine. A quarter of those surveyed said they definitely would not get one.
Experts have said the federal government does not have the power to mandate universal vaccination, but it can require vaccines in certain situations, such as obtaining a green card or serving in the military.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said he does not support universal mandates. ""You don’t want to mandate and try and force anyone to take the vaccine. We’ve never done that. You can mandate for certain groups of people like health workers, but for the general population you can’t,"" Fauci said in August.
""We don’t want to be mandating from the federal government to the general population,"" he said. ""It would be unenforceable and not appropriate.""
States and cities have greater powers to require vaccines, including during health emergencies, to attend school or for government employment, according to legal experts. Employers also can require employees be vaccinated.
The one general exemption from getting a vaccine is on religious grounds.
Debbie Kaminer, a law professor at Baruch College in New York who has written about vaccination laws and exemptions, told Healthline that the best way to get people vaccinated is through an effective education campaign that should begin sooner rather than later. She noted that polio vaccine rates soared in 1956 after Elvis Presley got one on the ""Ed Sullivan Show.""
A request for comment from the CDC on the military’s role in a vaccination effort was referred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HHS did not immediately respond for this article.
In August, an HHS official told us that the military ""may be called on to provide a complementary role to the traditional vaccine distribution networks where speed of response or distribution to remote sites requires DOD augmentation.""

      Painting of Children in Masks Isn’t a 1994 Airport Mural

		Quick Take
Viral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994 — and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.


Full Story 
Facebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.
Specifically, the posts claim that the artwork — depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries — was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.
""The Denver airport mural painted in 1994,"" the posts read. ""Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?""
But the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airport’s public art available on the airport’s website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is ""not from DEN’s art collection."" The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.
There is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. It’s called ""Children of the World Dream of Peace,"" but it doesn’t include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)
As for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.
In late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting — posted by Trinidad days earlier — on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece ""Maskcommunication.""
Trinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.
But the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.
It was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, ""United Against Corona- Express through Art,"" by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.
 
The competition website lists the ""[d]ate of submission"" as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020. 
The photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February — though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.
In the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name ""NEHA"" appears in the top left corner of the painting.
We reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting — and we’ll update this story if we hear back.
Either way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994 — and it’s false to say that it’s a mural in the Denver airport.

		President Donald Trump recently said ""close to 100 million people died"" from the 1918 Spanish flu, and that ""if you got it you had a 50/50 chance, or very close, of dying."" But 100 million is a high-end estimate of global deaths from that influenza pandemic, and we found no evidence the case fatality rate for those who had it was 50%.
Trump made those claims during a March 24 virtual town hall from the White House Rose Garden that aired on Fox News. He argued that the current coronavirus pandemic cannot be compared to the 1918 flu pandemic because of how deadly the latter was.
Trump, March 24: You can’t compare this to 1918 where close to 100 million people died. That was a flu, which — a little different. But that was a flu where if you got it you had a 50/50 chance, or very close, of dying.
I think we’re substantially under 1% because the people that get better are not reporting. So we only know people that go to doctors and go to hospitals, and we’re taking that. And we’re still a little bit above 1%. When you add all of the people — the millions of people that have it, that get better, we’re substantially less than 1%.
Trump has criticized the World Health Organization’s March 3 estimate of a 3.4% global case fatality rate for individuals with COVID-19, the pneumonia-like disease caused by the new coronavirus. The president called it ""a false number"" because it was based on known cases and fatalities and does not account for unreported cases. 
It’s not a false number, as we’ve explained before, but the fatality rate for COVID-19 may end up being much lower — perhaps less than 1% — when more data about the total number of people who had it is available.
Trump’s claims about deaths from the so-called Spanish flu, however, are more suspect. To start, he relied on one of the highest estimates of fatalities; others are lower.
In a 1991 report published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, K. David Patterson and Gerald Pyle estimated that between 24.7 million and 39.3 million people died worldwide during that pandemic — but the authors wrote that ""we believe that approximately 30 million is the best estimate for the terrible demographic toll of the influenza pandemic of 1918."" 
The authors also noted that a much earlier, and much cited, estimate from 1927 put the death toll lower, at 21.6 million. 
Then in a 2002 report, also published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Niall Johnson and Juergen Mueller, referring to those earlier estimates, produced their own — 50 million deaths, globally — which they said may have been an underestimate by as much as 100%. ""Consequently, the real pandemic mortality may fall in the range of 50 to 100 million,"" they wrote.
It appears Trump was referring to that upper estimate.
But more recently, in 2018, Peter Spreeuwenberg, Madelon Kroneman and John Paget did their own analysis — which was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology — and concluded that ""100 million deaths is highly unlikely."" Instead, ""the true estimate,"" the authors wrote, is ""probably closer to our final estimate of 17.4 million deaths (1918 and 1919 combined).""
And even Johnson and Mueller, who estimated as many as 100 million deaths, said ""it would seem unlikely that a truly accurate figure can ever be calculated.""
What we also don’t know for certain is how many people around the world contracted the Spanish flu. 
But if 500 million became infected, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, then those who contracted that influenza strain had a much lower chance of dying than Trump said, based on the previously discussed estimates of deaths.
For instance, if 17.4 million of 500 million infected people died, then the global case fatality rate was about 3.5%. If there were 30 million deaths, then the rate would be 6%. And even if the number of deaths was 50 million or 100 million, then the rate would be between 10% and 20%.
None of those equals a ""50/50"" chance of death, or a ratio ""very close"" to it.

		Quick Take
A viral social media post falsely claims Dr. Anthony Fauci is ""pushing"" remdesivir as a potential COVID-19 treatment drug, because he ""invented"" it with Bill Gates and they stand to profit from it. Remdesivir was invented by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which receives any profit from sales of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.

Full Story
Dr. Anthony Fauci has become a prominent figure during the COVID-19 pandemic since he began speaking regularly at daily press briefings of the White House Coronavirus Task Force in late January. But as a public backlash to mitigation measures has grown, so has the ire directed toward Fauci.
Fauci has been the target of death threats and bogus claims on social media, including a post that falsely claims he is advocating the use of remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19, because he ""invented"" it, along with Bill Gates, and they’ll profit from its use.
""Hydroxychloroquine is cheap – 91% effective. Remdesivir is $1000 – under 50% effective,"" the text meme reads. ""Why is Fauci pushing Remdesivir? It was invented by Fauci and Gates. It’s stock is now soaring. Always follow the $$$$$$$.""
But neither Fauci nor Gates invented or stand to gain from remdesivir.
Since 1984, Fauci has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. Through his work, Fauci has been listed on patents as an inventor, with HHS colleagues, of various drugs, including treatments for HIV/AIDS.
However, HHS and Fauci do not hold a patent for remdesivir.
Remdesivir was invented by Gilead Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, following research that began in 2009 for treatment of hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus. Gilead received a patent for remdesivir in 2017 for treatment of filoviruses, such as Ebola. The company also received two other patents for remdesivir to treat filoviruses and coronaviruses in 2019.
Gilead has received an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for remdesivir as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and the company receives any profit from sales of the drug.
As part of the EUA granted by the FDA, Gilead has been donating remdesivir to the federal government to treat certain COVID-19 patients in U.S. hospitals. The company will donate 940,000 vials of remdesivir — enough to treat about 165,000 patients, an HHS spokesperson told the health news website STAT.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also was not involved in the invention or development of remdesivir, a spokesperson for the foundation confirmed to USA Today. Like Fauci, Gates has been the subject of online conspiracy theories.
In late April, Fauci spoke about a government study of remdesivir at a press conference with President Donald Trump, calling the results ""very important proof of concept"" and cause for optimism, but not a ""knockout.""
The social media post is correct that the success rate for remdesivir in the initial study was modest — and Fauci has been transparent about that. On NBC’s ""Today Show"" on April 30, he said that participants in the study who were given the drug showed a 31% ""better chance of recovering"" from COVID-19 than other participants in the study who were given a placebo.
On the other hand, the post’s claim about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine is inaccurate, as we’ve reported.
Despite Trump’s repeated promotion of hydroxychloroquine, and his announcement recently that he has been taking it, no studies have conclusively shown that it is effective in combating COVID-19, and certainly not 91% effective. The FDA has also warned against taking it outside of a hospital or clinical trial setting due to serious potential side effects, including heart problems.

		President Donald Trump has been holding daily press conferences to provide the latest information about the coronavirus from the federal government, but his rhetoric has sometimes been imprecise, misleading or outright incorrect.
Here are three recent examples:

News reports suggest China may have known about and concealed emerging information in the weeks after the novel coronavirus was detected, but Trump exaggerated how long when he said, ""I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.""
Trump said, ""We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers."" He didn’t mention that nearly half the nation’s workforce — those who work for companies employing 500 or more people — isn’t covered by the bill.
He also said, ""I don’t think I’ve ever said, ‘No,'"" to providing funds for other countries to fight diseases. But Trump has proposed global health budget cuts, including for programs that aim to prevent or respond to infectious diseases worldwide.

These statements were made in press conferences on March 20, 21 and 22.
How Long Did China Conceal News?
News reports suggest China may have known about and concealed emerging information in the weeks after the novel coronavirus was detected. But Trump went too far when he said, ""I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.""
The symptoms from the first cases of the virus did not emerge until early December, at the earliest, and China alerted the World Health Organization of mysterious pneumonia cases on Dec. 31. By early January, at the latest, the U.S. government was aware of the virus.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Trump’s right-hand man during the coronavirus crisis, said the president’s statement ""doesn’t comport [with the facts], because 2 or 3 months earlier would have been September.""
But the president has since repeated the claim.
In a press conference on March 21, Trump was asked when he first learned that the new coronavirus was going to be a problem. Trump said it was right around the time he imposed travel restrictions on China, which were announced on Jan. 31 and went into effect two days later.
Trump, March 21: Well, you know, when I learned, I started doing the closings. So, you know, probably around that time. We didn’t learn much. I think you’re going to ask a little bit about China responsibility. I do think that — again, I have great respect for China. I like China. I think the people of China are incredible. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi.
I wish they could have told us earlier about what was going on inside. We didn’t know about it until it started coming out publicly, but I wish they could have told us earlier about it because we could have come up with a solution.
Tony Fauci and all of the people — the talent that we have — would have loved to have had three or four months of additional time, if you knew that this was going to be happening. They didn’t have that time. They read about in the newspapers like everybody else. China was very secretive, okay? Very, very secretive. And that’s unfortunate. …
But I wish they were able to — I wish they would have told us earlier, Steve, that they were having a problem. Because they were having a big problem and they knew it, and I wish they could have given us an advanced warning. Because we could have done — we could have had a lot of things — as an example, some of the things that we’re talking about, where we order them as quickly as we can. If we had a two- or three-month difference in time, it would have been much better.
In an interview with Science magazine the following morning, Fauci said he told ""the appropriate people"" on the White House staff that Trump’s ""three to four month"" timeline was off.
Jon Cohen, Science magazine, March 22: What about the travel restrictions? Trump keeps saying that the travel ban for China, which began 2 February, had a big impact on slowing the spread of the virus to the United States and that he wishes China would have told us 3 to 4 months earlier and that they were ""very secretive."" [China did not immediately reveal the discovery of a new coronavirus in late December 2019, but by 10 January, Chinese researchers made the sequence of the virus public.] It just doesn’t comport with facts.
Fauci: I know, but what do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let’s get real, what do you want me to do?
Cohen: Most everyone thinks that you’re doing a remarkable job, but you’re standing there as the representative of truth and facts, but things are being said that aren’t true and aren’t factual.
Fauci: The way it happened is that after he made that statement [suggesting China could have revealed the discovery of a new coronavirus 3 to 4 months earlier], I told the appropriate people, it doesn’t comport, because 2 or 3 months earlier would have been September. The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he’s going to say, they will say, ‘By the way, Mr. President, be careful about this and don’t say that.’ But I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down. OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.
It didn’t get corrected the next time.
In a press conference later that day, Trump repeated the claim, saying, ""I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.""
Trump, March 22:  I wish — again, our relationship with China is a very good relationship. I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem. We didn’t know about it. They knew about it and they should have told us. We could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world. If you look at what’s happening in Italy and Spain and a lot of other countries, we could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world.
So when did China know about the virus, and when did the U.S. find out? The answer to both questions is difficult to pinpoint. But let’s start with China.
According to the World Health Organization, symptoms from the first cluster of confirmed cases emerged between Dec. 8 and Jan. 2. A study on the novel coronavirus published in The Lancet reported, ""The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019.""
On Dec. 31, the Chinese informed the World Health Organization’s China office ""of a pneumonia of unknown cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood market.""
The WHO says it then ""began monitoring the situation and requested further information on the laboratory tests performed and the different diagnoses considered.""
On Feb. 1, the Washington Post, citing ""official statements, leaked accounts from Chinese medical professionals, newly released scientific data and interviews with public health officials and infectious disease experts,"" documented efforts by the Chinese government to tamp down information about the virus ""during the critical period from mid-December to mid-January.""
According to the Post, ""Medical professionals who tried to sound an alarm were seized by police. Key state media omitted mention of the outbreak for weeks. ""
By Jan. 11, the Chinese had shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, which could then be used by other countries to develop diagnostic kits. Still, the Washington Post reported, ""Key information about who got sick and when was not released publicly until weeks later, scientists and researchers said.""
Trump said he didn’t learn that the virus would be a problem until ""probably around"" the time when he imposed travel restrictions on China. Those were announced on Jan. 31. But the government had growing concerns about the virus weeks before that.
In a press conference on March 20, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the U.S. was alerted to the problems in China ""by some discussions that Dr. [Robert] Redfield, the director of the CDC, had with Chinese colleagues on January 3rd. It’s since been known that there may have been cases in December, not that we were alerted in December.""
According to the Washington Post, ""U.S. intelligence agencies were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus while President Trump and lawmakers played down the threat and failed to take action that might have slowed the spread of the pathogen, according to U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting."" Those agencies warned that ""Chinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak.""
The WHO confirmed the first case outside of China on Jan. 13 in Thailand and confirmed three days later that the virus had spread to Japan. At around that time, the WHO warned that there could be a wider outbreak and recommended ""all countries to continue preparedness activities.""
In a CNBC interview on Jan. 22, Trump said of the virus, ""We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.""
On Jan. 24, Trump tweeted, ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!""
On Jan. 30, the WHO declared a global public health emergency, and Trump imposed travel restrictions a day later.
But even into late February, Trump continued to downplay the potential spread of the virus.
""So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck,"" Trump said at a White House briefing on Feb. 26. ""And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.""
Asked about his Jan. 24 tweet praising China for its ""efforts and transparency,"" Trump on March 21 said his comments about China’s efforts were true.
""China has worked very hard,"" Trump said, but he added that ""they weren’t transparent.""
""They were transparent at that time, but when we saw what happened, they could have been transparent much earlier than they were,"" Trump said. ""I just wish they could have told us earlier. They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could have said that.""
Trump has a point about Chinese officials not being transparent with information about the new coronavirus. But suggesting China could have alerted the U.S. and the world three or four months earlier does not comport with the timeline of events.
The first cases were not identified until December. Although it is unclear when exactly China may have pegged the sickness to the novel coronavirus, it was a matter of weeks between when those first cases were discovered and when the world knew about the virus. Those were critical weeks, but they weren’t months.
Sick Leave Legislation
At a March 20 press conference at the White House, Trump said, ""We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers."" But the assistance isn’t available for everyone. The legislation providing the leave excludes larger companies employing nearly half of the nation’s workforce.
Under a coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump on March 18, workers are to receive paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave. But companies with 500 or more employees are not covered. In addition, the labor secretary can exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees and health care providers.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 48% of American workers are employed by companies with 500 or more employees.
The legislation provides workers with two weeks of paid leave if they are sick or quarantined or taking care of sick relatives. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to those taking care of children whose schools are closed or whose child care facilities are unavailable. The bill also provides free coronavirus testing.
Most larger companies offer their employees paid sick leave, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, but many provide fewer than the 14 days necessary for a coronavirus quarantine. The average number of paid sick days for private companies with 500 workers or more was eight after one year on the job and 10 after 20 years, based on March 2018 data.
This was not the only time the Trump administration has cited the paid leave without mentioning that many aren’t eligible for it.
For example, on March 19, Trump said: ""We’re providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus and more help is on the way as we speak.""
That same day, Vice President Mike Pence said, ""Last night, as you heard, the president signed the Family First Coronavirus Response Act, which provides free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, family leave for caregivers, and food assistance for the needy, among a broad range of benefits.""
Funding to Fight Diseases
In a press briefing on March 22, Trump was asked whether the proposed coronavirus economic stimulus bill would include financial assistance for countries to fight global pandemics. In response, the president said ""no,"" but noted that ""we give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries"" to fight diseases. He added: ""I don’t think I’ve ever said, ‘No.’ I can’t.""
Trump hasn’t proposed eliminating all funding to combat global diseases, but he has proposed reduced funding. His most recent budget proposal for fiscal year 2021, for instance, includes funding cuts for such programs.
Reporter, March 22: Are you considering any financial support for them? Let me quote to you, two retired — a retired general and a retired admiral from the U.S. Global Health Coalition: ""No matter how successful we are in fighting the threat of COVID-19 pandemic at home, we’ll never stop it unless we’re also fighting it around the world.""
So, financially, is there anything in the stimulus bill? And then are you considering any financial support?
Trump: So — no, not in the stimulus bill, but we are very much — I mean, we give away billions of dollars for, as an example, AIDS in Africa. We’re still fighting that battle. It’s a tremendous battle. …
But we’re spending a lot of money with other countries. If you look at the aid that we give to other countries, we give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries. And a lot of times, I say, ""You know, we could save a lot of money. We shouldn’t."" And then, they come in. I say, ""What’s it used for?"" ""It’s used to fight malaria in countries that are very poor. It’s used to fight AIDS in Africa. It’s used to fight many other things."" Many other things. And I don’t think I’ve ever said, ""No."" I can’t. It’s just so terrible.
According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Trump’s most recent budget proposal requests less funding to fight diseases globally than what has been appropriated by Congress in previous years.
For example, Trump requested $3.76 billion for global HIV/AIDS programs, which is $1.59 billion less than what Congress approved in fiscal 2020 and would be the lowest amount of funding since 2007.
The president also requested $283.2 million for tuberculosis programs, or $37.6 million less than what Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2020, and $905.2 million for malaria programs, which would be a reduction of $93.9 million from the funding for the current fiscal cycle. 
Plus, Trump proposed cutting U.S. funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a publicly and privately funded international organization, by $902 million — from the $1.56 billion appropriated in FY 2020 to $658 million proposed in the president’s FY 2021 budget.
Trump’s budget would also reduce funding for neglected tropical diseases to $75 million, down more than $27 million from the enacted amount of $102.5 million for 2020. The World Health Organization says NTDs ""are a diverse group of communicable diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions in 149 countries and affect more than one billion people, costing developing economies billions of dollars every year.""
And, KFF says, compared with 2020, Trump’s budget request seeks almost $119 million less in 2021 for ""other"" services, which ""includes funding for WHO and PAHO [Pan American Health Organization]; global parasitic diseases at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]; the Fogarty International Center at NIH [National Institutes of Health]; as well as the Emergency Reserve Fund, which was created in the FY17 Omnibus bill to respond to contagious infectious disease outbreaks, and would be made available if there is an ‘emerging health threat that poses severe threats to human health.’""
In fact, according to KFF’s analysis, Trump’s request of $557 million for global health security — which would be an $11 million increase from 2020 — is the only global health program area that would see an increase under Trump’s desired budget for fiscal 2021. With its global health security initiatives, including its work as part of the Global Health Security Agenda, the U.S. aims to help other countries prepare to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats worldwide.
Overall, though, ""The FY 2021 President’s budget request proposes to reduce global health funding to $7.7 billion, its lowest level since FY 2008,"" KFF said. And Trump has consistently sought cuts to the global health budget since he has been in office, KFF has found.
In addition to programs to fight diseases, the global health category also includes efforts to improve global nutrition and family planning and reproductive health.
As we’ve explained before, a president’s budget request is more a symbolic statement of priorities than anything Congress would enact. A March 2019 Congressional Research Service report details how Congress has repeatedly appropriated more money for certain global health programs than Trump has requested in his budgets.
But the president’s claim that he doesn’t think he has said ""no"" to providing funds to other countries to fight diseases ignores his budget proposals.

Livestock and poultry are not being vaccinated against COVID-19. But a meme is spreading the falsehood that those who eat meat from vaccinated animals will get ""VAXXED"" by consuming the meat. That simply isn’t possible, according to immunologists.

              How effective are the vaccines?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

Full Story
We’ve already explained why some earlier claims about COVID-19 vaccine transfer were false. But a new claim has emerged on Instagram suggesting that eating meat from animals vaccinated against COVID-19 could transfer the inoculation.
The meme was first shared by an account that is selling a book titled ""Detoxing The Rona Shot,"" which is based on the false claim that the COVID-19 vaccines ""put nano magnetic gene computers in everyone."" We’ve already addressed several other claims about microchips in the vaccines.
The recent meme claims, ""IF YOU ARE EATING FARM RAISED MEAT THE ANIMALS ARE BEING VAXXED SO U R VAXXED."" The account that posted it wrote in the comments, ""In their mind they are protecting animals from a deadly disease. Animals get the alleged covid too. Vaccinating them is just protection.""
First of all, livestock isn’t being vaccinated against COVID-19.
""It’s simply not happening,"" Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, said in a phone interview. He knew of no countries that were vaccinating livestock for COVID-19.
In the U.S., there are no COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in livestock and there are no federal recommendations that livestock should be vaccinated against COVID-19, Lyndsay Cole, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, told us in an email.
APHIS regulates veterinary vaccines in the U.S., and it put out a call in November for COVID-19 vaccines that could be used in mink. Outbreaks of the disease on mink farms had been reported in multiple countries last year, including the U.S., which caused concern since mink could act as a reservoir for the virus to mutate and then be passed back to humans as a new variant.
In contrast to mink, which the World Organisation for Animal Health lists as highly susceptible to the virus that causes COVID-19, two of the major types of livestock in the U.S. — cattle and hogs — are listed as having ""extremely low"" susceptibility. Poultry is listed as having no susceptibility.
The virus’ effect on animals continues to be studied, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently says that the risk of spread from most animals is low.
Following APHIS’ request in November, at least two U.S. companies — Zoetis and Medgene Labs — began developing vaccines that could be used in mink. Zoetis announced on July 2 that its vaccine had been authorized for experimental use on a case-by-case basis for various animals in some zoos and sanctuaries. The vaccine has not been fully licensed and is not commercially available, company spokeswoman Christina Lood told us in a phone interview.
Medgene is still in the development phase of its vaccine, company spokesman Jason Melby told us in a phone interview.
Both companies are pursuing a subunit type of vaccine, Lood and Melby said. That means that the vaccines are introducing a small, inactive piece of the virus that causes COVID-19 in order to trigger an immune response in the recipient.
Russia also has reportedly developed a COVID-19 vaccine for animals, which was tested on dogs, cats, foxes and mink.
It’s also worth noting that, according to a list of COVID-19 policies on the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations website, no countries have implemented programs to vaccinate livestock against COVID-19.
Vaccines Aren’t Transferred Through Meat
Beyond the fact that livestock and poultry aren’t getting the COVID-19 vaccine, experts we spoke to said that it wouldn’t be possible for the vaccine to be transmitted through consumption of meat, anyway.
""These animals have always been given a lot of vaccines,"" Kuchipudi said, and none of them pass on to those who eat the resulting meat. ""That’s not how they transfer,"" he said.
That would be true for subunit vaccines, like the ones Zoetis and Medgene are developing, and for the mRNA vaccines that account for the majority of shots administered to people in the U.S., he said.
The meme doesn’t specify which type of vaccine is supposedly being administered to livestock.
""It just simply can’t happen,"" John Wherry, chair of the department of systems pharmacology and translational therapeutics and director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology at the Perelman School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. ""It doesn’t work that way.""
Referring to the messenger RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, Wherry explained that once the mRNA gets into a cell, it doesn’t propagate any further — meaning it doesn’t spread from one cell to another.
And as we’ve explained before, the mRNA passes on instructions to make antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19, then is quickly broken down and leaves the body.
""Even if you ate"" the vaccine, Wherry said, it wouldn’t work.
It would be doubly impossible to get the vaccine from meat, he said, since cooking it would inactivate the RNA.
Gary Whittaker, professor of virology at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, agreed. He told us in an email that, in his view, it would be impossible for an mRNA vaccine to be transmitted through meat consumption.
""The RNA is just too unstable to survive – hence the need for all the freezers for the vaccine,"" he wrote.
Addressing how other types of vaccines may behave if they were given to livestock, Whittaker wrote, ""An adenovirus-vaccine (J+J/AstraZeneca) would be more stable, but still extremely unlikely to survive processing. A live attenuated-vaccine (not currently used) could theoretically survive, at least until the meat is cooked – but in this case there are way bigger risks associated with eating raw meat!""
Although COVID-19 vaccines aren’t being given to livestock, as Penn State’s Kuchipudi said, a number of vaccines are commonly given to poultry and livestock for other viruses. And there are already rules in place for how much time must pass between when a vaccine is given and when an animal is slaughtered, often referred to as the withdrawal time.
This withdrawal period ""ensures the end product is safe for consumption and no medication would be present in the beef,"" the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association explained in a Q&A at the beginning of the pandemic.
Simply put, the claim that vaccines can be transferred by eating meat ""doesn’t make any scientific sense,"" Wherry said.

		In a hyped press briefing the eve of the Republican National Convention, President Donald Trump falsely said that convalescent plasma had been ""proven to reduce mortality by 35%,"" even though the therapy has not yet been shown to be effective for COVID-19.
Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn also mischaracterized the data, inaccurately saying that a relative mortality decrease of 35% between those given high- versus low-concentration plasma meant that administering plasma would save 35 out 100 people sickened with COVID-19. That’s not right, and exaggerates the observed effect.
The administration’s inaccurate and imprecise summary of the existing data on convalescent plasma occurred in a Sunday night press briefing that Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany billed as revealing ""a major therapeutic breakthrough"" for the coronavirus.
The press conference was held one day after Trump alleged, baselessly, that the ""deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA"" was making it hard for companies to test COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics in an effort to delay results until after the Nov. 3 election. There is no evidence for such a claim. 
Convalescent plasma, which dates back to the 1918 influenza pandemic, refers to isolating the liquid portion of blood from patients who have recovered from COVID-19, which may contain antibodies that could help sick patients better fight off the virus.
In announcing that the FDA was issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 — a decision that days before, the New York Times reported had been put on hold after other federal health officials thought the data was too weak — Trump claimed that the therapy had ""an incredible rate of success"" and that a Mayo Clinic study had ""proven"" that it worked. 
Trump, Aug. 23: We’ve provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35%. …The FDA, MIT, Harvard and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease. Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective.
In fact, the FDA did not determine that convalescent plasma is ""safe and very effective,"" as few randomized controlled trials exist, making its true efficacy unknown. Instead, the agency decided that the totality of the evidence supports the idea that plasma ""may be effective in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"" and that it is reasonable to think that the potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.
Those risks include ""allergic reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and transfusion associated lung injury, as well as the potential for transfusion-transmitted infections,"" the FDA said in a press release announcing the EUA.
The FDA’s clinical memorandum emphasizes that additional research is still needed, writing, ""Adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of [COVID-19 convalescent plasma] efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes and appropriate patient populations for its use."" 
The memo further explains that there are public results for only two randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 — one in Wuhan, China, and another in the Netherlands. Neither identified a statistically significant clinical improvement, although both trials were small and terminated early, and therefore may have missed the opportunity to detect a meaningful clinical benefit.
Previously, patients could obtain convalescent plasma through one of three pathways, including the expanded access program, which is what led to the Mayo Clinic study. Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us that with the EUA, hospitalized patients can now receive plasma outside of those programs — ""just like any other prescription drug, so long as it is provided within the terms of the EUA.""
Initially in the briefing, Hahn was more circumspect in his description of the data on convalescent plasma, saying that agency scientists concluded that ""COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy.""
But in explaining the Mayo Clinic results, he neglected to mention that the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was not a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment to a placebo — and that the so-called 35% mortality benefit was in a subset of patients, comparing those who received plasma with a high concentration of antibodies to those who received a low concentration.
""In the optimal treatment — the optimal patients … treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers,"" Hahn said, referring to the concentration of antibodies in the plasma, ""there was a 35% improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.""
He then proceeded to incorrectly cast the finding as an absolute mortality benefit.
""So let me just put this in perspective. Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35% improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit,"" Hahn continued. ""What that means is — and if the data continue to pan out — 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.""
When pressed by a reporter and asked directly whether he was saying convalescent plasma was a promising treatment or had been shown to be effective, Hahn dodged the question — and let the misleading interpretation of the study stand.
""So I would say that a 35 — if you’re one of those 35 out of 100 people who these data suggest or show survive as a result of it,"" he said, ""this is pretty significant for that person and their family.""
As we’ll explain, the 35% figure is a relative number, reflecting how much better patients who were given high titer plasma fared compared with those given low titer plasma. It does not mean that if the results hold that 35 people out of 100 would be saved by plasma. That would be an absolute mortality benefit, or the proportion of patients who avoid death because of the therapy.
In this case, the study did not test plasma against a placebo, so it cannot provide that information, although the absolute mortality reduction of giving concentrated plasma rather than low-concentration plasma, at least as reported in the preprint, is just 4.8% — meaning that fewer than five extra patients in 100 would survive as a result.
But even more critically, that particular result was drawn from a subset of participants and does not come from a randomized controlled trial, so it’s not definitive — and doesn’t settle the question of whether convalescent plasma is effective for COVID-19.
Hahn has since apologized for his flawed description of the Mayo Clinic results.
""I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma,"" he said in an Aug. 24 tweet. ""The criticism is entirely justified.  What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.""
And in an Aug. 25 interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" Hahn said, ""I personally could have done a better job and should have done a better job at that press conference explaining what the data show regarding convalescent plasma.""
Mayo Clinic Study
The Mayo Clinic study reports the results of more than 35,000 patients in the U.S.’s Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma. Rather than assigning people to either receive plasma or not, as would happen in a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the investigators followed the outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were given plasma at nearly 2,000 sites across the country. 
To get a sense of whether the treatment worked, researchers then analyzed the data to see whether patients were less likely to die if they received the plasma earlier in their disease course, or, in a subset of patients for whom their plasma was evaluated for antibodies, whether those who got plasma that was rich in antibodies survived better than those who received less concentrated plasma.
Overall, the data point to convalescent plasma being beneficial for COVID-19. According to the preprint, 8.7% of patients who received plasma within three days of diagnosis died within seven days, versus 11.9% of those who got it after four days or more. Similarly, the seven-day mortality rate was 8.9% for those who received the most concentrated plasma, compared with 13.7% for those who received the least concentrated plasma. That’s an absolute risk reduction of 4.8% and a 35% reduction in the relative mortality.
Still, as a Johns Hopkins University review notes, because of the study design, it’s not possible to tell from this work whether or not convalescent plasma is effective for COVID-19. 
""[T]he cause of these differences in mortality may not be due to plasma therapy as the patients treated changed over time – were younger, healthier, less likely to have complications, and more likely to receive remdesivir later in the study – and the titer of antibodies transfused increased and the time to treatment also decreased over time,"" the review reads. ""This study highlights the need for randomized controlled studies to determine if there is a benefit for convalescent plasma for COVID-19.""
Mysterious 35% Relative Mortality Reduction
Trump and Hahn have emphasized the 35% mortality reduction from the Mayo Clinic study, but it’s worth noting that it’s based on a subset of patients. And it’s not even entirely clear which data produced the statistic.
As noted above, there is a 35% crude relative mortality reduction reported in the preprint at seven days for those who received high-concentration plasma versus low-concentration plasma. This number is based on 1,076 patients who received plasma that had been measured for antibody titers and met the cutoff parameters (see table 1).
But the preprint also shows a 35% relative decrease in mortality for high versus low concentration plasma at day seven when adjusted for potential confounding factors using a pooled relative risk estimate. That number is based on a total of 1,058 patients, approximately a third of whom were on a ventilator and a fifth of whom had ""many"" severe risk factors (see figure 3).
Previously, however, the FDA told the New York Times that the 35% statistic was based on other data from the Mayo Clinic study that the agency included in its EUA application — specifically a survival graph at 30 days for a subset of fewer than 1,300 patients who were younger than 80, were not on a ventilator and had received plasma within three days (see figure 3 on page 12).
Although the 35% is never written anywhere in the EUA application — and cannot be directly calculated because no exact numbers are provided — the Times estimated a 76% survival probability for patients receiving high-concentration plasma and a 63% survival probability for patients receiving low-concentration plasma from the graph, which works out to a 35% relative decrease in mortality.
Notably, Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins University, who was one of the senior authors of the Mayo Clinic study, told the New York Times that he didn’t know where the 35% came from.
When we asked the FDA which specific data were used to make the 35% claim, the agency pointed us to Hahn’s ""CBS This Morning"" interview and promised to provide further information ""when it is available."" We will update the story if we hear back. At this point, however, it remains unclear which information was used to generate the administration’s primary talking point.
Hahn’s Error
Regardless of the exact source, Hahn’s presentation of a 35% absolute mortality reduction, rather than a relative one, is incorrect. 
While this might seem to be a small error, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, told us that it wasn’t.
""THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE which is very basic,"" he said in an email. ""I want to give Dr. Steve Hahn the benefit of the doubt that he was speaking extemporaneously and flubbed something,"" he added, but the difference in this case is ""huge."" 
Indeed, if it is based on the preprint figure, that would mean Hahn exaggerated the effect of convalescent plasma sevenfold.
Boulware said he suspected that compared to no plasma, patients getting convalescent plasma probably are better off — but this remains an unanswered question. So are other critical questions, such as which patients benefit, which is especially important to know in deciding how to allocate a limited supply.
The Expanded Access Program, Boulware said, ""was meant to be a short term bridge back in April. Yet tens of thousands of patients later, we don’t know what the benefit of plasma is.""
As for the EUA, Boulware said it ""may"" be warranted, but the hype beforehand was not — and that Hahn’s portrayal of a 35% absolute reduction in mortality was ""deceptively misleading.""
While the administration claims the EUA will expand access of convalescent plasma, Boulware said it changes little other than the paperwork. ""Plasma remains a scarce resource,"" he said. ""We use all the plasma locally that is available.""
More worryingly, Boulware thinks the EUA will make completing the necessary clinical trials more difficult to do. ""People will want plasma which ‘saves 35% of people’s lives,’"" he said, ""and not enroll in randomized trials"" in which patients may not be assigned to get the treatment. 
For his part, Casadevall, a senior author of the Mayo Clinic study, supports the EUA and believes it will help improve COVID-19 health inequities. 
""Plasma was already available in well resourced hospitals but understaffed hospitals caring for [underserved] populations struggled with the paperwork under the prior regs,"" he said in an Aug. 24 tweet. ""EUA makes usage easier.""
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the previous FDA commissioner under Trump, didn’t doubt that the EUA decision was science-based, but echoed the call for randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma.
""Plasma may provide a benefit, and it could be meaningful for certain patients, but we need more evidence to prove it,"" he said in a tweet. ""The data FDA had supports an authorization for emergency use, where the standard is ‘may be effective’ but we need better studies to confirm preliminary findings.""
After reviewing the published and unpublished evidence that underpinned the FDA’s EUA decision, the National Institute of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued a statement on Sept. 1 emphasizing the lack of available evidence on convalescent plasma.
""There are currently no data from well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,"" the statement reads, adding that the FDA’s analysis of a subset of patients from the Mayo Clinic found no overall benefit in survival at seven days among those given high- versus low-concentration plasma.
Rather, an effect was found only in patients who were not intubated, with 11% of patients given high-concentration plasma dying within a week compared with 14% of patients given low-concentration plasma — a 21% decrease in relative mortality.
""Although these data suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody titers may be beneficial in nonintubated patients, uncertainty remains about the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma due to the lack of a randomized control group and possible confounding,"" the statement said. ""Additionally, antibody levels in currently available COVID-19 convalescent plasma are highly variable, and assays to determine the effective antibody titers remain limited.""
The panel concluded that for now, there are ""insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19.""
Update, Aug. 27: We added more information about how the EUA for COVID-19 convalescent plasma changes how patients can access the therapy.
Update, Sept. 3: We added the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s statement about the FDA’s EUA for convalescent plasma.

		At a May 12 Senate committee hearing on COVID-19, while questioning National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, ""We are right now at … 25,000 new infections a day and 2,000 deaths a day.""
""Right,"" Fauci replied.
Later in the day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Warren for using what she called ""some funny numbers.""
""Elizabeth Warren erroneously said there were 25,000 new cases today,"" McEnany said at a press conference. ""In fact, there were less than 20,000. Sen. Warren said there were 2,000 deaths. In fact, there have been less than 1,000.""
McEnany said she had discussed the statistics with Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus task force response coordinator, ""and she helped me to correct those numbers, which I’d like to correct here. Because I think it’s unfair to the American people to give inflated case numbers and mortality numbers, because it leads to those same Americans making the decision to not get a mammogram, to not have the cancer screenings they need.""
Warren’s office declined to comment on the issue.
The disparity is largely a matter of semantics. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said ""new infections a day,"" suggesting totals over a period of time. She used that phrase several times at the hearing. McEnany said ""today,"" which is much more limited, and ""today,"" of course, was far from over when Warren was questioning Fauci in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing.
The argument comes as President Donald Trump has encouraged governors to reopen their states and some Democrats have questioned whether it’s too soon to do so. In fact, Warren cited the numbers as she pressed Fauci on whether or not the novel coronavirus had been ""contained"" and whether the U.S. had enough ""robust countermeasures"" in place.
As for the daily number of new cases, the rolling three-day average on May 11, the day before Warren asked her question, was 24,276, according to Our World in Data. That’s pretty close to 25,000. On May 10, it was 26,979. In fact, the rolling three-day average was over 25,000 throughout the earlier part of the month except for May 6 and 7, when it was above 23,000. The total was above 30,000 on May 2 and 3.
According to the COVID Tracking Project, there were 17,605 new cases on May 11. But the number of new cases was above 25,000 from May 7 through 9 and from April 28 through May 3, twice surpassing 30,000.

The three-day rolling average for the daily death toll was 1,286 on May 11, according to Our World in Data. But as recently as May 9, just three days before the hearing, that average was above 2,000 — 2,034 — and on May 8 it was 2,245. It was as low as 1,289 on May 5, but it was above 2,000 from April 30 through May 2.
According to the COVID Tracking Project, there were 837 deaths on May 11. There also were fewer than a thousand the day before that. The numbers fluctuated earlier in the month, twice surpassing 2,500, nearing 2,000 on another occasion and falling to 912 on May 3.

So, the numbers vary by day, making any figures about ""today"" — McEnany’s word, not Warren’s — different from a broader look at a period of time.

      Trump Falsely Distorts New York Times COVID-19 Science Story

		In a weekend tweet, President Donald Trump erroneously described a New York Times article, falsely stating that it said the coronavirus originated in Europe and suggesting that it had no named sources. 
The story, which reported on new genomic analyses of some of the first coronavirus cases in the New York area, made no such claim — and quoted no fewer than seven scientists by name.
""So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China,"" Trump said in an April 11 tweet, in an apparent reference to an April 8 story published in the science section of the paper. ""This is a first!""
The president then speculated that the story had been written to curry favor with China, which announced in mid-March that it would expel American journalists with three news outlets, including the Times. ""I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one?"" the president asked. ""Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!""
Contrary to Trump’s assertions, the Times’ story never said that the coronavirus originated in Europe. Instead, the article details research findings that suggest a majority of the first cases of the coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, in New York City resulted from travelers from Europe. 
""New research indicates that the coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case,"" the story begins, ""and that travelers brought in the virus mainly from Europe, not Asia.""
That doesn’t mean the virus started in Europe, only that the primary way the virus appears to have landed in the Big Apple was via Europe.
The story’s author, science journalist Carl Zimmer, explained as much in an April 11 Twitter thread correcting the president. ""Scientists wanted to know how the virus reached the city. Studying the virus’s genes, they found the answer: mostly from Europe,"" he wrote. ""The virus did not originate in Europe, but it got to New York through Europe.""
Similarly, the answer to Trump’s insinuating question about whether there are any named sources — which would be apparent to anyone reading the article — is an emphatic yes. More than half a dozen scientists comment on the record, and there are no anonymous sources.
Or, as Zimmer put it, ""Um, they’re ALL named in the article. See for yourself.""
Zimmer’s article, ""Most New York Coronavirus Cases Came From Europe, Genomes Show,"" describes preliminary results from two hospital systems in the city that sequenced viral genomes isolated from COVID-19 patients. Because the virus is constantly mutating as it replicates, slight changes in the genomes can be used to infer where and how long those viruses were recently circulating — and help trace the spread of the virus across the globe.
The Mount Sinai Health System, for example, collected samples from 84 patients over the first few weeks of March, just after the first documented COVID-19 case in New York. The researchers’ analysis, which has yet to be peer reviewed, concluded that while the virus entered the city on multiple occasions from different places, a large proportion of the genomes are most similar to those from Europe. The results were posted on the preprint server medRxiv on April 11.
Another research group at NYU Grossman School of Medicine came to a similar conclusion, noting in an April 9 press release that ""most local viral samples indicate that they originated in Europe.""
Again, this does not mean the novel coronavirus started in Europe, but that many New York cases stem from viruses that circulated in Europe, after the virus made its way out of China.
Zimmer interviewed two authors of the Mount Sinai report and the lead researcher of the NYU team; he also consulted four additional scientists.
The fact that the virus began infecting people in Asia is perhaps most clear from the family tree-type visualizations from Nextstrain, a project tracking the virus’ evolution using sequences scientists around the world — including the two New York hospital systems — uploaded to a database.
As Zimmer pointed out in his story, ""The deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China.""
For Trump, the New York City results also have implications for his repeated claim that U.S. travel restrictions have been lifesaving. 
The findings indicate that the virus, which goes by the name SARS-CoV-2, was being passed around for weeks prior to the first confirmed case in the city, which was announced on March 1. That suggests that the president’s travel restrictions, which applied to China on Feb. 2, Iran on March 2 and the bulk of Europe on March 13, had little effect on the outbreak in New York City, which has been the largest in the country.
""Our data provide insight into the limited efficacy of travel restrictions for preventing spread of SARS-CoV2 infections in NYC,"" the Mount Sinai preprint reads, ""and point to the increased risk of community driven transmission within the larger metropolitan area."" 
We don’t know if Trump misunderstood the Times’ story or even if he read it or read it in full; we did not hear back from the White House when asked for comment. But his remarks about the article are inaccurate.
Editor’s Note: The author was previously a student in a science writing course taught by Carl Zimmer.

      Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?

		7.4KPresident Donald Trump suggested that the new coronavirus would ""go away"" in April, as temperatures warm. While some viruses are seasonal, it’s not yet clear if the new virus will follow the same pattern — and experts caution against banking on the weather to resolve the outbreak.
The outbreak of a respiratory illness now known as coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. According to the World Health Organization, as of Feb. 13, the virus has infected more than 46,000 people and killed at least 1,116.
Some scientists and others have speculated that if the new coronavirus is similar to influenza and some other viruses, it could dissipate once temperatures rise and humidity increases. But right now, that’s an unknown, and whether the virus will decline by April may also hinge on other factors, including the degree of spread and the effectiveness of containment efforts.
""It’s possible, but it is wishful thinking, by analogy with flu and other winter respiratory viruses,"" Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us of an April timeframe. ""I’d say wait until April, we’ll know then if it’s true."" In the meantime, he recommended continuing to attempt to control the virus, and not being ""lulled by hopeful, but quite possibly wrong analogies.""
The president first referenced the weather potentially helping with the outbreak in an early morning tweet on Feb. 7, when he said he had just spoken on the phone with President Xi Jinping of China. 
""Nothing is easy,"" Trump said, but Xi ""will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.""
Several days later, in a White House meeting with state governors, he repeated the idea and was more specific on the outbreak’s timeline.
Trump, Feb. 10: Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.
At the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 12 cases in the U.S., although the agency announced an additional case in California that day. As of Feb. 13, the tally had risen to a total of 15.
Later in his remarks to the governors, Trump praised China for ""doing a good job"" with the outbreak, and again mentioned his call with the Chinese leader. 
""I had a long talk with President Xi — for the people in this room — two nights ago, and he feels very confident,"" Trump said. ""He feels very confident. And he feels that, again, as I mentioned, by April or during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus.""
Trump also said similar things at his rally in New Hampshire that evening.
Trump, Feb. 10: ""And by the way, the virus. … It looks like by April, you know in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away — I hope that’s true. But we’re doing great in our country. China, I spoke with President Xi, and they’re working very, very hard. And I think it’s going to all work out fine. Rough stuff, I tell you, rough, rough stuff. But I think it’s going to work out good. We only have 11 cases, and they’re all getting better.
There is a scientific basis for some of Trump’s comments, as many respiratory viruses ebb in spring and summer, possibly because the warmer, wetter conditions hamper viral spread. But it’s unknown if that applies to the new coronavirus — and it wouldn’t be that the virus ""miraculously goes away.""
Seasonality of Some Viruses
Numerous human viruses, including influenza and some other coronaviruses (there are several), are seasonal, typically striking in the cooler months, with cases declining as summer nears. Scientists aren’t exactly sure why this happens, but one of the prevailing theories is that it’s because of the weather. 
""We know that some respiratory viruses in the air or on surfaces lose their ability to infect cells under warmer and moderately humid conditions,"" Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, said in an email. 
Marr, who has studied viral survival under different environmental conditions, said the mechanism for this is unknown — and could involve various parts of the virus, including the viral envelope, surface proteins or genome — but there appears to be something about the colder, drier air that allows some viruses to better survive and spread. ""Once the weather warms up, conditions are not as favorable for virus survival,"" she said.
Several studies have found that absolute humidity in particular may be especially important in driving some of these effects. Absolute humidity, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch explained, is essentially the amount of moisture in the air. ""This is always low when it’s cold because cold air can’t hold much water or it will start to rain,"" he said in an email.
Lipsitch is a co-author on a paper that found in models of seasonal flu, outbreaks in temperate regions tend to start once absolute humidity levels fall.
Beyond direct interactions between the environment and the virus, seasonality of certain viruses could also be due to social factors, such as the school calendar or indoor crowding, as well as changes in a person’s immune system.
Experiments in mice, for instance, have shown that inhalation of dry air may weaken the immune response against influenza infection. Some scientists have also suspected that in the winter, less sun exposure could lead to lower vitamin D levels, which could then potentially reduce the body’s ability to fight off a virus.
Marr said there wasn’t yet a consensus among scientists about what leads some viruses to be seasonal — and it could be a mix of factors. ""It could be due to differences in virus survival in air and on surfaces and/or it could be due to seasonal changes in people’s immune function,"" she said. ""This is an area of active research.""
David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, agreed, noting that the drivers of viral seasonality are ""often hard to identify with certainty as so many environmental and behavioral factors change in tandem.""
Unknown If New Virus Is Seasonal
Whether the new virus will be seasonal — and the outbreak improved by shifting weather — is unknown.
Looking back to 2003’s outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, Lipsitch said weather ""may have helped a little,"" but that the outbreak subsided because of ""very intensive control efforts based on quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases."" The new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus, sharing approximately 80% of its genome, which is reflected in its new name, SARS-CoV-2.
Lipsitch added that his ongoing analyses ""do seem to show a little less transmission in more summery conditions"" for the new coronavirus and some other human coronaviruses responsible for common colds. But, he said, ""that is not likely to be enough"" to make the new virus ""‘go away’ on its own.""
Morse, the Columbia epidemiologist, noted that in Canada, one SARS outbreak was controlled by mid-April, but another peaked in late May. Another coronavirus, the one responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, thrives in high-temperature Gulf countries, suggesting it’s not particularly susceptible to environmental conditions. But outbreaks of both viruses were driven by health care transmissions, Morse said, which so far does not appear to be the case with the new virus.
""We don’t know if this virus will be seasonal, because we haven’t had previous experience with this virus, and SARS and MERS are not necessarily good analogies,"" he said in an email. ""It’s possible it will be seasonal, but it’s too early to tell, so it’s just speculation.""
While the new virus could behave similarly to flu, several epidemiologists noted that there are additional reasons not to assume that will be the case.
For one, even though flu generally subsides in temperate regions when summer rolls around, there are instances in which flu has not always obeyed its own calendar.
""A number of flu pandemics have come in late spring or summer,"" Morse said, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu and the 1957 flu in the U.S.
Influenza viruses, too, do not show typical seasonal patterns in tropical areas, and the new coronavirus has already landed in those parts of the world.
The new coronavirus ""seems to circulate quite nicely in tropical areas,"" such as Singapore, Fisman said in an email, ""so it seems to me unlikely that it would stop circulating simply because of warmer weather.""
Lipsitch added that if temperature or humidity are important factors for this new virus, air conditioning could undermine some of the potential benefit hot and humid climates bring.
""An April end to the outbreak would be truly astonishing,"" Lipsitch said. ""I think it will just be getting under way in much of the world.""
Marr, who thinks it’s ""likely"" the outbreak will ""die down in the spring,"" nevertheless was wary of implying that the world should rely on a shift in weather to help control the virus. ""Both containment efforts and a change in weather could help slow the outbreak,"" she said.
Thus, while the president’s assertions are possible, and guided by some scientific thinking, they are hardly a given.
Indeed, as Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Feb. 12 telebriefing, ""I would caution overinterpreting"" the idea that warmer weather would ""weaken"" the virus. Noting that the agency has had less than six weeks of experience with the outbreak, she said, ""I’m happy to hope that it goes down as the weather warms up, but I think it’s premature to assume that. And we’re certainly not using that to sit back and expect it to go away.""

		SciCheck Digest
A video falsely claims that people receiving authorized COVID-19 vaccines are taking part in a deadly clinical trial and that those administering the doses are war criminals under the Nuremberg Code. That’s bogus. People getting the vaccines, which have been shown to be safe and effective, consent to receive them and aren’t participating in research.

              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

              Hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain — or no side effects at all. As the CDC has said, these vaccines ""have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.""
A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated.
As of Jan. 18, there have been 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those who develop anaphylaxis are usually given epinephrine, the drug found in EpiPens. None of these reactions has led to death. On Feb. 26, Johnson & Johnson said it had received a report of one anaphylactic reaction in South Africa.
To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn’t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, primarily in women ages 18 to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.
As of July 12, the syndrome has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine. There have been three deaths linked to the condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
In April, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use"" of the vaccine to investigate six reports of the syndrome out of more than 6.8 million immunizations. After a review, which turned up nine more cases, the CDC and FDA determined that the benefits still outweigh the risks and that the pause should be lifted. A warning was nevertheless added to the vaccine’s fact sheet and the CDC has said that women younger than 50 years old ""especially should be aware"" of the condition and that ""that there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen."" The condition is still rare among the highest-risk group, occurring in around 7 of every million vaccinated adult women below the age of 50.
On July 13, the FDA added warnings to fact sheets on the J&J vaccine about an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
The agency said the chance of developing the syndrome is ""very low"" but advised J&J vaccine recipients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms including weakness or tingling, particularly in the legs or arms; difficulty walking or with facial movement; double vision; or bladder control or bowel function issues.
The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases, with most people reporting symptoms within 42 days of vaccination. One death was reported, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine. The FDA said that each year 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome and most recover fully.
There is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men. In late June, after a review of safety monitoring data, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and the two conditions in teens and young adults.
As of July 12, the agency says there have been 1,047 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years old or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which are through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, are with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and are more common among males and after the second dose.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, the committee said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.""

Full Story
A popular video from a British conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist makes a slew of false claims about government-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, including the incorrect notion that they are ""experimental"" and that the clinicians administering them are violating the Nuremberg Code.
That’s wrong on both counts. While phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccines are continuing as planned to collect additional data, that doesn’t mean the immunizations are experimental or that people who are now getting vaccinated are participating in a trial.
Moreover, nothing about the Nuremberg Code applies to the situation, as people getting the vaccines are doing so as part of their own medical care, not research. They also consent to receive the jabs and information about the vaccines is widely available.
The video also baselessly claims that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and tantamount to a ""global genocide,"" citing deaths that have not been proven to be from vaccines.
The claims are made in a 15-minute video by Dr. Vernon Coleman, a former general practitioner in the U.K. who is no longer registered to practice medicine. Coleman has a history of peddling discredited medical information and has argued that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax and that AIDS does not exist.
The video has been shared on multiple Facebook pages and appears on various websites, including a site run by Charlie Ward, a man who has previously made false claims about COVID-19 vaccines.
The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for use during the pandemic: Oxford University and AstraZeneca’s viral vectored vaccine, Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine and Moderna’s mRNA vaccine. The U.S.’s Food and Drug Administration has authorized the latter two for emergency use. (See SciCheck’s guides to those here and here.)
False Claims About Human Experimentation & War Crimes
In the video, Coleman claims the COVID-19 vaccine is ""experimental"" and says because the vaccine trials are still ongoing, ""Everyone having the vaccine is therefore taking part in an experiment.""
He then goes on to claim that people giving the vaccines are legally war criminals under the Nuremberg Code. 
""The Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation written in 1947 … stated that explicit, voluntary consent from patients is required for human experimentation,"" he says. ""That means that patients must be told that they’re taking part in a trial and they must be warned of all the possible adverse events. That’s what informed consent means. … And so legally, all those people giving vaccinations are war criminals.""
""Everyone giving the COVID-19 vaccines without explaining that … it’s an experiment and without listing all the possible adverse events is a war criminal,"" he continues. ""That’s not rhetoric. It’s not opinion. It’s fact.""
Except that it’s not fact. People receiving the authorized vaccines are not participating in clinical trials. And because it’s not research, the Nuremberg Code has no bearing on anything — even though ethically, everything is still above board. No one is in danger of being a war criminal.
Holly Fernandez Lynch, an assistant professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine told us the claims were ""ridiculous."" 
The Nuremberg Code, as we’ve explained before, is a code of research ethics created in the wake of the Nazis’ horrific treatment of human subjects in experiments during the Holocaust. One of its primary principles is that individuals participating in research should do so voluntarily and with adequate information about the experiment to make an informed decision.
Fernandez Lynch confirmed that Nuremberg only pertains to research and would have nothing to do with any COVID-19 vaccines given outside of a trial. But even if it did, the claim is bogus.
""People are consenting to get the vaccine,"" she said. So even if Nuremberg was applicable here, ""it’s not non-consensual. And no information is being hidden. It’s all very front and center.""
In the U.S., the FDA, for example, provides fact sheets for vaccine recipients that clearly state the findings of the clinical trials — including the potential risks and benefits — and a description of an emergency use authorization. An EUA is a bit different than full FDA approval, although the agency required a high level of evidence from a large, phase 3 randomized controlled trial.
Fernandez Lynch acknowledged, as the FDA does, that not everything is known about the vaccine, but noted that no one was being forced to be vaccinated and that there was full transparency.
""We ideally would be able to watch for longer to gather more safety information about these products, but we have to make tradeoffs when we’re in the middle of a pandemic,"" she said. ""And each individual person is going to have to decide whether those tradeoffs are acceptable to them.""
As our colleagues at Reuters have written, people in the U.K. give informed consent to be vaccinated, as outlined in the country’s Green Book. The consent forms for the COVID-19 vaccines are available on the government’s website.
In making his argument, Coleman focuses on the fact that the COVID-19 trials are still ongoing, referring viewers to the U.S. government’s clinical trial registration page for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which says the completion date for the trial is nearly two years away, on Jan. 31, 2023.
That’s true, but misleading. The trial won’t technically end until it follows participants for two years, but that neglects the reality that the main trial results are already available and have demonstrated the vaccine’s basic safety and efficacy in tens of thousands of individuals.
Based on that phase 3 trial information, which is publicly available and has been reviewed by multiple panels of experts, the U.S. and U.K. governments concluded the benefits outweigh the potential risks and decided to authorize the vaccine for emergency use. People getting the vaccines now are not trial participants.
Coleman also suggests that the U.K. government’s efforts to monitor people who are vaccinated is somehow suspicious.
""They advertise for special software so that they could keep track of the high number of adverse events they were expecting — for two years,"" he says.
That, too, is misleading. The government is not necessarily expecting adverse events, but does want to be able to detect them if they occur. This is standard practice after the release of a new vaccine and the U.S. has similar efforts underway.
As we’ve explained before, these vaccine safety monitoring systems are important because while large phase 3 trials can show that there are no common safety concerns, rare events might only be observed once the vaccine is given to millions of people.
Bogus Claims of Vaccine-Related Deaths
A prevailing theme throughout Coleman’s video is the baseless idea that the available COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to large numbers of people.
""Thousands of people who’ve had the vaccine have died or been seriously injured by it,"" he says. ""That’s an undeniable fact. Elderly people in care homes are dying in huge numbers. We’re told it’s the infection, but it’s not, of course, it’s the damned vaccine they’re being given.""
Coleman later claims there is a ""horrifying avalanche of evidence showing that these damned vaccines are killing and maiming people"" and says, ""This is genocide.""
As his supposed proof, Coleman rattles off headlines from dubious websites proclaiming that people have died, without mentioning that the deaths have not been shown to be caused by the vaccine — and very likely are completely coincidental.
For example, Coleman cites an article from Health Impact News, a website known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, that misleadingly claims ""181 Dead in the U.S. During 2 Week Period From Experimental COVID Injections."" The number comes from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which as we’ve written before, does not imply that the vaccine was necessarily responsible. Anyone can report through an online form and there is no vetting of the report. 
In another case, Coleman reads off a headline from another vaccine misinformation website about a man and woman in South Dakota dying a day after getting a vaccine. But he doesn’t mention that the state’s department of health concluded that immunization didn’t contribute to those deaths.
There is no evidence that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are harming people on any kind of wide scale. While many people have the expected sore arms or temporary flu-like symptoms following vaccination, serious side effects are uncommon.
A review of the vaccine safety monitoring data in the U.K. through the end of January found that the ""overall safety experience"" with the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines ""is so far as expected from the clinical trials,"" with the expected benefits ""far outweigh[ing] any currently known side effects.""
According to the report, severe allergic reactions occurred in a small number of people, but these are very rare and have not resulted in death.
In the U.S., the vaccine safety monitoring data also is very encouraging. Dr. Paul Offit said in a Feb. 11 interview with JAMA that a recent review by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had not revealed any safety signals from the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines.
One potential issue raised by the trials was that the vaccines might very occasionally trigger a usually temporary form of facial paralysis known as Bell’s Palsy. But so far, Offit said, there’s no sign that the condition is any more likely in people who get vaccinated. Data from the U.K. also support that finding.
According to a paper the CDC published in JAMA Insights, cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, following the vaccines in the U.S. are also very unusual  — 2.5 cases per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as of Jan. 18.
Officials in the U.S. are investigating a few instances of thrombocytopenia, or a lack of blood-clotting platelets, following vaccination, including one death. But it is still unknown whether that type of reaction can be due to COVID-19 vaccination. Even if it is, it would be an extremely rare event and experts say it would pose less risk than the chance of getting COVID-19 and suffering severe health consequences.
Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says ""women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen."" As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see ""Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause."" 
It’s true, of course, that people have died after receiving a vaccine — but this doesn’t mean the vaccine is to blame for the deaths. Every day, around 8,000 people in the U.S. die from a variety of causes. And as the University of California, San Francisco’s department of medicine chair Dr. Robert Wachter has pointed out, if 10 million people are vaccinated, in the following two months you’d expect 4,025 of those people to have a heart attack, 3,975 to have a stroke and 14,000 to die. ""And the vaccines will have zero to do with any of them,"" he wrote.
""There are always going to be these temporal associations, and you read about them in the newspaper,"" said Offit. ""But at least right now, those temporal associations have not been found to be causal associations.""
This is especially the case when vaccines are being given to older people who may not be in good health.
""Older age and chronic underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events will occur, especially given the millions of people vaccinated,"" the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency explains in its report. ""It is therefore important that we carefully review these reports to distinguish possible side effects from illness that would have occurred irrespective of vaccination.""
Other Claims
Throughout the video, Coleman makes a series of other false claims, including the long-debunked notion that COVID-19 ""has been proved to be no more dangerous than the annual flu."" That’s wrong.
While scientists are still trying to pin down how deadly COVID-19 is, studies estimate that between 0.5% and 1.0% of people who are infected with the coronavirus will die — much more than influenza’s usually well below 0.1% mortality rate, as we’ve written. 
And the sheer number of deaths from COVID-19 far outstrip those for influenza. As of Feb. 11, more than 470,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to the CDC. That’s more than the estimated number of flu deaths from the past 10 flu seasons combined — and more than 20 times the number of deaths estimated to have occurred during the 2019-2020 flu season.
Coleman also cites statements from the World Health Organization to undermine and distort the facts on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.
""The fact is that even the World Health Organization only expects these vaccines to help reduce the extent of the symptoms,"" he says. ""They’re not promising that the vaccine will stop people getting COVID-19 and they’re not expecting the vaccine to stop people spreading the infection if they do get it.""
No one can promise that a vaccine will prevent disease in all people, as no vaccine is 100% effective. But data from the trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, for example, found that vaccinated people were 94% or 95% less likely to develop symptoms of COVID-19 than those who were unvaccinated.
It’s true that the vaccines may not prevent infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as the trials were primarily designed to show that the vaccines kept people from falling ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) 
But it’s incorrect to say that the WHO is not expecting the vaccines to do anything for transmission. On webpages dedicated to the Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines, the agency simply says that there isn’t data or that it’s not known yet if vaccination will protect against onward transmission. The WHO has also said the same more broadly in press briefings. 
In fact, many scientists do expect COVID-19 vaccines to keep people from spreading the virus to at least some degree. That’s because it’s likely an infected but mildly ill or asymptomatic person would shed less virus and therefore be less contagious than a sicker unvaccinated person. But because this has not been demonstrated or known to what degree viral spread might be halted, public health officials have been upfront that it’s possible the vaccines may only prevent disease.

		A voicemail message being left at the homes of voters in Pennsylvania and elsewhere by the Republican National Committee makes a number of misleading claims about presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter and Trump’s handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The phone message, which repeatedly refers to President Donald Trump’s rival as ""Beijing Biden,"" says: ""Beijing Biden’s son Hunter penned a $1.5 billion deal with a Chinese investment fund to make $80,000 per month from China in the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak.""
That’s wrong in some respects and misleading in others. As we and others have written, Hunter Biden was involved in the formation of a private equity fund with Chinese firms. But that deal, as the Wall Street Journal reported at the time, occurred in 2014 – long before the current pandemic. The call also leaves the misleading impression that Hunter Biden may have earned $1.5 billion as part of that deal, but the dollar amount is a reference to the new fund’s $1.5 billion investment goal for 2014.
There is no support for the call’s claim that Hunter Biden made ""$80,000 per month from China in the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak.""
The message ends with the assertion that Trump’s ""first priority is the health and safety of the American people, not his family’s pocketbook.""
We asked an RNC spokesman for information supporting its claims about Hunter Biden but never heard back from him.
The Trump campaign and its allies have long criticized the Bidens over Hunter’s business dealings in China and Ukraine while his father was vice president. But, in both cases, there’s no evidence that either Biden did anything illegal or that the former vice president used his office to enrich his son, as we have written.
Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, from April 2014 to April 2019, and he stepped down from the board of BHR Partners, the Chinese equity fund, in October 2019.
George Mesires, Hunter Biden’s attorney, said of the RNC call: ""This is false. Hunter Biden resigned from the BHR board of directors in October 2019, and the board position was unpaid. Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR’s board of directors nor has he received any return on his investment, which was a commitment to contribute approximately $420,000, not $1.5 billion.""
The RNC message, which presents itself as an ""important update on President Trump’s response to COVID-19 and how it saved Americans’ lives,"" repeats other unsupported claims that Trump has frequently made before.
The message asserts that the China travel restrictions the Trump administration implemented on Feb. 2 ""saved millions of lives."" When we looked into this previously, we found no support for such figures, and the White House didn’t provide any.
The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries imposed on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
As we’ve written, it’s possible the U.S. travel restrictions on China had some impact in slowing the importation of cases, but we don’t have evidence of that, or of how large the impact might be.
After the mention of the travel restrictions, the message says, ""Beijing Biden accused President Trump of hysteria, xenophobia and fearmongering before finally agreeing with President Trump’s decision in April."" It’s true that Biden said that about Trump and that he endorsed the travel restrictions in April. But it is misleading to connect the two.
As we have reported, on Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced, Biden, while campaigning in Iowa, said that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans ""need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it."" He added, ""This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.""
In his remarks that day, Biden didn’t mention the travel restrictions — which prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S., with exceptions for legal permanent residents and immediate family members — so it’s unclear what he meant when he criticized Trump’s ""hysterical xenophobia."" The Biden campaign told us the candidate wasn’t referring to the travel rules, but rather to what it called Trump’s ""long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China.""
On April 3, the Biden campaign said its candidate backed the travel restrictions.
The references to ""Beijing Biden"" reflect the Trump campaign’s efforts, through a number of advertisements, to portray the former vice president as unduly close to China. We reported previously on some misleading aspects of one of the ads. And while it is true that Biden has said quite positive things about China and its people, so, too, has Trump. For example, on Jan. 22 the president tweeted, ""One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA & China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country.""
In recent weeks, however, Trump has been critical of China for failing to do more to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. For example, at a coronavirus task force briefing May 11, Trump said, ""I’m not happy with China. They should’ve stopped this at the source.""
Michael Joyce, a spokesman for the RNC, said the organization leaves a message when it calls voters and no one answers. He said the message varies in different parts of the country. He couldn’t say precisely where this one was being used, but said it was likely being used in states that, such as Pennsylvania, haven’t had their primaries yet. Pennsylvania, where we know this message was left, has its primaries on June 2.
To sum up: It’s perfectly fair for the RNC to criticize Biden’s policies on China. But to suggest, without evidence, that those policies were influenced by his ""family’s pocketbook"" is off base.

		In a flurry of tweets and remarks, President Donald Trump continued to distort the facts on the coronavirus pandemic:

In a series of comments focused on the surging number of COVID-19 cases elsewhere in the world, Trump left the misleading impression that the U.S. is doing better than several countries seeing recent upticks in cases. But nearly all of the nations he mentioned still have fewer new daily per capita cases than the U.S.
The president said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus task force member, was ""wrong"" that Europe was more successful in reducing new cases partly because countries had more restrictive lockdowns than the U.S. Instead, Trump inaccurately insisted that the U.S. has more cases because of more testing.
Trump repeated the misleading claim that COVID-19 cases are ""up"" in the U.S. ""because of BIG Testing."" Cases are high because of ongoing transmission, not just because of testing. Coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that the recent outbreaks, unlike those in the early days of the pandemic, are ""extraordinarily widespread.""

Resurgences in Other Countries
In recent remarks, Trump has noted that other nations are currently experiencing worrisome upticks in coronavirus cases. While this is true, his emphasis and description of these surges could leave audiences incorrectly believing the U.S. is in better shape than certain parts of Europe and Asia.
In a July 30 press briefing, for example, the president referred to ""tremendous problems"" occurring across the globe.
Trump, July 30: All over the world, they’re having tremendous problems. A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet — in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong — places where they thought it was — they had really done great. It came back. And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly.
He then gave a few eye-popping statistics of the amount of growth in coronavirus cases in select countries. 
""Since the beginning of June,"" he said, ""daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times — that’s 35 times — in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few. These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised.""
Later, in an Aug. 2 tweet, Trump retweeted information about a state of disaster declaration in Victoria, Australia, adding, ""Big China Virus breakouts all over the World, including nations which were thought to have done a great job. The Fake News doesn’t report this. USA will be stronger than ever before, and soon!""
The following day, Trump alluded to other countries having a ""major second wave"" of cases in another tweet, and said that the U.S had handled the virus ""MUCH better.""
The White House did not respond to our request for more information, so we are not sure which exact days or the source he used in making his comparisons. The factor increases Trump cited are in line, if not lower, than the numbers from Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford. But importantly, the large changes are only possible because those countries had very few new coronavirus cases in early June.
Japan, for instance, had only 33 new cases on June 1, which increased some 34 times to 1,126 cases by July 30, the day of Trump’s remarks. Similarly, Australia and Israel had only 10 and 59 cases, respectively, on June 1, which rose 28 and 34 times to 278 and 2,001 cases on July 30.
In contrast, the U.S. didn’t experience such a large change — less than a 4-fold increase — but started and ended with more daily cases: 19,807 new cases on June 1 and 74,985 new cases on July 30.
Adjusted for population, only Israel is similar to the U.S. in terms of new COVID-19 cases, and had a slightly higher seven-day average figure than the U.S. on July 30. As of Aug. 4, Israel has dipped below the U.S.; Australia has more than nine times fewer new cases per capita than the U.S. and Japan has more than 16 times fewer cases, per Our World in Data’s seven-day rolling average.

Importantly, all of the nations Trump singled out for having resurgences successfully reduced their case numbers to low levels in May and June, which the U.S. did not manage to do.
And even with the rise in cases now, all the nations Trump mentioned, other than Israel, are far below the U.S.’s seven-day average per capita case count of 183 cases per million people per day.

Hong Kong, which is not included in Our World of Data, is posting no more than 150 cases per day, per Worldometer, or about 20 cases per million people. The U.S. has more than nine times that many new daily cases per million people. 
And while Trump repeatedly suggests that the U.S. has more cases because of more testing, it isn’t true that these other nations aren’t testing as much. With the exception of Hong Kong, all of the nations singled out by Trump have been conducting more tests per coronavirus case identified than the U.S.
In an Aug. 3 press briefing, the president again noted ""very significant flare ups"" in Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, and in response to a question about the state of the pandemic in the U.S., said, ""I think we’re doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation.""
""If you really look, if you take a look at what’s going on, especially now with all these flareups and nations that they were talking about,"" he said. ""Don’t forget, we’re much bigger, other than India and China. China’s having a massive flareup right down. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems.""
The U.S., by a variety of metrics, has not ""done as well as any nation."" 
The outbreaks in numerous countries have been smaller and led to fewer deaths, even when including more recent upticks. South Korea, for instance, quickly brought its number of cases down after a burst of infections in March and has largely kept it that way, limiting the total number of cases to fewer than 15,000 and deaths to 301. Australia’s outbreak has also been puny by comparison, with fewer than 20,000 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 232 deaths as of Aug. 4. 
The U.S., meanwhile, has racked up more than 4.7 million cases and more than 156,000 deaths, according to the COVID-19 dashboard from Johns Hopkins University. That works out to 14,240 cases per million U.S. residents, versus 281 per million in South Korea and 718 per million in Australia.
As of Aug. 4, the U.S. had a mortality rate of 47.5 per 100,000 people, but Australia (0.93), Japan (0.8), South Korea (0.58) all have mortality rates of less than 1 person per 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins.
In an interview with Axios that aired Aug. 3, Trump objected to focusing on deaths as a proportion of the population, pointing instead to deaths as a proportion of total cases. ""You have to go by the cases,"" he said, claiming that the statistic showed the U.S. is ""lower than Europe.""
The U.S. has a case-fatality rate of 3.3%, lower than many countries in Europe, including France, Spain and Germany. But there are also many countries with lower rates than the U.S., including Australia (1.2%), Japan (2.5%), Israel (0.7%) and South Korea (2.1%).
That measure shows how deadly the disease has been for those who have been identified as infected, but looking at deaths per 100,000 population shows how the disease has affected the total population of a country.
Nor is the current situation in the U.S. particularly rosy. On July 29, researchers at Johns Hopkins released a report urging changes to America’s pandemic response. ""Unlike many countries in the world,"" the authors wrote, ""the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic.""
All countries must be prepared for resurgences in COVID-19 cases, which at times may grow rapidly. But Trump omits the fact that viral transmission in the U.S. never declined substantially, unlike many of the countries experiencing upticks, and that there are more new daily per capita cases in the U.S. than in virtually all of the nations he highlighted.
Fauci on Europe’s Shutdown
The president also claimed in a tweet that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was ""wrong"" in saying in a July 31 congressional hearing that more restrictive lockdowns in European countries led to a sharper decline in cases than what the U.S. has achieved. Trump falsely claimed the difference was due to testing. ""We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country,"" he said.

Wrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France & Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard & smart. We will come back STRONG!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2020

In the congressional hearing, Fauci was asked by Rep. James Clyburn, chairman of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, ""why Europe has largely contained the virus"" while ""the United States has seen a continued rise in new cases?"" Clyburn showed a chart of the daily new confirmed coronavirus cases per million people for the U.S. and Europe.
Fauci, July 31: The answer to that question is really somewhat complex but I’ll try maybe to very briefly go through what I believe are at least some of the factors that were involved. If you look at what happened in Europe when they shut down or locked down or went to shelter in place, however you want to describe it, they really did it to the tune of about 95 plus percent of the country did that. When you actually look at what we did even though we shut down, even though it created a great deal of difficulty, we really functionally shut down only about 50% in the sense of the totality of the country. Which means when we reached our peak as they did, they came down almost to a low baseline as you’ve shown very clearly.
But take a look at what happened to our baseline, we came up, down and then we plateaued at about 20,000 cases a day. So, we started off with a very difficult baseline of transmission that was going on at the time that we tried to open up the country.
Fauci went on to say that some states reopened ""very well"" and others didn’t, and the latter ""led to the surging that you’re showing on your chart there. And one of the reasons is not doing some of the things that [CDC Director] Dr. Redfield mentioned in his opening statement, universal wearing of masks, avoiding crowds, forced physical distancing, et cetera, et cetera. So it’s a complicated reason why those charts are that way and hopefully as we’re going forward we can turn those around and I do believe we can.""
Here’s a version of the chart Clyburn showed:

Trump’s alternative explanation for the difference — ""We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country"" — reminded us of the president’s claim in a July ""Fox News Sunday"" interview that other countries, later mentioning Europe, are only testing for COVID-19 if someone is ""really sick"" and that the ""massive"" testing in the U.S. ""skews the numbers."" As we found, many countries, including in Europe, have conducted more tests per confirmed case than the U.S.
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told us in an email that ""tests per confirmed case provides an indication of how aggressively a country is testing. And many countries are at much higher rates than the US.""
As of Aug. 3, the U.S. had conducted 12.3 tests per confirmed case of COVID-19, using the seven-day rolling average figures from Our World in Data. That’s fewer tests per case than 20-some European countries, with the exclusion of France and Sweden – though the available information for those two countries dates back to early July and May.
Among the countries the president has recently mentioned, Spain has conducted 16.3 tests per confirmed case as of July 30, and Germany has done 39 as of July 26. Israel (26.4), Japan (22.3) and Australia (244.8) all have conducted more tests per confirmed case.
Testing Not Sole Cause of Increase in Cases
Trump once again made the misleading claim, in an Aug. 3 tweet, that coronavirus cases in the U.S. have gone ""up because of BIG Testing."" As we’ve written, increased testing will lead to more cases, but it doesn’t account for all of the uptick in some parts of the country. The percentage of tests that were positive also went up in many states.
When we looked into this issue in June, Katherine Ellingson, an epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, told us that the data on cases and testing ""suggests that community transmission is increasing, and that increasing case counts are not simply an artifact of testing.""
In some of the hard-hit states, the percentage of tests that were positive increased significantly this summer. For example, in Arizona, the seven-day average for the test positivity rate, as analyzed by Johns Hopkins University, was around 7% in mid-May, spiked to more than 27% in July and has now declined to 18%. 
Florida had a 5% positivity rate or lower for nearly all of May, but for most of July into August, the rate has been above 18%. In Texas, the positivity rate was around 5% at the end of May, hit nearly 18% in July and was about 12% to 14% in recent days.
As of Aug. 4, Johns Hopkins University shows 33 states experiencing an increase in the seven-day positivity rate.
Trump chooses to focus instead on states that are below 5%. He said in an Aug. 3 press briefing: ""Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates under 5%,"" mentioning Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and New York, among others.
Some areas also have seen increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, which should not occur if additional testing is the only driver of more coronavirus cases.
Two members of the White House’s coronavirus task force also have contradicted Trump’s claims about testing. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the task force, said on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" on Aug. 2 that the U.S. was in a ""new phase"" of the outbreak and that the virus was ""more widespread.""
""What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread. It’s into the rural as equal urban areas,"" Birx said. ""To everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune or protected from this virus.""
She recommended those in multigenerational households in areas where there is an outbreak ""consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you’re positive, if you have individuals in your households with comorbidities.""
(Trump tweeted that after being criticized by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Birx ""took the bait & hit us. Pathetic!"")
Fauci told members of the House in that July 31 hearing: ""We see, if you do more testing, you’re going to see more cases. But the increases that we’re seeing are real increasing in cases, as also reflected by increasing in hospitalization and increasing in deaths.""
The seven-day rolling average of deaths per million people in the United States has gone up, from less than or around 2 in late June and early July to 3.38 on July 31, the day Fauci made his remarks, according to Our World in Data.

		A new book by journalist Bob Woodward shows that President Donald Trump sought to downplay the seriousness of the novel coronavirus despite the fact that he knew just how dangerous it was.
One way he did that was to liken the coronavirus to the flu, even though he told Woodward in early February that the coronavirus was far more lethal. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump misleadingly contrasted the total deaths of an entire flu season with very preliminary numbers for the coronavirus.
In a Jan. 28 intelligence briefing, Woodward writes in ""Rage,"" National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien told Trump that the virus would be the ""biggest national security threat"" he would face.
In taped interviews, Trump underscored to Woodward just how deadly the disease could be. In a Feb. 7 conversation, Trump told Woodward, ""This is deadly stuff,"" adding that it might be five times more lethal than the flu. Trump said, ""It’s also more deadly than your – you know, your, even your strenuous flus.""
Yet, as we have written, from Jan. 22 through March, Trump constantly minimized the danger of the disease. He often did so by comparing it to the flu, as he did at a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24.
Trump, March 24: I brought some numbers here. We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number — you know, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season. But we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, ""Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore."" We have to get back to work.
Trump frequently said the disease would simply go away. On Feb. 10, he said, ""You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in.""  
On March 19, Trump told Woodward he was understating the threat on purpose. ""I wanted to always play it down,"" he said, adding, ""I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.""
There have been 6,354,869 coronavirus cases in the United States and 190,589 deaths as of Sept. 9, according to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center.
Despite knowing the severity of the threat, here’s what the president said in public remarks, interviews and tweets from Jan. 22 through March, often likening the novel coronavirus to the flu as a way of downplaying the danger.
Jan. 22: ""We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine."" — Trump in a CNBC interview.
Feb. 10: ""Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now."" — Trump at the White House. (See our item ""Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?"")
Feb. 26: ""I want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it that — and I spoke with Dr. [Anthony] Fauci on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it: The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And, so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people and their recovery, one is — one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover, but the others are in great shape. But think of that: 25,000 to 69,000. Over the last 10 years, we’ve lost 360,000."" 
""This will end. This will end. You look at flu season. I said 26,000 people? I’ve never heard of a number like that. Twenty-six thousand people going up to 69,000 people, Doctor — you told me before. Sixty-nine thousand people die every year — from 26 [thousand] to 69 [thousand] — every year from the flu. Now, think of that. It’s incredible.""
""But when I mentioned the flu, I said — actually, I asked the various doctors. I said, ‘Is this just like flu?’ Because people die from the flu. And this is very unusual. And it is a little bit different, but in some ways it’s easier and in some ways it’s a little bit tougher.""
""But that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner."" — Trump at a White House coronavirus task force briefing.
Feb. 27: ""It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear."" — Trump at a White House meeting with African American leaders.
Feb. 28: ""So a number that nobody heard of that I heard of recently, and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? Thirty-five thousand, that’s a lot of people. It could go to a hundred thousand. It could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die, and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t. But think of it, you hear 35 and 40,000 people and we’ve lost nobody. You wonder, the press is in hysteria mode."" — Trump at a rally in North Charleston, South Carolina.
March 4: ""[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40-plus people [from a cruise ship]. … We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers. But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States."" — Trump at a White House meeting with airline CEOs.
March 4: ""Now, with the regular flu, you know, we average from 27,000 to 77,000 deaths a year. Who would think that? I never knew that, until six or eight weeks ago. I asked that question. I said, how many people die of the flu? You know, you keep hearing about flu shot, flu shot, take your flu shot. But I said, how many people die of the flu? And they said, sir, we lose between 27,000 and, you know, somewhere in the 70s. I think we went as high as 100,000 people died in 1990, if you can believe that. But a lot of people, regardless, I think it averages about 36,000 people a year. So I said, wow. And that’s — now, that’s a percentage that’s under 1% very substantially. So, it would be interesting to see what that difference is. But, you know, again, a lot of people don’t report, because they get the coronavirus, and they get better relatively quickly. Not that severe."" — Trump in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity.
March 6: ""We’ve had 11 deaths, and they’ve been largely old people who are — who were susceptible to what’s happening. Now, that would be the case, I assume, with a regular flu too. If somebody is old and in a weakened state or ill, they’re susceptible to the common flu too. You know, they were telling me just now that the common flu kills people and old people is sort of a target."" 
""Well, we’re considering different things [for dealing with the coronavirus]. But we’re also considering the fact that last year we had approximately 36,000 deaths due to what’s called the flu. And I was — when I first heard this four, five, six weeks ago — when I was hearing the amount of people that died with flu, I was shocked to hear it. Anywhere from 27,000 to 70,000 or 77,000. And I guess they said, in 1990, that was in particular very bad; it was higher than that."" — Trump after a tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
March 9: ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"" — Trump in a tweet.
March 10: ""Look, right now, I guess we’re at 26 deaths, and if you look at the flu — the flu, for this year — we’re at 8 mil- — we’re looking at 8,000 deaths.  And, you know, hundreds of thousands of cases, but we have 8,000 deaths. So you have 8,000 versus 26 deaths, at this time. With all of that being said, we’re taking this unbelievably seriously, and I think we’re doing a really good job. And, again, the task force, headed up by the vice president, has been fantastic.""
""And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away."" — Trump after meeting with Republican senators.
March 13: Trump declares a national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus.

      China Didn’t Stop Virus ‘Cold’ Outside Wuhan

		In remarks about SARS-CoV-2, President Donald Trump wrongly said China ""stopped it cold"" from spreading from Wuhan to other parts of China ""but they didn’t stop it cold from coming to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world."" Trump called that ""a little strange deal,"" promising to seek answers.
But China did not stop the coronavirus from spreading from Wuhan, where it originated, to other parts of China. The number of reported cases and deaths in China’s major cities outside Wuhan have been far lower than the numbers in many European and American cities, but China also took extreme measures to slow the spread of the disease that the U.S. did not.
In the past, Trump has wrongly speculated that China stopped flights from Wuhan to the rest of China while continuing to allow flights from Wuhan all over the world, including to the U.S. But as we wrote, that’s not accurate, either.
More recently, Trump has not mentioned the stoppage of flights, but has simply said China suspiciously has not been hit as hard by the coronavirus as Europe and the U.S.
In a Fox News Radio interview on June 3, Trump asked why the coronavirus that came out of Wuhan ""didn’t go to China but it went to the rest of the world,"" including the U.S. Trump then attributed it to a purposeful act by China.
 Trump, June 3: And I ask this, ""Why is it Wuhan, it came out of Wuhan. Why is it that it didn’t go to China but it went to the rest of the world? It went to Europe. It went to the world. It went to the United States. But it didn’t go to Beijing. It didn’t go to other parts of China. What’s that all about? So how come they let it go out to the world, but they didn’t let it go into China. That’s a little strange deal going on there.""
In a press conference on June 8, Trump made similar comments.
Trump, June 8: And you do say, ""How come at Wuhan, where it started …"" And they were very badly — they were in bad trouble. But it didn’t go to any other parts. It didn’t go to Beijing. It didn’t go to other parts of China. Then you say, ""How come it came out to Europe, to the world, to the United States?"" So it didn’t go to China; they stopped it cold. They knew it was a problem. But they didn’t stop it cold from coming to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. Somebody has to ask these questions, and we’ll get down to the answer.
Many questions have been raised about China’s response to the coronavirus, and whether its leaders downplayed the threat or withheld information from world health officials. An in-depth report from the Associated Press on June 3 concluded that China delayed the release of coronavirus information to the World Health Organization, including the genome sequence of the virus. And, the article said, this lack of transparency came at a critical time, when it might have been possible to change the trajectory of the coronavirus death toll.
But Trump’s claim that China was able to stop the coronavirus ""cold"" from spreading outside Wuhan to other parts of China is inaccurate.
Cases Outside Wuhan
According to World Health Organization data, there were 81,048 confirmed cases in China of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as of March 15. While the vast majority of those cases were in Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, there were 13,254 cases outside Hubei (including 119 people who died). As for Beijing specifically, which the president mentioned, there were 442 confirmed cases and eight deaths by March 15.
As of that date, China led the world by far in the number of confirmed cases, while the U.S. had 5,702 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. In other words, at that time, there were more than double the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China, outside Hubei, than there were in the U.S.
In the following weeks, however, the picture changed dramatically, with cases in Europe and the U.S. spiraling upwards, and overtaking the number of confirmed cases in China (where the figures remained fairly constant).
We should note that Trump has questioned the data on cases coming from China. As the U.S. tally overtook China’s later in March, Trump said the U.S. numbers were ""a tribute to our testing,"" and he questioned the veracity of figures coming from China.
Trump, March 26: You know, number one, you don’t know what the numbers are in China. China tells you numbers, and — I’m speaking to President Xi tonight, I believe, and we’ll have a good conversation, I’m sure. But you just don’t know, you know, what are the numbers.
Trump isn’t alone in doubting China’s reported figures. A study from academics at the Hong Kong University School of Public Health, published in the Lancet, found that changing case definitions for COVID-19 by Chinese authorities led to a major undercount early in the outbreak. According to their research, although China reported about 55,500 confirmed cases on Feb. 20, the likely number of infections at that date was four times as high.
Even still, the confirmed cases in the U.S. have far surpassed the reported number of cases in China.
On June 9, as the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. approached 2 million, the number of reported cases in China — just over 84,000, including 594 cases and nine deaths in Beijing — hadn’t risen much from the reported figure in mid-March, according to data from Johns Hopkins.
Experts say the reason for that is less nefarious than Trump’s comments suggest.
According to research published in the Lancet on April 8, China implemented ""massive public health interventions"" in late January that helped to stem the spread of the virus. Those measures worked, researchers concluded. ""The findings from our modelling impact assessment suggest that the comprehensive package of non-pharmaceutical interventions China undertook, including social distancing and population behavioural change, has substantially reduced transmissibility of COVID-19 across the country,"" the authors wrote. 
On Jan. 23, China imposed severe travel restrictions on Wuhan, halting train and air travel from the bustling city of 11 million people. 
In late April and early May, Trump floated the flawed theory that China continued to allow flights out of Wuhan to Western cities while blocking flights into other cities in China. Specifically, the president claimed China stopped travel from Wuhan to other parts of China even as it allowed flights from Wuhan to Europe and the U.S. But as we wrote, that’s not accurate.
There is no evidence any commercial flights left Wuhan for Western destinations after Jan. 23, other than some repatriation flights chartered by foreign governments, such as U.S. evacuation flights for American citizens, including diplomats and their families.
Niall Ferguson, a Harvard professor who first raised questions about China’s flights out of Wuhan to international destinations, later updated his column to acknowledge that flight data did not confirm that China continued to allow commercial flights to various international destinations, including the U.S., after Jan. 23. And further research by Ferguson concluded that while a half dozen flights left Wuhan for destinations in Asia outside China, ""only crew members appear to have been aboard these flights … confirm[ing] that the authorities did prevent Chinese citizens from flying from Wuhan to foreign destinations after January 23.""
In addition to locking down Wuhan, China at the same time enacted ""stringent social distancing measures and mobility restrictions"" in most of China’s largest cities, according to the research published in the Lancet. Schools were closed, and ""only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down.""
By contrast, Trump issued ""Coronavirus Guidelines for America"" for the following 15 days on March 16 (nearly two months after China’s announced measures), in which he urged ""all Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts."" Those guidelines — which were later extended to April 30 — were not orders. Numerous states, however, did issue mandatory orders, including school and non-essential business closures. Constitutional experts told us states, not the president, have the authority for such stay-at-home orders.
In an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was recommending that Americans wear a cloth or fabric mask to limit the spread of the virus. Trump stressed that the CDC recommendation was ""a voluntary thing.""
""You can do it. You don’t have to do it,"" Trump said. ""I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay.""
The CDC said the recommendation came as new studies showed ""a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.""
""A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others,"" the updated CDC website now reads. ""This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.""
As we said earlier, China instituted mandatory mask-wearing in public in late January. It also enacted stringent stay-at-home orders.
Research from Columbia University epidemiologists posted in late May concluded that the U.S.’s delay in implementing social distancing cost lives. According to their estimates, if social distancing measures had been implemented just a week prior than they were in mid-March about 36,000 fewer people would have died; and if such measures had been implemented two weeks prior, about 54,000 fewer people would have died.
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health who led the study, told us Trump’s comments about China stopping the virus cold in its own country while allowing it to ""go out to the world"" are ""absurd and highlight our own inability to control the virus.""
""If we believe the case and death numbers coming from China, then the differences are due to the effectiveness of the control that China imposed,"" Shaman said in an email. ""China is an authoritarian regime, they shut down travel on January 23rd to and from Wuhan and ultimately put 750M citizens around the country under enforced shelter-in-place. This disrupted transmission and drove the reproductive number and incidence down.
""The government built apps that Chinese citizens must use to gain access (by QR scan) to common locations (buses, shops, etc.)—individuals have to scan everywhere they go now, and the scan then reads out a color indicating whether the individual can enter,"" he added. ""They perform screening and temperature checks at a very high rate, quarantine incoming travelers, isolate infections, and use the app to identify individuals who may have been exposed to infection and if so quarantine them. They use technology and their authoritarian powers to control the virus. We are doing neither.""
A recent study – which has been accepted for publication in Nature – on the effectiveness of pandemic control policies enacted by various countries concluded that non-pharmaceutical interventions greatly reduced the number of infections. For China, the research group estimated there would be about 465 times the number of confirmed cases if ""large-scale anti-contagion polices had not been deployed."" For the U.S., the estimate was that confirmed cases would have been 14 times greater if not for its policy interventions.
 ""Consistent with process-based simulations of COVID-19 infections, our analysis of existing policies indicates that seemingly small delays in policy deployment likely produced dramatically different health outcomes,"" the authors wrote.
Again, much has yet to be learned about China’s response to the coronavirus and what it communicated to world health officials. But, contrary to Trump’s claim, the virus did spread outside Wuhan to other parts of China, according to figures provided by Chinese authorities (and which some experts believe to be undercounts).
That the virus did not spread as widely in China as it did in other countries, including the U.S., is largely the result of extreme measures taken by the Chinese government to control its spread, experts said. Europe and the U.S., experts said, did not implement measures as stringent as China did, and the ones they did implement were not enacted as early.

      Trump’s Snowballing China Travel Claim

		In early March, President Donald Trump said that restrictions he placed on travel to and from China ""saved a lot of lives,"" a claim that grew to ""probably tens of thousands"" and ""hundreds of thousands"" by early April. But we found no support for such figures.
The few studies that have been done estimate the U.S.’ and other countries’ travel restrictions regarding China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. We didn’t find a study that looked at the U.S. restrictions alone, and we found only one non-peer-reviewed study, on Australia, that found an impact of such policies on deaths, though it has significant limitations. 
Past studies, too, have found international travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us he hasn’t seen any evidence to support the president’s claims. Previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the restrictions have to be very strict to have an effect, he said. Travel restrictions ""can have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,"" Omer said. But, ""even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.""
Omer co-authored a Feb. 3 article on why a travel ban wouldn’t stop the coronavirus.
Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, looked at several of the same studies we examined and concluded that ""by themselves, travel restrictions do little but delay the onset of a crisis mentality and shift the curve to the right rather than flattening it.""

As we have found with prior claims from the president, Trump’s assertions have progressively grown:
Trump, March 5, Fox News town hall: But as soon as I heard that China had a problem, I said, ""What’s going on with China? How many people are coming in?"" … [Y]ou both know that I closed the borders very early. …. You know, it saved a lot of lives.
Trump, March 17, coronavirus task force briefing: We closed it down to China, the source, very, very early. Very, very early. Far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. And I think, in the end, that’s going to be — that will have saved a tremendous number of lives.
Trump, March 24, Fox News virtual town hall: I made a decision to close off to China. … Thousands and thousands of more people — probably tens of thousands would be dead right now if I didn’t make that decision.
Trump, April 7, task force briefing: And I was called all sorts of names when I closed it down to China. …. If I didn’t do it — if I didn’t do that, we would’ve had hundreds of thousands more people dying.
We asked the White House for support for the president’s claims, specifically whether there was support for his claims of ""tens of thousands"" or ""hundreds of thousands"" of lives saved. We haven’t received a response.
On Jan. 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. As of that date, there were nine confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S., though there had been very little testing. At that point, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not yet sent test kits to public health labs, so all testing was done through the CDC.
Currently, the U.S. has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world. As of April 10, the U.S. had more than 486,000 cases and nearly 18,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
Under the travel restrictions, non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks.
Research on the Coronavirus Travel Restrictions
As we’ve written before, a study published in the journal Science on March 6 estimated that travel restrictions instituted in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and those put in place by several countries in early February regarding China would ""only modestly"" affect the spread of the pandemic.
The researchers — a team from the U.S., Italy and China, led by Northeastern University in Boston — used a model to estimate the impact. The model showed that a travel ban in Wuhan ""was initially effective at reducing international case importations,"" but ""the number of cases observed outside Mainland China will resume its growth after 2-3 weeks from cases that originated elsewhere."" It found that restrictions by other countries would have ""a modest effect"" if they reduced travel to and from China by up to 90%, unless those restrictions were ""paired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility.""
In other words, travel restrictions could delay, but not stop, the spread of the disease, and social distancing and hand-washing behaviors would reduce the transmission of the disease.
Another study published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences similarly found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries ""likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19.""
The researchers, mostly with the Yale School of Public Health, said that ""rapid contact tracing"" was ""essential"" to limit person-to-person spread.
The study did find that the travel lockdowns put in place in Wuhan and Hubei province lowered the daily rate of exportation of cases from China by 81.3% on average by Feb. 15. ""At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response,"" the study said.
The study also found that airport screening ""has only a moderate benefit"" early in the epidemic, as most people — 64% — travel during the incubation period, before exhibiting symptoms.
The study, which relied on data on the outbreak in China and airline network data to make its estimates, concluded that travel restriction measures are ""unlikely to contain the outbreak,"" but they could delay the importation of cases, providing time for unaffected areas to prepare a public health response.
A third recent study, by researchers in China, the U.S. and the U.K., looked at both the travel restrictions and other emergency measures put in place in China only, estimating that shutting down Wuhan slowed the virus’ spread to other cities in China by 2.91 days.
The study, which was published in Science on March 31, concluded that the delay ""provided extra time to prepare for the arrival of COVID-19 in more than 130 cities across China but would not have curbed transmission after infection had been exported to new locations from Wuhan.""
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has praised Trump’s travel restrictions on China, saying the U.S. has dealt with a lower number of cases because of the policies. At a press conference on Feb. 29, Fauci said, ""If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.""
The studies we cited suggest that the travel restrictions could have slowed down, but not stopped, the importation of COVID-19 in the U.S. But when we looked into this issue in early March, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us there’s no evidence to show that and some reasons that it may not be the case — chiefly, the lack of testing, particularly early on. 
""[W]e weren’t seriously looking for cases in the US,"" Nuzzo said.
Initially, the CDC testing criteria focused on those with symptoms who also had been to Wuhan or in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. By late February, those criteria included anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced doctors could order tests if they thought one was needed. 
Also, the U.S. restrictions were limited. In February, Nuzzo said, other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren’t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. ""would likely not have picked it up"" if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries were infected with the virus ""because we weren’t using these other countries as criteria for testing,"" she said.
Omer, of the Yale Institute for Global Health, echoed that, saying, ""People coming from Italy wouldn’t have been stopped,"" whether they exhibited symptoms or not. (Trump’s restrictions on travel from Europe didn’t go into effect until March 13.)
The ability of the virus to elude limited travel restrictions raises questions about the one study we did find that estimates an impact on deaths. The study — which hasn’t been peer-reviewed — estimated Australia’s restrictions on travel from China will lower the potential number of deaths from COVID-19 in the country over the next year. However, it didn’t consider any impact of cases coming in from other countries, saying it ""illustrates the principle of travel bans and public health impact on epidemic control using China as a case study.""
The study, posted without peer review on medRxiv on March 12, estimated the travel restrictions, implemented Feb. 1, would reduce the cases and deaths by 87% over 400 days. The case and death counts are relatively low in Australia: 6,215 cases and 54 deaths as of April 10, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.
Past Studies Find Delay, Not Containment
Several past studies have looked at the impact of travel restrictions on epidemics. They also have found some delay in the spread of the diseases, if the restrictions are significant, but not containment.

A 2014 review of 23 studies on the impact of travel restrictions on the spread of influenza found overall they have ""only limited effectiveness,"" the degree of which varied depending on the restrictions themselves, epidemic size, transmissibility of the virus and other geographic considerations. The review, published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, said: ""In isolation, travel restrictions might delay the spread and peak of pandemics by a few weeks or months but we found no evidence that they would contain influenza within a defined geographical area.""
A 2011 study (included in the above review) on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic published in the journal PLOS One found that travel restrictions creating a 40% reduction in air traffic to and from Mexico, the origin of the influenza strain, caused a three-day or less delay, on average, in the first imported cases reaching other countries. It said that ""no containment was achieved by such restrictions."" Even assuming an unlikely 90% air traffic reduction, the study said, ""the resulting delay would be on the order of 2 weeks.""
A 2012 study published in BMC Infectious Diseases by researchers in Hong Kong estimated that ""imposing a 99% air travel restriction"" would delay the peak of a new influenza pandemic in Hong Kong ""by up to two weeks."" But, ""[a]ntivirals and hospitalization were found to be more effective on attack rate reductions than travel restrictions,"" the study said.

It’s possible that the U.S. travel restrictions on China could have had some impact in slowing the importation of cases to the U.S. But we don’t have evidence of that, or of what that impact is, let alone evidence that ""hundreds of thousands"" of lives were saved, as the president claimed.

		In this video, we explain the distinction between virus and disease: The virus SARS-CoV-2 can lead to illness with the disease COVID-19.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained this difference between infection with the virus and the disease in an interview on CNN, saying that with vaccination against COVID-19: ""You could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected.""
A viral video distorted those comments, falsely suggesting that a COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S doesn’t ""protect you from covid."" The vaccine does protect against the disease COVID-19. Fauci was cautioning that it may not prevent someone from contracting the virus.  
For more on the viral distortion, see our SciCheck story ""Video Misinterprets Fauci’s Comments on COVID-19 Vaccine"" or the Spanish version, ""Video tergiversa comentarios de Fauci sobre vacuna contra COVID-19.""

		SciCheck Digest
Stanford Medicine says it ""strongly supports the use of face masks to control the spread of COVID-19."" Yet viral stories falsely claim a ""Stanford study"" showed that face masks are unsafe and ineffective against COVID-19. The paper is a hypothesis, not a study, from someone with no current affiliation with Stanford. Update: The paper was retracted.

Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Lab tests, for example, show that masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Analyses of people who came into contact with those with COVID-19 have also found mask-wearing to be associated with a reduced risk of contracting the virus. Numerous studies similarly document an association between self-reported mask wearing and control of the virus in a community or the implementation of a mask mandate and a subsequent decline in COVID-19 cases.
While each of these study types has its limitations, collectively, most experts agree that masks are likely to reduce transmission of the coronavirus and should be used by members of the public when around other people. Some research also indicates face masks can protect the wearer as well.
Masks, however, should not be viewed as fool-proof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. For optimal performance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people select masks that are well-fitting and multi-layered. For more, see our SciCheck story, ""The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.""

Full Story
Evidence indicating that face masks can help control the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has grown since the virus first emerged, upending life around the world. In March, we outlined the evolving research on the efficacy of face masks and explained why experts support their use.
But a stubborn thread of misinformation falsely claiming that masks do not work, and are actually dangerous, continues to be recycled and shared a year-plus into the pandemic.

Viral headlines in recent days have wrongly purported that a ""Stanford Study"" proved that masks are ineffective and dangerous. In reality, the paper in question was one author’s hypothesis and didn’t come from anyone currently affiliated with the university.
""Stanford Study Results: Facemasks are Ineffective to Block Transmission of COVID-19 and Actually Can Cause Health Deterioration and Premature Death,"" reads an April 19 headline from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website known for spreading misinformation. The story — shared on Facebook nearly 28,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data — cites another website, NOQ report, whose story was published two days earlier.
The American Conservative Movement website similarly ran the headline, ""Stanford study quietly published at NIH.gov proves face masks are absolutely worthless against Covid."" It was shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
The paper being referenced was not an original ""study,"" but one person’s hypothesis — or proposed explanation — based on a review of some previous literature. It was first published online in November by the journal Medical Hypotheses, which describes itself as ""a forum for ideas in medicine and related biomedical sciences."" While the paper appears on PubMed Central — an archive of scientific literature run by the National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine — that does not indicate NIH endorses or concurs with the content, as some of the viral stories wrongly suggest.
The paper’s author, Baruch Vainshelboim, is listed as being affiliated with the ""Cardiology Division, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System/Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States.""
But Julie Greicius, a spokesperson for Stanford Health Care and the university’s School of Medicine, told us in an email that ""[t]he author’s affiliation is inaccurately attributed to Stanford, and we have requested a correction"" from the author and the journal. 
""The author, Baruch Vainshelboim, had no affiliation with the VA Palo Alto Health System or Stanford at the time of publication and has not had any affiliation since 2016, when his one-year term as a visiting scholar on matters unrelated to this paper ended,"" she said in an email. She also noted that ""Stanford Medicine strongly supports the use of face masks to control the spread of COVID-19.""
A spokesperson for VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Michael Hill-Jackson, also told us in an email that ""Baruch Vainshelboim does not work for the VA and is incorrectly affiliated on this website."" He said Vainshelboim ""served as a postdoc assistant under one of our researchers from 2015-2016, however, he was never officially employed by VA and his time in this role is completely unrelated to this paper.""
So, no, the paper is not a study from Stanford, as the headlines claim. It’s unclear where Vainshelboim currently works or why the paper featured the incorrect affiliation. We sent him several questions but haven’t heard back.
We reached out to the editor of Medical Hypotheses, Mehar Manku, about Vainshelboim’s paper and he said in an email that the journal was aware of ""issues related to the publication in question"" and that ""[a]ctions are in progress.""
Update, May 3: At Manku’s request, Elsevier, publisher of Medical Hypotheses, has retracted Vainshelboim’s paper and apologized to its readers ""for difficulties this issue has caused."" The retraction, in part, reads:
The Editorial Committee concluded that the author’s hypothesis is misleading on the following basis:
1. A broader review of existing scientific evidence clearly shows that approved masks with correct certification, and worn in compliance with guidelines, are an effective prevention of COVID-19 transmission.
2. The manuscript misquotes and selectively cites published papers. References #16, 17, 25 and 26 are all misquoted.
3. Table 1. Physiological and Psychological Effects of Wearing Facemask and Their Potential Health Consequences, generated by the author. All data in the table is unverified, and there are several speculative statements.
4. The author submitted that he is currently affiliated to Stanford University, and VA Palo Alto Health Care System. However, both institutions have confirmed that Dr Vainshelboim ended his connection with them in 2016.
In the paper, Vainshelboim lays out a hypothesis against the utility of masks and concludes that they are ""ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such [as] SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19."" It claims at one point, ""Due to the difference in sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter and facemasks thread diameter (the virus is 1000 times smaller), SARS-CoV-2 can easily pass through any facemask.""
J. Alex Huffman, an aerosol scientist at the University of Denver, told us in a phone interview that the paper betrayed a fundamental lack of understanding of respiratory aerosols.
""Viruses don’t come out of your mouth as naked viruses,"" he said. ""They come out in liquid drops that are full of mostly water but also some proteins and salts"" — and, if someone is sick, virus.
Huffman further said in an email that ""there is a wide distribution of particle sizes emitted when people breathe, speak, sing, or cough, but the range is anywhere from tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns. Most of these, even after evaporation, are easily removed by good masks.""
Indeed, lab studies have shown masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Such studies have limitations, but they continue to suggest that masks — especially ones that are multi-layered and fit well — can play a role in stopping the spread of COVID-19.
For example, one study by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health tested a variety of face coverings for their ability to prevent the outward spread of particles from a simulated cough. N95 respirators performed the best — blocking 99% of the particles — while medical masks blocked 59% and a three-ply cloth mask blocked 51%. (A face shield, on the other hand, stopped just 2%.)
And in another experiment, researchers in Japan evaluated how well different masks on two mannequins that faced one another reduced exposure to the coronavirus. One mannequin was connected to a nebulizer, which produced a simulated cough, ""mimicking a virus spreader,"" and the other was connected to an artificial ventilator to simulate breathing. If both mannequins wore a cotton or surgical mask, transmission decreased by 60% to 70%.
For more information on the research surrounding face masks, see our SciCheck story ""The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.""
Vainshelboim’s paper also claims that masks ""restrict breathing, causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia."" Hypoxemia is the term for insufficient oxygen in the blood; hypercapnia is the presence of too much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. 
Experts have repeatedly rebuffed that claim, and we’ve previously addressed unfounded claims that masks cause unsafe oxygen levels.
""For many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions,"" the Mayo Clinic Health System notes. ""The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks while in public, and this option is very breathable. There is no risk of hypoxia, which is lower oxygen levels, in healthy adults. Carbon dioxide will freely diffuse through your mask as you breathe.""
The American Lung Association also notes: ""We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur."" (However, it recommends that people with preexisting lung disease contact a doctor before wearing an N95 respirator.)

		On the subject of President Donald Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden misquoted Trump as saying, ""I probably got it from Blue Star parents."" That’s not what Trump said.
In an Oct. 8 interview with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he always assumed he might contract the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 because as president, he has to meet with people and cannot always remain socially distanced. He mentioned a White House reception on Sept. 27 for the families of military veterans who died in action as one example.
""I meet a lot of people and I have to. I’m the president of the country. I can’t hang around in a basement,"" Trump said. ""So, I figured there would be a chance that I would catch it. Sometimes I’d be with — in groups of — for instance, Gold Star families.""
""I met with Gold Star families. I didn’t want to cancel that. But they all came in and they all talked about their son and daughter and father. And they all came up to me and they tell me a story, Maria,"" Trump said. ""And they tell me these stories and I can’t say, ‘Back up, stand 10 feet.’ I just can’t do it.""
Several new outlets, including CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Military Times, wrote that what Trump said ""appears to blame"" those families, or ""suggests"" they were responsible for him testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. 
But Biden went beyond that characterization in his remarks later that day at a campaign event in the swing state of Arizona.
After saying veterans ""deserve better than a president who will say anything to deflect responsibility for any mistake he makes,"" Biden went on to say: ""I don’t know whether you noticed, he recently said that, they asked him where he got the COVID, he said, ‘I probably got it from Blue Star parents.’ They’re people who lost a child in battle.""
Trump didn’t say that.
When Bartiromo actually asked Trump how he may have contracted the virus, he didn’t provide a direct answer. He first talked about how Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis became infected even though they often wear face masks.
""You catch this thing. It’s, you know, it’s — it’s particles of dust. It’s tiny stuff,"" Trump said. 
""Now, as far as the White House is concerned, somebody got in. There was a day of celebration with Notre Dame, et cetera, et cetera. Somebody got in and people got affected,"" he added, making an apparent reference to a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who teaches law at the university. 
At least 11 people who attended that event, including Trump, have since tested positive for the coronavirus.
It wasn’t until later in the interview, when Bartiromo again asked Trump about his condition and his symptoms, that Trump brought up the risk he takes when interacting with people he meets, including Gold Star families. 
(Biden mentioned Blue Star families, which are immediate family members of those who served during a time of conflict. But Gold Star families are immediate relatives of those who died while serving in a time of conflict.)
Bartiromo, Oct: 8: And you said it was a blessing in disguise.
Trump: A blessing in disguise. I’m — I’m glad because I’m the leader. And I can’t be like Biden where I hang out in a basement every day. Sure, he — if I wanted to hang out in a basement, I wouldn’t catch it, but I meet a lot of people and I have to. I’m the president of the country. I can’t hang around in a basement.
So, I figured there would be a chance that I would catch it. Sometimes I’d be with — in groups of — for instance Gold Star families. I met with Gold Star families. I didn’t want to cancel that. But they all came in and they all talked about their son and daughter and father.
And, you know, they all came up to me and they tell me a story, Maria. It was really amazing actually, beautiful but sad. And they come up and they tell me a story about my son, sir, was in Iraq or he was in Afghanistan. And sir, he did this and he did that and then he charged in order to save his friends.
And yes, sir, he was killed but he saved his friends. He’s so brave, sir. And they tell me these stories and I can’t say, ""Back up, stand 10 feet."" I just can’t do it. And I went through like 35 people and everyone had a different story. I could also say don’t tell stories. They’re telling the story of their son who just died or daughter —
Bartiromo: Right.
Trump: — or husband who just died in a war or recently died, you know, mostly over the last 10, 12 years but some very recent. And I can’t back up, Maria, and say, ""Give me room, I want room. Give me 12 feet, stay 12 feet away when you talk."" They come, they come, within an inch of my face sometimes.
They want to hug me and they want to kiss me. And they do. And frankly, I’m not telling them to back up. I’m not doing it. But I did say it’s like, you know — it’s obviously dangerous. It’s a dangerous thing I guess if you go by the COVID thing. But I’m thinking —
Bartiromo: Yes.
Trump: Look, I look at the numbers. I figured that you probably — that probably at some point I’d catch it and I’ll get better. That’s what happened. I’ve caught it.
When later asked about Trump’s remarks, a White House spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, told reporters the president wasn’t faulting Gold Star families.
""His point was merely that in the time frame that he was potentially exposed, there were a number of different venues that he’d been at and individuals he had interacted with that it could have come from — and by no means are blaming anyone who was present,"" she said. ""And we did take a lot of precautions for that event. So based on contact tracing, the data we have, we don’t think it arose from that event.""
None of the families who attended the reception have since tested positive for the virus or shown symptoms, according to news reports, although some had been photographed with the president.

      Old Photo Shows Obama, Fauci at U.S. Facility — Not ‘Wuhan Lab’

		Quick Take
An image circulating on social media claims to show former President Barack Obama, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Melinda Gates at the ""Wuhan lab in 2015."" The photo was actually taken at the National Institutes of Health campus in Maryland — and Melinda Gates is not in the picture.


Full Story 
A years-old photo of former President Barack Obama and Dr. Anthony Fauci is spreading on Facebook with a false claim to suggest a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Dr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015…!!!!"" reads text at the top of the viral image.
Below it, a screenshot of a tweet shows a photo of Obama speaking with a scientist as Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stands in the background alongside a woman misidentified as Melinda Gates.
The tweet’s text claims that the picture shows ""Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the WuHan lab where they paid the lab 3.7 million for a ‘bat’ project? We know that we’ll now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!""
But the photo is not from ""the Wuhan lab""; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.
A reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014 — in the U.S.
The picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.
Obama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell — not Melinda Gates.
The tweet’s claim that ""they paid the lab 3.7 million for a ‘bat’ project,"" meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that we’ve addressed multiple times before.
That figure refers to an NIH grant — which actually totaled $3.4 million — awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.
The organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealth’s spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.
EcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH — but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.

      The HHS Inspector General Report

		In a testy exchange with reporters, President Donald Trump questioned the political motivations of an administration inspector general, claiming that her report on hospital experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic was ""wrong."" The report gave the results of a survey of 323 hospitals across the country.
We asked the White House how the report from the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General was ""wrong."" We haven’t received a response. On Twitter, the president claimed the report was ""Another Fake Dossier!""
We encourage readers to examine the report for themselves. We find it to be a straight-forward report on the results of a survey.
Released April 6, the HHS inspector general’s report detailed the results of the survey of hospital administrators, making clear in the opening sentences that it provides ""a national snapshot of hospitals’ challenges and needs in responding to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic"" and ""is not a review of HHS response to the COVID-19 pandemic.""
The information is meant ""as an aid for HHS as it continues to lead efforts to address the public health emergency and support hospitals and other first responders,"" the report continued. It also said hospitals ""may find the information about each other’s strategies useful.""
The survey was conducted March 23–27, and the report noted several times that the responses from hospitals reflect a ""point in time."" It said: ""Since our interviews, some hospital challenges may have worsened and others may have improved.""
During the April 6 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump said that 1.79 million tests for COVID-19 had been conducted nationwide. (Data collected by the COVID Tracking Project, run by journalists, researchers and others, showed 1.9 million as of April 6.) The Trump administration has faced criticism for a slow rollout of testing and a lack of availability of widespread testing in the U.S. The number of tests conducted daily has increased from about 50,000 to 70,000 from March 23 to March 25 to consistently 100,000 or more from March 26 on.
Trump again boasted of the U.S. doing more testing ""than any other country in the world,"" but despite the growth in testing, that’s still not true on a per-capita basis. Italy and South Korea have done more per-capita tests as of April 7, a chart from Our World in Data shows, noting that there are ""substantial differences"" in the way the data are reported by country. 
In the briefing, a reporter asked Trump about the survey’s finding that ""the number one complaint from those hospitals were severe shortages of testing supplies and a really long wait time.""
Trump replied: ""Did I hear the word ‘inspector general’? Really? It’s wrong. And they’ll talk to you about it. It’s wrong.""
Three days earlier, on April 3, Trump fired the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who had informed Congress about the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump’s impeachment.
The president asked for the HHS inspector general’s name and said, ""Could politics be entered into that?""
As the reporter said, the survey did find: ""Hospitals reported that their most significant challenges centered on testing and caring for patients with COVID-19 and keeping staff safe. … Hospitals reported that severe shortages of testing supplies and extended waits for test results limited hospitals’ ability to monitor the health of patients and staff.""
The random phone survey of 323 hospitals in 46 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, focused on ""three key questions"":

What are your most difficult challenges in responding to COVID-19?
What strategies is your hospital using to address or mitigate these challenges?
How could government best support hospitals responding to COVID-19?

On the availability of testing, the report said: ""Hospitals reported that they were unable to keep up with COVID-19 testing demands because they lacked complete kits and/or the individual components and supplies needed to complete tests. Additionally, hospitals reported frequently waiting 7 days or longer for test results. When patient stays were extended while awaiting test results, this strained bed availability, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and staffing.""
The supplies needed to conduct tests included ""nasal swabs, viral transfer media, and reagents used to detect the virus."" The report said the hospitals were ""unable to effectively test staff, patients, and others in the community who reported that they were concerned about possible exposure,"" with one hospital administrator saying ""millions [of tests] are needed"" throughout the industry ""and we only have hundreds.""
In addition to the testing concerns, hospitals reported ""widespread shortages of PPE""; problems maintaining ""adequate staffing levels""; concerns about hospital capacity to care for patients; ""shortages of critical supplies, materials, and logistic support,"" such as intravenous therapy poles, linens, food and cleaning supplies; anticipation of not having enough ventilators; rising costs and decreased revenue; and ""changing and sometimes inconsistent guidance from Federal, State, and local authorities"" that caused confusion for hospitals and the public.
Later in the April 6 briefing, a reporter told Trump that the inspector general’s name was Christi Grimm, and ""it wasn’t so much her opinion, but they interviewed 323 different hospitals."" Trump replied, ""It still could be her opinion.""
The report, again, presented the results of the survey, which showed the experiences and opinions of hospital administrators — not of the HHS inspector general.
Trump asked reporters when Grimm was appointed and how long she had served in government, tweeting a day later that she ""spent 8 years with the Obama Administration."" But Grimm joined the HHS Office of the Inspector General in 1999, according to her bio on HHS.gov, meaning she had worked in the last four administrations. She previously worked for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Grimm was appointed to her current position of principal deputy inspector general of HHS in January.
Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at HHS, admitted in the briefing that it was ""true"" that there had been ""several days of backlog at some of the major labs,"" an issue he said had been resolved. The inspector general report, he said, ""was done here — 23rd and 24th — during our ramp-up period, quite a long time ago.""
During the time period of the survey (March 23-27), however, Trump first made misleading claims about the amount of testing the U.S. had done compared with other countries.
In a March 24 virtual town hall aired on Fox News, Trump said, ""We’ve done more than South Korea in a short period of time,"" referring to a claim that the U.S. had done more testing in eight days than South Korea had done in eight weeks. The U.S. had conducted nearly 360,000 tests at that point, including some with results pending, according to the COVID Tracking Project. But South Korea, and other countries, had done more testing on a per-capita basis, despite Trump’s claim the following day in a briefing that ""we now are doing more testing than anybody, by far.""
In that March 25 briefing, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that ""it’s going to take us a while to work through the testing backlog."" The following day, Vice President Mike Pence said that he was ""pleased to report that testing is available in all 50 states.""
As we said, the IG report acknowledges that the experiences of hospitals could well have changed since the survey was conducted.
""We recognize that HHS is also getting input from hospitals and other frontline responders and has already taken and continues to take actions toward each of these suggestions,"" it also said.
We asked the HHS inspector general’s office about Trump’s comments, and Tesia Williams, director of communications for the HHS OIG, replied in a statement: ""We approached this survey with the same integrity and quality standards as we have in previous work.""
She reiterated some of the language of the report, saying: ""Let me be clear, the survey is not a review of HHS’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, we collected this information as an aid for HHS and other decision-makers as they continue to lead efforts to address the public health emergency and support hospitals and other first responders. We recognize that HHS, Congress, and other government entities across the Federal, State, local, and Tribal levels are taking substantial actions on a continual basis to support hospitals in responding to COVID-19. HHS has already taken and continues to take actions related to each of the challenges that hospitals identified in our survey, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provides the basis for additional actions.""

		SciCheck Digest
Dubious websites and viral posts falsely claim that the World Health Organization changed COVID-19 testing protocols for political reasons following Joe Biden’s inauguration and admitted that false-positive cases had been inflating the case count. The WHO’s guidance merely reminded labs to follow instructions provided by each test’s manufacturer.

Full Story
A recent memo from the World Health Organization designed for lab professionals became a major focus of misinformation — with unreliable websites and social media users claiming the agency had changed a testing protocol and admitted that COVID-19 cases have been wildly inflated.
But neither of those claims is accurate.
Instead, the Jan. 20 memo directed labs facilitating polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests to carefully follow manufacturer instructions for testing to prevent false positive and negative results.
The distortions online also tied the purported change to U.S. politics.
""An Hour After Joe Biden Is Sworn In, WHO Admits Their Testing Grossly Overstates Individuals Testing Positive for COVID,"" read a headline from the Gateway Pundit, a website known for spreading misinformation. The story questioned the motives of public health agencies, asking, ""how can these entities ever be trusted again?""
The story was shared more than 8,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
Another website, Zero Hedge, which also has previously spread falsehoods, similarly told readers: ""Right On Cue For Biden, WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce COVID False Positives."" That story was shared on Facebook nearly 7,000 times.

Many posts also cited a viral tweet from David Samadi, a urologist and contributor to the conservative news channel Newsmax, whose work in a New York hospital was the subject of a federal investigation into fraudulent Medicare claims. That hospital reached a $12.3 million settlement in late 2019.
In his tweet, which has since been deleted, Samadi said the guidance instructed labs ""to reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases,"" because ""the current cycle was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case."" One Facebook post sharing Samadi’s tweet claimed that the guidance proved ""they’ve been lying to you about case counts and mortality rate THE WHOLE TIME.""
As we said, the WHO guidance implied no such admission. And the memo was an updated version of one issued a month earlier, on Dec. 14, so the idea that it was timed for Biden’s inauguration is wrong.
As we’ve explained before, PCR tests work by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. (See our SciCheck article ""The Facts on Coronavirus Testing."")
The PCR test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load, meaning more virus is present in the sample, will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles.
There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — ""although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint"" of a PCR run — Ian MacKay, a virologist in Australia, told us in an email. 
The WHO’s Jan. 20 guidance said it was requesting that those conducting tests be sure to read manufacturer instructions ""carefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended.""
In a statement to FactCheck.org, the WHO said it had received 10 reports since early 2020 about some PCR tests providing both false positive and false negative results and that ""[a]fter thorough investigation, WHO confirmed that the tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer."" 

""In particular, users in laboratories encountered problems with these tests when they did not apply the recommended positivity threshold — this can result in either false negative results (if the threshold applied is lower) or false positives (if threshold is higher),"" the WHO said.
MacKay said that problem ""is not a test issue; it’s a human training and experience issue.""
""I suspect this is more a problem for certain countries or jurisdictions where rapid roll-out of new testing labs has occurred; labs that are new to public health testing,"" MacKay said. ""This would typically involve places that have failed to adequately invest in a good public health laboratory network, to begin with. I don’t think anything shows changing threshold values or less experienced laboratories have driven significant inflation of COVID-19 case counts though.""
Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said in a phone interview that the WHO guidance was a simple reminder that if lab professionals deviate from the recommended manufacturer thresholds they’re ""going to over- or under-call the positives or negatives."" She said the issue was not a significant concern in the U.S.
In a blog post batting down the misconceptions about the WHO’s guidance, MacKay wrote that ""this lab-focused advice has been taken by those with malicious intent, or with too little understanding of the topic, and blown it up into something else entirely wrong.""
He further emphasized to us that ""PCR results are not a diagnosis by themselves"" — they’re part of the COVID-19 diagnosis. WHO advises they be considered in context of other factors, including symptoms and potential exposure to COVID-19.
Understanding Cycle Threshold Values

PCR tests are considered a gold standard for diagnostics among scientists, and while false negative and positive results are possible with any test, false positives from PCR tests are not thought to be a major or systemic issue — even positive results at high-cycle threshold values — experts say.
For example, MacKay has observed that, looking at COVID-19 data on tests in the United Kingdom, even reducing the ""cycle number by 10 (from, for example, 45 to 35), for the sake of appeasement, the majority of positives would still be uncontroversially positive.""
Matthew Binnicker, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, said the true debate over results at high-cycle threshold values isn’t whether they are ""false positives.""
""PCR tests are very specific, and these are not false-positives,"" he told us in an email. ""The test is doing what it was designed to do — detect the viral RNA in samples.""
Instead, he said, the tension among scientists concerns whether the values can be used ""to determine whether someone is, or is not, ‘infectious'"" to others. In other words, the question isn’t whether someone contracted the coronavirus, but rather, whether that person is likely to still be contagious and should be told to isolate and have their contacts traced. 
""Some would argue that we should be ignoring low-positive PCR results (i.e., those with a high PCR cycle threshold value), as these results may mean that someone is no longer infectious,"" Binnicker said. 
But, he said, such a result could also mean that a person only very recently became infected and has yet to hit peak infectiousness.
And, he cautioned, the quality and type of sample can also affect how many cycles are needed to detect the virus, so it’s not always the case that a high-cycle result means a person is harboring remnants or only small amounts of the virus.
Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, likewise said getting positive test results at high-cycle threshold values ""doesn’t mean they’re false positive, they’re still actually detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.""
Mina said during a call with reporters that the WHO’s memo served as a reminder that ""you have to be discerning about how to evaluate"" cycle threshold values. ""And if you’re going to start using the actual values from the PCR as part of your decision-making, [it’s important] to really know what it is you’re doing.""
For example, if someone is asymptomatic and happened to get a PCR test through testing as part of surveillance in a community, it may be a low viral load detected at a high-cycle threshold value — which could mean ""you already were infectious and you maybe don’t need to be isolated,"" he said.
""But it’s very hard to know that. You need to do repeated testing, you need to take that person and test them again,"" he added. ""Or, test them with an antigen test. That would be the other way to approach it."" (Antigen tests are a different type of test that can be used to quickly identify an active coronavirus infection.)
Binnicker also noted that, since patients who test positive for COVID-19 can sometimes continue to test positive long after recovering, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend PCR tests be used to determine when someone is no longer infectious. Instead, the agency advises relying on time and symptoms to break from quarantine or isolation.

      FactChecking Cruz’s Partisan Spin on COVID-19 Bill

		Sen. Ted Cruz says only 9% of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan ""focuses on health spending"" and that the remaining ""91% is a partisan wish list paying off the Democratic special interests that got them elected.""
While arguably 9% of the bill is for COVID-19 health spending — depending on how one defines that term — to call the remaining 91% a ""partisan wish list"" ignores that Republicans offered an alternative $618 billion rescue bill that included many of the same elements of the Democratic plan, albeit in smaller amounts.
For example, the bill passed by the House Democrats includes $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals earning less than $75,000 and $2,800 to married couples earning less than $150,000. That is estimated to cost about $422 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The alternative bill put forward by 10 Senate Republicans also proposed stimulus checks, though a smaller amount and to a smaller group of Americans. It proposed $1,000 per person checks for individuals. That would begin to phase out for those making more than $40,000 a year, and would stop at those making $50,000 a year or more. That was estimated by the bill’s authors to cost $220 billion.
Both bills also included extra money for unemployment insurance. The stimulus package passed in December gave jobless Americans an extra $300 per week in unemployment benefits, expiring in mid-March. The rescue plan passed by House Democrats on Feb. 27 would increase the weekly benefit from $300 to $400 through the end of August. That would cost an estimated $163 billion.
The Republican bill would have kept the extra weekly unemployment benefit at $300, but extended it through the end of June, costing the federal government an estimated $130 billion.
Cruz took aim at the House-passed COVID-19 relief bill during a Senate Republican press conference on March 4.
""This is not a COVID bill,"" Cruz said. ""9% of this bill focuses on COVID health spending. 91% is a partisan wish list, paying off the Democratic special interests that got them elected, and it’s cynical.""
The 9% figure has been a popular Republican talking point.
Arguing in a Feb. 24 press conference that the Democratic rescue plan is ""too costly"" and ""too liberal,"" House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, ""Only 9% goes to COVID.""
""We need our economy to go back to work, back to school, and back to health,"" McCarthy said in press conference two days later. ""But when you spend 91% on paying off your allies, it doesn’t do that.""
In a press conference on Feb. 23, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said, ""If you look at many of the components of their bill, for example the amount that they spent on public health, only constitutes about 10% of the entire $1.9 trillion."" The following day, he said, ""Just about 1% of the money is for vaccines.""
Speaking just about vaccine spending in the bill, McConnell’s comment is backed up by an analysis of the American Rescue Plan from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Government, which found, ""Less than 1% of the American Rescue Plan – about $17 billion – would be spent on vaccine-related activities and programs.""
There is also backing for Cruz’s statement that just 9% of the Democrats’ proposal ""focuses on COVID health spending.""
In addition to the $17 billion for vaccines, CRFB said another $110 billion would be spent on ""COVID containment."" That includes money for testing and tracing, FEMA disaster relief funds and other public health investments.
Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the CRFB, said there is ""probably a generous way to get to"" the 9% figure, such as including all of the $122 billion going to Energy and Commerce, plus the $47 billion going to FEMA. That comes to $169 billion, which is roughly 9% of the overall $1.9 trillion bill.
Of course, only including ""COVID health spending"" as the money going to address COVID-19, as McCarthy put it, or to say that it is ""not a COVID bill,"" as Cruz put it, is using a narrow definition of the terms. Much of the money is intended to offset the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.
A spokeswoman for Cruz said the 9% figure cited by Cruz is accurate and directed us to a pie chart produced by the Republican staff of the House Committee on the Budget. The Washington Post Fact Checker took issue with some of the elements contained in that graphic, however, such as the claim that 25% of the spending would go to ""policies that destroy jobs.""
We would note that 10 mostly moderate Republican senators proposed an alternative, $618 billion COVID-19 relief bill that included some of the same elements as the Democratic bill, though often with smaller dollar amounts. In a letter accompanying the proposal, the senators said they were offering the alternate plan ""in the spirit of bipartisanship.""
In addition to the reduced stimulus and unemployment benefit proposals, as mentioned above, the Republican plan also included $20 billion for K-12 schools (far less than the $130 billion in the Democratic plan, but not nothing) and $20 billion for child care block grants (the Democrats’ plan includes $40 billion). 
There is, of course, partisan disagreement over large portions of the Democratic plan. Indeed, there is a nearly $1.3 trillion gap between the spending proposals.
For example, the House plan calls for $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. Republicans, many of whom have called the state and local government aid a ""blue state bailout,"" did not include any such aid in their bill. In fact, all states would get a portion of that aid. Republicans have criticized the allocation formula, which is based on population and unemployment, the latter of which they say will benefit Democratic-controlled states. Nonetheless, as we have written, state tax experts say state and local government revenues are down overall as a result of the pandemic, resulting in the loss of about 1.3 million jobs, and among those that have seen the biggest revenue declines are a mix of red and blue states.
Republicans also have taken issue with other spending in the bill they deem unrelated to COVID-19 relief, including for some transportation projects derided by Republicans as ""pork."" (At least two of those projects have been removed from the Democrats’ bill.)
Still, the Republican bill contains many of the same non-health spending-related items in the Democratic bill, though often with substantially less funding. Cruz may not agree with the proposal proffered by 10 of his fellow Republicans in the Senate. But it’s a stretch for Cruz to classify 91% of the Democrats plan as ""a partisan wish list"" and for McCarthy to say 91% is spent on Democrats ""paying off … allies."" At least $600 billion of the Democrats’ plan can rightly be called bipartisan.

		Since President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 2 that he had tested positive for COVID-19, White House staff and the president’s physicians have provided confusing and at times contradictory information about the president’s health.
Trump’s medical team has portrayed his illness as relatively mild and improving, but also has shared details that would suggest the president may be sicker than they have described.
Here, we share what was said when and highlight instances in which information was not relayed with full accuracy or transparency.
Thursday, Oct. 1
Evening
Between 9 and 10 p.m. — Trump tells Fox News’ Sean Hannity: ""I’ll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning. But, you know, I spend a lot of time with Hope, and so does the first lady,"" in confirming that White House counselor Hope Hicks had tested positive. But before the Hannity interview, Trump had tested positive for COVID-19 using a rapid-results test, the Wall Street Journal later reported. He was awaiting the results on a more accurate test.
Friday, Oct. 2
Morning
12:54 a.m. — In a tweet, the president announces he has tested positive for COVID-19. ""Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!""
1:06 a.m. — Shortly after Trump’s announcement, the White House releases a memo dated Oct. 1 from the president’s doctor, Navy physician Sean P. Conley. ""This evening I received confirmation that both President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus,"" Conley says. He also says, ""The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence."" But those plans changed later in the day.
Afternoon
About 1:45 p.m. — In remarks to reporters, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany says the president is ""hard at work despite the mild symptoms.""
About 4 p.m — In a late afternoon memo, Conley provides a second update on the president’s condition and treatment. ""As of this afternoon, the President remains fatigued but in good spirits."" But, he adds, ""as a precautionary measure he received a single 8 gram dose of Regeneron’s polyclonal antibody cocktail.""
""In addition to the polyclonal antibodies, the President has been taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin,"" Conley says. There was no mention of the president receiving supplemental oxygen, which the public did not learn about until Sunday.
About 5 p.m. — Trump is taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a statement, the press secretary describes the president as being in ""good spirits"" with ""mild symptoms."" McEnany says, ""Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.""
Evening 
11:34 p.m. — The White House issues a third medical update from Conley. In the memo, Conley says that as of ""this evening"" Trump is ""doing very well"" but he had recommended that the president be moved to Walter Reed ""for further monitoring."" Conley adds, ""He is not requiring any supplemental oxygen, but in consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate Remdesivir therapy. He has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably."" In fact, Trump did receive supplemental oxygen that day.
Saturday, Oct. 3
Morning
At a late morning press briefing, Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist at Walter Reed, says that ""the President this morning is not on oxygen, not having difficulty breathing or walking around the White House Medical Unit upstairs."" Asked if that meant the president did not receive any supplemental oxygen, Conley responds, ""He’s not on oxygen right now."" Pressed again, Conley falsely says, ""Yesterday and today, he was not on oxygen.""
As for other medical treatments, Dr. Brian Garibaldi says, ""About 48 hours ago, the president received a special antibody therapy directed against the coronavirus, and we’re working very closely with the company to monitor him in terms of that outcome. Yesterday evening, he received his first dose of IV remdesivir. And our plan is to continue a five-day treatment course for remdesivir."" Garibaldi’s statement on when the antibody therapy treatment started seems to contradict Conley’s Friday evening memo.
Conley also causes confusion when he says that Trump was ""72 hours into the diagnosis,"" raising questions about when Trump was first diagnosed. A reporter asks Conley, ""You said 72 hours. That would put it that Wednesday."" He responds, ""So Thursday afternoon, following the news of a close contact is when we repeated testing. And given clinical indications, I had a little bit more concern. And that’s when, late that night, we got the PCR confirmation that he was.""
As for the president’s fever, Conley says, ""It’s important to note the president’s been fever free for over 24 hours."" He gives a generally upbeat assessment, describing the president as ""doing great"" — although that would almost immediately be contradicted by a top White House staffer.
After describing Trump’s vitals in good shape and his blood pressure in particular as ""great,"" Conley is asked why the president had been transferred to the hospital, to which Conley replies, ""Because he’s the president of the United States.""
Afternoon 
About 12 noon — In an email sent to reporters, the White House pool reporter traveling with the president passes along a statement that is attributed to ""a source familiar with the president’s health"" that says: ""The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery."" It was later disclosed that the anonymous source was White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
About 1:50 p.m. — The White House releases a statement from Conley that seeks to address the confusion about when the president was diagnosed and when treatment began.
""This morning while summarizing the President’s health, I incorrectly used the term ‘seventy-two hours’ instead of ‘day three’ and ‘forty eight hours’ instead of ‘day two’ with regard to his diagnosis and the administration of the polyclonal antibody therapy,"" he says. ""The President was first diagnosed with COVID-19 on the evening of Thursday, October 1st and had received Regeneron’s antibody cocktail on Friday, October 2nd.""
Evening 
6:51 p.m. — Trump speaks to the public for the first time since being hospitalized in a four-minute video that he posts on Twitter. ""I came here, wasn’t feeling so well. I feel much better now,"" he says. ""We’re working hard to get me all the way back."" 
9:08 p.m. — The White House releases a statement from Conley that says the president had made ""substantial progress.""
""This evening he completed his second dose of Remdesivir without complication,"" Conley says. ""He remains fever-free and off supplemental oxygen with a saturation level between 96 and 98% all day."" Conley’s statement does not clarify if the president had been on oxygen.
Sunday, Oct. 4
Morning 
Shortly before noon — Conley and other doctors treating Trump give a press briefing. Conley says that ""the president has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation,"" indicating Trump’s lungs may be compromised. As a result, the president began to take dexamethasone, a steroid drug.
Conley also discloses for the first time that the president had received supplemental oxygen on Friday, for about an hour. ""Late Friday morning, when I returned to the bedside, president had a high fever and his oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94%. Given these two developments, I was concerned for possible rapid progression of the illness,"" Conley says. ""I recommended the president we try some supplemental oxygen, see how he’d respond.""
Asked why he failed to disclose earlier that the president had received supplemental oxygen, Conley says: ""I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness has had. I didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction and in doing so, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true.""
When asked if Trump had received oxygen a second time, Conley suggests that the answer is no, but he isn’t definitive. ""I’d have to check with the nursing staff. If he did, it was very, very limited,"" he says, emphasizing that Trump was not on oxygen then and the only oxygen that Conley ordered had been on Friday morning.
The addition of dexamethasone to the president’s regimen is particularly curious, as the drug is not recommended for patients who are not on supplemental oxygen.
The RECOVERY trial in the U.K., which established the drug had a mortality benefit in hospitalized patients who were ventilated or on supplemental oxygen, did not find a benefit — and identified possible harm — in providing the drug to those who were not on oxygen at the time of randomization. 
This had led some physicians to speculate that Trump’s condition might be worse than what has been shared with the public, or that Trump might be receiving very aggressive treatment, which may not necessarily benefit him.
Conley also refuses to provide specifics on other information that would get at Trump’s medical condition. 
When asked about what X-rays or CT scans show, and whether there are signs of pneumonia or lung damage, Conley responds vaguely, ""We’re tracking all of that. There’s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern.""
""Expected findings,"" some doctors say, likely means some signs of lung damage — or at least enough concern to initiate the dexamethasone. As Vanderbilt University infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner told ABC News, Trump’s oxygen levels and CT scan results are ""undoubtedly what targeted physicians’ decision to add dexamethasone.""
Afternoon
5:16 p.m. — Trump posts a short video on Twitter. ""We’re getting great reports from the doctors,"" he says.
About 5:20 p.m. — Trump briefly leaves Walter Reed in a presidential motorcade to visit and wave to supporters outside before returning to the hospital. At least two Secret Service members, wearing what appeared to be N95 masks, were inside the enclosed vehicle with the president, who wore a mask. While the White House said the trip had been ""cleared"" by the medical team, some experts, including a physician at Walter Reed, considered the excursion unnecessarily risky for his security detail.
Monday, October 5
Afternoon
2:37 p.m. — Trump tweets: ""I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. … I feel better than I did 20 years ago!""
About 3:10 p.m. — Conley, the president’s physician, and others on the president’s medical team give an update on Trump’s health and his scheduled return to the White House. ""Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations — and most importantly his clinical status — support the president’s safe return home,"" Conley says.
Dooley says the president’s temperature on the morning of Oct. 5 was 98.1 degrees. Conley says the president has not received fever reducing medication for the last 72 hours.
Conley declines to discuss some details, such as the date of the president’s last negative test. Conley also would not share any information on the president’s viral load or possible lung damage. He would only say that the supplemental oxygen wasn’t required and the president wasn’t short of breath when it was administered, which happened twice. ""It was more of us trying to anticipate needs and see how he’d respond,"" he says, adding it was given for a short period of time.

		Available data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths contradicts President Donald Trump’s recent claim that ""the United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries.""
As of April 16, there were at least 90 countries with a lower case fatality rate than the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Trump made his claim about global coronavirus mortality rates during an April 16 press briefing by the White House coronavirus task force. At the same briefing, the president said a ""team of experts now agrees"" that the U.S. can begin the process of reopening businesses that have largely been shut down during the pandemic.
Trump, April 16: The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries.
Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we’re calling, ""Opening Up America Again.""  And that’s what we’re doing: We’re opening up our country. And we have to do that. America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open.
We asked the White House what information the president relied on, but we did not receive a response.
He’s wrong based on recent data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world.
The university has calculated the ""observed case-fatality ratio"" — the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases — for around 130 countries. As of April 16, at least 90 of those nations had a lower rate than the U.S. rate of 4.9%.
Some of those nations with a lower rate were Singapore (0.2%), New Zealand (0.6%), Australia (1%), Israel (1.1%), Japan (2.1%), South Korea (2.2%) Turkey (2.2%), Germany (2.9%), Portugal (3.3%)  and Canada (4.1%).
The data does show the case fatality rate in the U.S. was lower when compared with the other countries that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. had the third lowest rate among the 10 countries Johns Hopkins University said were ""most affected by COVID-19 worldwide,"" as of April 16. Only China (4%) and Germany had lower rates than the U.S. (and data as of April 17 indicate that China’s rate may now be up to 5.5%). Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Spain all had rates higher than 10%.
It’s important to note that Johns Hopkins University says differences in mortality rates can be caused by a number of reasons such as testing, demographics and health care systems.
""With more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio,"" the university said, for example.
Trump himself made this point at a March 29 briefing. 
""It’s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we’ve been testing,"" he said. ""It’s also one of the reasons that we’re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we’ve been doing more testing.""
The U.S., which is the third most populous country, has conducted more tests than any other nation – about 3.4 million, as of April 16, according to Our World in Data. But it lags behind other countries on a per-capita basis, as we have written before.
We should also point out that these case fatality rates are based on only the known coronavirus cases and deaths. Because unreported cases and deaths are not included, it’s difficult to say exactly what the rate of death from COVID-19 is in any country.  
But based on the global data we currently have about the disease, Trump’s claim that the U.S. mortality rate is lower than nearly all other nations is wrong.
Correction, April 20: We originally said the U.S. had the ""eighth lowest rate"" among the 10 most affected countries. It had the third lowest rate.

		Quick Take
A meme falsely claims that a health care workers’ union was ""caught hiding 39 million N95 masks,"" and other posts cast suspicion on the union’s motives. In reality, the union had called medical suppliers nationwide in an effort to find masks — and it never had or hid them.

Full Story
A California health care workers’ union launched a nationwide search on March 21 for face masks and other protective gear that have been in short supply since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the U.S. On March 26, the union announced that it had found a supplier with 39 million masks.
Within just a few days, that announcement had become a target of misinformation and suspicion.
First, some partisan websites suggested there was a connection between the union — Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West — and an announcement from Attorney General William Barr the same week. Barr warned that the Justice Department would pursue cases against those who are hoarding essential medical supplies.
There’s no evidence that the union’s announcement and Barr’s announcement are related. The SEIU-UHW began looking for the equipment on March 21, days before Barr’s March 24 announcement, and it never actually had possession of the masks.
Regardless, the suggestion was condensed into a meme from the conservative organization Turning Point USA that said: ""Coincidence?? Just 3 days after A.G. Barr announced they’re going after hoarders… SEIU union in California suddenly found a mysterious stash of 39 million face masks.""
It’s been shared more than 11,000 times from Turning Point USA’s Facebook page and nearly 2,000 times from Iowa Rep. Steve King’s page, as well as other political pages.
Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, told us by email, ""[N]othing definitive is stated in the meme, just asking the question, is this a coincidence? It doesn’t actually claim anything illicit or unethical, it just notes the timing is potentially suspicious. It also doesn’t say that the SEIU had the masks, but that ‘they found them’ in this case from a supplier.""
The more nuanced parts of that message weren’t clear to many of Turning Point USA’s social media followers, though. The group’s post garnered comments like this: ""I just want to know how you FIND 39 million face masks and why in the HELL did they have them to begin with?""
Another meme went further, claiming: ""SEIU was CAUGHT HIDING 39 MILLION N95 MASKS The SEIU only ‘found’ the much-needed masks after Atty. Gen. Barr threatened to file charges against them. People suspect SEIU was hiding the masks to cause a shortage / hurt Trump’s re-election.""
None of that is true.
The SEIU-UHW never had the masks. Rather, in an effort to answer the concerns of the health care workers the union represents, the SEIU-UHW started calling suppliers and distributors to locate equipment, according to the union’s announcement.
""We just started cold-calling potential suppliers because of the desperate need among the 97,000 healthcare workers we represent in CA and their co-workers, first responders, etc., and hit one who says he can get the masks,"" the union’s spokesman, Steve Trossman, told us by email.
""To be clear, we are not selling masks, have never had possession of any masks, and have no financial interest in this,"" Trossman wrote. ""We are simply connecting hospitals and other entities that need [personal protective equipment] with suppliers we have found who say they have supplies.""
The U.S. has faced a shortage of face masks since COVID-19 began sickening Americans, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization both recommend that, outside of health care settings, only those who are sick or caring for someone who is sick need to wear a mask. However, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who is also on the White House task force dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, recently said data that could suggest wider use of masks may help prevent the spread of the virus ""is being aggressively reviewed."" The CDC has said that it currently has no plans to issue new guidance.

      FactChecking Biden’s Inaugural Address

		Returning to a time when inaugural addresses promised unity and hope, but few facts, the newly sworn-in President Joe Biden delivered a traditional speech at his inauguration that offered little for fact-checkers.
When he did offer us some facts to check, the 46th president of the United States largely hit his marks on domestic threats, COVID-19 and the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913 in a 21-minute speech.
Domestic Threats
Biden, Jan. 20: And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.
Biden is correct about the rise in ""political extremism."" Even before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the Department of Homeland Security warned in its Homeland Threat Assessment report, which was issued in October, about ""an elevated threat environment"" from political extremists.
""Some U.S.-based violent extremists have capitalized on increased social and political tensions in 2020, which will drive an elevated threat environment at least through early 2021,"" the report said. ""Violent extremists will continue to target individuals or institutions that represent symbols of their grievances, as well as grievances based on political affiliation or perceived policy positions.""
As for white supremacy, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a February 2019 report that white nationalist groups increased by nearly 50% in a single year, ""growing from 100 chapters in 2017 to 148 in 2018.""
The FBI, which releases annual data on hate crimes, reported 7,314 hate crime incidents involving 8,559 offenses in 2019 — up from 6,121 criminal incidents and 7,321 related offenses in 2016, when Biden was vice president. That’s an increase of 19.5% in hate crimes. In 2016, 46.3% of the known offenders were white, rising to 52.5% in 2019.
At a Sept. 17 hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that ""racially motivated violent extremism"" is the largest share of domestic terrorism, and within that category those engaged in ""some kind of white supremacist-type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that.""
The United States is not alone in grappling with white supremacy, which is spreading globally.
In a 2019 terrorism report, which was issued in June, the State Department said racially or ethnically motivated terrorism, or REMT, ""in particular white supremacist terrorism, continues to be a threat to the global community, with violence both on the rise and spreading geographically, as white supremacist and nativist movements and individuals increasingly target immigrants; Jewish, Muslim, and other religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or intersex (LGBTI) individuals; governments; and other perceived enemies.""
COVID-19 Deaths
Biden, Jan. 20: It’s [COVID-19] taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.
We’re quibbling, but Biden would have been on firmer ground had he said there have been more COVID-19 deaths than ""battle deaths"" from WWII.
According to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, updated at 12:21 p.m. on Jan. 20, around the time Biden made his remarks, the U.S. had 402,997 deaths from COVID-19 so far (there is some lag in reporting). According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, there were 291,557 battle deaths in World War II. There were another 113,842 deaths among service members not in theater. That comes to 405,399 total U.S. deaths in World War II. 
Sadly, given the average number of deaths from COVID-19 in recent days, Biden’s statement will likely be true by the end of the day.
Business Closures
Biden, Jan. 20: Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.
As we’ve written, Biden does inherit an economy that has 9.8 million fewer jobs since the pre-pandemic recession peak in February. But the total number of businesses that have permanently closed due to the pandemic — as Biden’s remarks suggest — is currently unknown.
In September, Yelp, an advertising website and mobile app for local businesses, reported that a total of 163,735 businesses using its platform had closed during the pandemic, between March 1 and Aug. 31. About 60% of that total, or 97,966 closures, are believed to be permanent.
Yelp says its ""closure counts are likely an estimate of the businesses most impacted, with many others not counted because they remain open with curtailed hours and staffing, or because they have not yet updated their Yelp business pages to reflect closures."" So the data could be an underestimate of the number of short- or long-term business closures.
That same month, economics professor Steven Hamilton — using earlier figures from Yelp and Womply, a data and software company for local businesses — estimated that 420,000 small businesses in the U.S. had closed permanently by July 10.
But at this point, an estimate is all it is. An official count is unavailable.
Women’s March
Biden, Jan. 20: Here we stand where 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing in of the first woman in American history, elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don’t tell me things can’t change.
Biden was referring to the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913. On March 3, 1913, the day before President-elect Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration, more than 5,000 marchers paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue in support of women’s right to vote.
According to a Library of Congress essay on the event, ""the crowds, mostly men in town for the following day’s inauguration of Woodrow Wilson, surged into the street making it almost impossible for the marchers to pass."" According to testimony later provided in a Senate hearing, ""Women were jeered, tripped, grabbed, shoved, and many heard ‘indecent epithets’ and ‘barnyard conversation.’""
In all, 100 marchers were injured and taken to the hospital, and a troop of cavalry from Virginia was called in to control the crowd, according to the Library of Congress essay. Still, the essay notes, many of those in the parade completed the route, and the event provided the suffrage movement ""an infusion of vigor.""
The 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote, was ratified seven years later on Aug. 18, 1920. Since 1964, more women have voted in presidential elections than men.

At a rally in North Carolina, President Donald Trump claimed Joe Biden lives in ""beautiful houses all over the place"" and must be ""corrupt"" to afford such a lifestyle. Biden owns two homes and had some lucrative years in the private sector.


Trump also falsely claimed Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Kamala Harris, didn’t send him best wishes when he was stricken with COVID-19. They did. 

Trump, Oct, 15: And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician’s salary for his whole life. 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place. I haven’t seen him, but he’s a politician and you’re not supposed to live like you’ve made $20 million a year. So he’s corrupt as hell and everyone knows it.
It is true that Biden, who has long cited his middle-class identity and his roots in working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, has had a long career in public life. The Delaware Democrat was elected to the U.S. Senate at age 29 in 1972, and served until January 2009, when he began the first of two terms as vice president. He left office in January 2017 and has found some lucrative opportunities since, as many political figures do after they leave government work.
In August 2019, Forbes estimated that Biden and his wife Jill were worth $9 million. The magazine said their wealth included two Delaware homes valued at $4 million combined, cash and investments worth around $4 million, and a federal pension worth more than $1 million.
The magazine said that when Biden stepped down as vice president, he filed a financial disclosure form listing assets and liabilities worth somewhere between negative $897,000 and positive $489,000. But over the next 23 months, according to Forbes, citing tax filings, the couple made $15 million.
Forbes said Joe Biden received $2.4 million in speaking fees and $1.8 million from book tour events. It also said he brought in $775,000 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he is the Benjamin Franklin professor of practice and where he heads the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy & Global Engagement. It said Jill Biden added $700,000 in speaking fees.
The Biden/Harris website includes links to Biden’s Office of Government Ethics forms for 2019 and 2020 and his federal income tax returns for 2016. and 2018. The Washington Post detailed Biden’s post-government income in a June 2019 story on how he ""reaped millions in income since leaving the vice presidency.""
While Trump is right that Biden spent many years on a government salary, the former vice president has had some very lucrative years in the private sector. Biden doesn’t have houses ""all over the place."" He has two, including a vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. And there is no evidence he earned money through any kind of corruption.
Biden and Harris Did Extend Best Wishes
At the rally, Trump also referred to the fact that the Biden campaign had announced on Oct. 15 that Harris’ communications director and a member of her flight crew had tested positive for COVID-19. Harris canceled her campaign travel through Oct. 18 as a result.
Trump, Oct. 15: But we worry about [Harris]. I’m very concerned about her, because as you probably just heard just before I walked out, two of the people that travel with her, her chief of staff and somebody else in the plane with her all the time, they have been tested positive for COVID- 19. So we extend our best wishes, right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best, which is more than they did to me. But that’s OK. That’s OK.
In fact, both Biden and Harris had made the gesture. Harris did so via Twitter on Oct. 2, the same day Trump revealed he and the first lady had tested positive, wishing the president and First Lady Melania Trump ""a full and speedy recovery.""


Biden also tweeted on Oct. 2, wishing the first couple ""a swift recovery.""


Trump was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Oct. 2 and spent three nights there. Soon afterward he returned to the campaign trail.
On the day Trump left the hospital, Biden started a campaign speech by saying, ""And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they, like so many American families, are dealing with COVID-19.""
Correction, Dec. 22: We originally omitted the word ""Beach"" from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

      Viral Social Media Posts Offer False Coronavirus Tips

		Quick Take
Posts are circulating false and misleading tips on social media — in some cases wrongly attributed to Stanford University — about how people can monitor and avoid the coronavirus.


Full Story 
As the U.S. and countries around the world work to address the pandemic spread of COVID-19, posts disseminated by tens of thousands on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are feeding misinformation to people about how to avoid and self-test for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The posts provide a series of supposed tips about the virus, such as wrongly instructing people to hold their breath to gauge whether they’ve been infected and falsely suggesting that water consumption can kill the virus. Similar claims were promoted in a text-based image posted on the Instagram account of actress Debra Messing, which has since been deleted. They were also shared widely in screenshots on Twitter.
The posts in some cases cite ""Taiwan experts"" or ""Japanese doctors,"" and many begin by falsely sourcing the text to ""STANFORD HOSPITAL BOARD."" Stanford Health Care has debunked that attribution. 

We consulted Krys Johnson, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Temple University, who called the posts ""deeply troubling because they make incorrect and dangerous claims."" She recommended people consult the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the World Health Organization, before spreading purported health advice.
Here are some of the claims from the posts, and why they’re inaccurate:
Claim: ""Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.""



Facts: There’s no evidence to suggest this is a valid test for COVID-19. What’s more: ""We know that people infected with coronavirus show symptoms within 14 days and that this virus can lead to severe complications,"" Johnson told us via email, ""but those are acute respiratory distress (not being able to breathe) and septic shock (the virus infecting your bloodstream), not fibrosis, as mentioned here.""
The CDC recommends seeking medical advice by phone if you develop the main symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough and shortness of breath — and have been in contact with someone who has the disease, or have recently traveled to an area experiencing a spread of the virus.
Claim: ""If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold … Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.""
Facts: While the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are ""fever, tiredness, and dry cough,"" according to WHO, some patients do have ""aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea."" Some who are infected don’t show any symptoms. Also, a WHO report said that, based on an examination of more than 55,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 33% had sputum (phlegm) production.
Claim: ""Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus.""
Facts: The WHO has shot down this theory, saying that, ""[w]hile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.""
Likewise, Johnson said that the ""moistness of your mouth and throat have nothing to do with the likelihood that you will develop disease, and simply drinking water to ‘rinse’ your digestive track will not prevent you from being infected or from getting sick."" Water consumption, she added, ""has no bearing on the virus getting into your airways and lungs; if you breathe in an infected person’s respiratory droplets, the virus will travel through your airways.""
CDC officials recommend people clean their hands often, for at least 20 seconds — or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as an alternative — and avoid touching their faces and mouths. They also suggest social distancing, which can help curb the spread of the virus.
Claim: ""This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees.""
Facts: What, exactly, these posts are referencing is unclear. The CDC has said it’s ""not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19."" We’ve previously written about how it’s unknown whether warming weather will help temper the outbreak.
The WHO has said there is ""no reason to believe that this virus would behave differently in different temperatures."" Johnson noted that Italy ""has a particularly mild winter and they have had widespread transmission of COVID-19, so it is unlikely that the outside temperature will affect this disease.""
More than 125,000 people across the globe have been infected by the coronavirus, leading to more than 4,700 deaths. We’ve reported on many falsehoods and misleading statements about the new coronavirus.

		As 2020 draws to an end, we present the 10 most popular stories on our website this year. Seven of the 10 were about the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19.
Here is our list, in order:
Hospital Payments and the COVID-19 Death Count

In the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, Congress agreed to pay an additional 20% on top of traditional Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients during the public health emergency, and reimburse hospitals for treating uninsured patients with the disease (at that enhanced Medicare rate). The act further created a $100 billion fund that is being used to financially assist hospitals — a ""portion"" of which will be ""used to reimburse healthcare providers, at Medicare rates, for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured,"" according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
But there’s no evidence that COVID-19 deaths have been inflated by hospitals for profit — as some, including President Donald Trump, have suggested.
Biden’s False Claim on Trump’s Response to Coronavirus

Former Vice President Joe Biden was wrong when he said that the Trump administration made ""no effort"" to get U.S. medical experts into China as the novel coronavirus epidemic spread there early this year.
False Claims of Nationwide Lockdown for COVID-19

In March, the National Security Council warned Americans of a ""FAKE"" rumor circulating on social media that falsely claims Trump will impose a nationwide ""mandatory quarantine."" In a March 16 press briefing, the president said his administration ""may look at certain areas,"" but it is not considering anything that would affect the whole country ""at this time.""
No Link Between Harvard Scientist Charles Lieber and Coronavirus

Charles Lieber, a prominent Harvard scientist, was charged on Jan. 28 for lying about his participation in a Chinese recruitment program and his affiliation with a Chinese university. But Lieber, a nanoscientist, has no connection to the novel coronavirus — contrary to social media claims.
The Facts on Trump’s Travel Restrictions

Trump made a number of misleading statements about his decision on Jan. 31 to impose restrictions on some travelers to the United States if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks. Trump, for example, falsely referred to the travel restrictions as a ""travel ban."" There wasn’t an outright ban, as there are exceptions, including for Americans and their family members.
Sanders Didn’t Call for 52% Tax on $29,000 Incomes

A viral post claims, falsely, that Sen. Bernie Sanders at a recent debate called for a tax rate of 52% on incomes of $29,000 or more to pay for his Medicare for All plan. He didn’t. That figure was floated as a potential marginal tax rate for income above $10 million.
Trump’s H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic Spin

In tweets and other appearances, Trump has repeatedly compared his response to the new coronavirus with President Barack Obama’s handling of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. But Trump’s information is frequently incorrect or misleading — and the two viruses are very different.

The president’s address included false and misleading claims on jobs, wages, energy, immigration and more.
False Claim About CDC’s Global Anti-Pandemic Work

As the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus has spread around the world, a number of politicians, news organizations and public figures have made the false claim that the Trump administration cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s anti-pandemic work in over 40 countries to just 10. The claim appears to have been based solely on outdated news reports from early 2018 that said the CDC was preparing to dramatically reduce its work helping to prevent infectious-disease epidemics. Those hypothetical cuts were avoided, however, because Congress later provided more funding for the CDC’s global health programs, the CDC told us in a statement.
Trump Has Condemned White Supremacists

Trump drew criticism for his condemnation of ""hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides"" after a rally organized by a white nationalist in Charlottesville in 2017, and for saying there were ""very fine people on both sides."" But Biden went too far when he wrongly claimed Trump has ""yet once to condemn white supremacy, the neo-Nazis.""

		At the White House coronavirus task force press briefing on April 7, President Donald Trump distorted the facts about the person he dismissed as the chief watchdog for spending under the new pandemic relief legislation and the Wisconsin election, which took place as scheduled despite the coronavirus outbreak:

The president suggested he removed Glenn Fine as the Pentagon’s acting inspector general — preventing him from heading the pandemic relief spending oversight panel — because of Fine’s partisan background. But Fine is a career federal official who has worked under both parties.
Trump falsely claimed that Wisconsin Democrats acted at the 11th hour to postpone the state’s April 7 election after he endorsed Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly on April 3. In fact, Trump endorsed Kelly on Jan. 14; the Democratic governor acted because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pandemic Spending Watchdog
Asked to explain his decision to replace Fine, Trump started by saying he has been replacing inspectors general from ""the Obama era"" when the administration gets ""reports of bias.""
""Well, we have … IGs in from the Obama era,"" said Trump, using the common Washington shorthand for inspector general.
When he was told Fine wasn’t necessarily linked to President Barack Obama, Trump replied, ""Maybe he was from Clinton.""
In fact, Fine has worked in federal government during both Republican and Democratic administrations and does not have a reputation as a political figure, but rather as an aggressive, independent investigator.
Fine became the Justice Department’s inspector general in 2000, under President Bill Clinton, and served in that role until 2011 during both terms of Republican President George W. Bush, finishing up under Obama, like Clinton a Democrat. After four years in private practice, he returned to the federal government under Obama.
Fine was named the Defense Department’s principal deputy inspector general on June 1, 2015. He became the Pentagon’s acting inspector general the following January and has spent three-and-a-half years in the Trump administration.
Fine, co-captain of Harvard’s basketball team and a 10th-round draft choice of the San Antonio Spurs, served as special counsel to the DOJ inspector general and as director of the special investigations and review unit under Clinton from 1995 to 2000.
Fine was named chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee on March 30. The committee’s mission is to oversee how money is spent under the recently enacted $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation. The panel’s members must be inspectors general. By dismissing him from the Pentagon IG position, Trump effectively relieved Fine from leading the pandemic spending committee.
On April 8, House Democrats introduced legislation that would allow Fine, who is now the Pentagon’s principal deputy inspector general, to chair the pandemic review committee.
In announcing Fine’s appointment, Michael Horowitz, chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said, ""Mr. Fine is uniquely qualified to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, given his more than 15 years of experience as an Inspector General overseeing large organizations.""
Fine’s former boss, James Mattis, who served as defense secretary under Trump, came to Fine’s defense after he was let go.
""Mr. Fine is a public servant in the finest tradition of honest, competent governance,"" Mattis told Yahoo News in an email. ""In my years of extensive engagement with him as our Department of Defense’s acting Inspector General, he proved to be a leader whose personal and managerial integrity were always of the highest order.""
Horowitz will head a group of inspectors general who will name a new head of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Replacing Fine as the Pentagon’s acting inspector general will be Sean O’Donnell, the inspector general at the Environmental Protection Agency, who retains his current position.
An oversight mechanism for the mammoth coronavirus relief aid package was a key demand from Democrats as the bill was negotiated.
Fine is not the only inspector general to come into Trump’s sights recently.
On April 3, Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who told Congress about the whistleblower complaint, leading to Trump’s impeachment. And on April 6 Trump raised questions about Principal Deputy Inspector General Christi Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services because of her report that found shortages and testing delays at hospitals. Like Fine, Grimm is a career government official.
Wisconsin Election
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued an 11th-hour executive order to move the state’s April 7 election to June because of the coronavirus pandemic. Evers, a Democrat who had been under pressure from his own party for weeks to postpone the election, issued the order on April 6, seeking to delay the election until June 9 or a date that the governor and Republican Legislature could agree upon.
But the Republican state legislative leaders immediately went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the governor’s decision was unconstitutional. That ruling was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, allowing the election to take place on April 7.
Despite complaints of voter suppression, the election went off as planned. The state’s largest city, Milwaukee, had only five of its 180 polling places open, because of health concerns. In Green Bay, only two of its 31 polling places were open.
At his daily coronavirus press briefing, Trump said the U.S. Supreme Court properly allowed the election to take place as scheduled.
The president then falsely claimed that Wisconsin Democrats acted at the last minute to postpone the April 7 election not because of safety concerns but because he endorsed state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly ""just the other day"" on social media, referring to an April 3 tweet.
Trump, April 7: Of course they were right. Yeah. Look, the Supreme Court — well, of course they were right, because what the Democrats wanted — and you know why this happened. I supported a man named Justice Kelly, who’s — Daniel Kelly, highly respected justice. And I supported him just the other day — social media. I know of him. He’s a — just a, you know, fantastic judge, justice. And I endorsed him.
And as soon as I endorsed him, they wanted to move the election. They didn’t want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, ""Oh, let’s move the election to two months later."" They didn’t mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting.
Now they talk about, ""Oh, safety, safety."" Well, it was 15 minutes after I put out an endorsement that they said, ""We have to move the election."" They didn’t want to move the election before that.
Trump leaves the impression that his April 3 tweet set in motion a last-minute attempt by Wisconsin Democrats to delay the election. In fact, Democrats were pressuring Evers to postpone the April 7 election for weeks, but the governor resisted and instead urged voters to vote by mail ballots.
For example, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, urged the governor on March 24 to hold the election by mail and suspend in-person voting.
Also, Trump endorsed Kelly on Jan. 14 at a rally, as the state Republican Party noted in a press release a day after the rally.
Republican Party of Wisconsin, Jan. 15: In case you missed it, President Donald J. Trump endorsed Justice Daniel Kelly for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court during his ""Keep America Great"" rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday. President Trump said, ""Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to re-elect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly. Go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin.""
The press release included a video of Trump’s endorsement of Kelly.
At the time, the conservative incumbent justice was running in a three-way nonpartisan primary against two ""liberal-leaning challengers,"" as the Associated Press described the race. The top two vote-getters in the February primary – Kelly and Jill Karofsky — advanced to the general election, which was held on April 7.
The state GOP supported Kelly, who was also endorsed by the National Rifle Association and state anti-abortion groups. Karofsky, his challenger, was endorsed by the state’s top Democrats, labor unions and women’s groups.
Trump did tweet on April 3 that Kelly has his ""Complete Endorsement,"" but that was the case back on Jan. 14. There is no evidence that that tweet had anything to do with attempts to move the date of the election.

      How Many COVID-19 Tests Are ‘Needed’ to Reopen?

		The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that there are enough COVID-19 tests for states to begin reopening their economies. While that may be true for select locations, experts say more tests are needed, even if they don’t agree on a particular number.
In the past couple of weeks, President Donald Trump and other members of the coronavirus task force have insisted that there are adequate levels of diagnostic testing for the coronavirus to allow states to lift stay-at-home orders and restart some businesses.
""We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening,"" Trump said in an April 27 briefing, adding, ""And the testing is not going to be a problem at all. In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have.""
In the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said, ""[W]e have a sufficient amount of testing today for every state that qualifies to enter phase one to begin to reopen their economies."" Phase one refers to the first part of the White House’s plan for a gradual return to quasi-normal life, which allows gyms, restaurants and movie theaters, for example, to open under continued social distancing, but for schools to remain closed and workplaces to encourage telework where possible. 
The vice president’s office did not explain which metrics Pence and others were using to make that determination, so it’s hard to fully evaluate his statement. But while some places may have enough tests, multiple scientists told us that as a whole, the U.S. still lags behind what’s needed to execute an effective strategy to rein in outbreaks.
""Testing is still limited,"" Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in response to Pence’s statement. 
""If you’re not including testing as a large part of phase one opening, then sure, we have plenty of tests,"" he said. ""But I think most of us who are working on thinking about what are the safest and best ways to open up the economy again place pretty significant amounts of testing front and center to prevent outbreaks and monitor for them.""
The question of how many tests it will take is hotly debated, with some groups recommending at least around half a million tests a day, and others suggesting several million or upwards of 20 million or even 35 million a day.
According to the COVID Tracking Project, testing for the coronavirus in the U.S. has steadily improved — to around 264,000 a day, on average over the past week, up from about 217,000 tests per day on average for the week ending on April 26. But the nation is still below any of the proposed benchmarks from experts.
Those figures also mean there aren’t enough tests for every American who wants to return to work to get one, as Trump suggested in a May 5 interview with ABC News. When asked whether ""any worker who’s nervous about going back"" would have access to both diagnostic tests for the virus and antibody, or serological tests, ""right now,"" Trump replied, ""There should be no problem.""
But Yonatan Grad, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard, said the answer ""is quite clearly no,"" adding, ""we don’t yet have the capacity to offer broadly either virologic or serologic testing.""
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci told CNN’s Jake Tapper on April 28 that everyone who needs a test, ""according to the way we’re approaching the identification, isolation, contact tracing, keeping the country safe and healthy,"" should be able to get one by the end of May or the beginning of June.
""That’s what I’m being told by the people who are responsible for the testing,"" he added. ""I take them for their word.""
We’ll review several of the estimates and explain why testing is so important — but also why it’s not the only consideration for reopening businesses, schools and other places that have been largely closed for a month or more.
Wide Range of Estimates
Several groups have attempted to put a figure on how many tests are needed for the U.S. to reopen. On the lower end, researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute calculated that the U.S. would need to do approximately 500,000 tests per day, as a bare minimum, by May 1 — a figure they have since revised to 900,000 for May 15.
On the other extreme, there’s Nobel laureate and New York University economist Paul Romer’s plan to test the entire U.S. population once every two weeks, or around 25 million tests a day. He has since raised that to 35 million tests per day, or more, to include daily testing of front-line workers.
In between, Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics suggests 2 million tests per day to start, then ramping up to at least 5 million tests per day by early June to get the full workforce back in action — with that growing to as many as 20 million tests per day.
The 5-million-a-day figure has received perhaps the most attention, in part because when asked about the number on April 28, the president claimed the U.S. would hit that goal ""very soon.""
That morning, however, Adm. Brett Giroir, who is in charge of the government’s COVID-19 testing efforts, told Time magazine that ""there is absolutely no way on Earth, on this planet or any other planet, that we can do 20 million tests a day, or even five million tests a day."" 
A day later, Trump insisted that he had never made such a claim. ""I think we will,"" he said, referring to hitting the 5-million-per-day benchmark, ""but I never said it.""
There isn’t a consensus on the number of tests, in part because the groups are making different assumptions and taking different approaches to tackling the pandemic on different timelines. Key to all of the strategies, however, is using testing to identify people who are infected so that they can be isolated and no longer spread the virus to others. 
Many public health experts endorse testing combined with contact tracing, which involves tracking down others with whom the infected person had contact, so that those people can be warned, and ideally be put into quarantine or be tested as well.
""Without ubiquitous testing — testing everyone with symptoms, and those they have come in contact with — we simply cannot be confident that a reported decline in cases represents a true decline in infections – and that it’s safe to open,"" explained Ashish Jha, faculty director of Harvard Global Health Institute, or HGHI, and a co-author of the group’s estimates, in a Time editorial. ""If a state misjudges its true underlying infection trajectory, it may suffer large flare-ups of the disease, necessitating a long and painful lockdown again.""
The HGHI estimates were calculated in two main ways. In the first, the team followed a strategy of testing everyone with flu-like symptoms and the contacts of those who test positive. Assuming that 1% of cases prove fatal, the group worked backward from a projected number of deaths to estimate the number of new infections in the U.S. on a given day, which for May 15, is about 100,000. To then approximate the number of tests, the group assumed that three-fourths of those people would have symptoms and be tested, and each person would have 10 contacts to trace.
Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher on the HGHI team, told us the team looked through the literature to determine the number of contacts, and ended up choosing a ""middle-of-the-road estimate.""
Then the group added in the typical number of influenza-like illness cases for the season, reaching a total of around 900,000 tests per day. A similar calculation, based on trying to get the percentage of positive tests below 10% — in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization — produced a similar figure.
The researchers, however, caution that their approach in every way veers toward an undercount, and therefore should be viewed as a ""floor, not a goal.""
""If we don’t ramp up our testing,"" said Tsai, ""we’re just condemned to repeating the mistakes of both February, March and April.""
The Harvard Safra figures, which were based on modeling efforts described in two white papers, assume an intensive testing, isolation and contact tracing approach.
Danielle Allen, the director of the center and co-author of the group’s April 20 report, told us the numbers were generated by aiming to have each infected person spread the disease to less than one other person (specifically 0.75 people), which would allow the outbreak to eventually fizzle out.
With just essential workers, or about 40% of the workforce in action, the group estimated the U.S. would need 2 million tests per day, rising to 5 million for 100% of the workforce.
""Both of these numbers depend on effective contact tracing,"" Allen said. ""If contact tracing is moderately effective the amount of testing needed rises to 20 million a day.""
Allen, however, said that with subsequent modeling, the group now thinks 5 million tests per day may be sufficient, and is planning to revise the numbers in a forthcoming report.
Two other groups, also adopting a contact tracing strategy, offer other testing benchmarks. The Rockefeller Foundation suggests an initial 3 million tests per week, or about 430,000 tests per day, by mid-June, then growing that number 10-fold over another six months.
Resolve to Save Lives, a public health initiative headed by former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, tallied up the number of highest-priority people who need tests, and came up with a lower bound number of 350,000 to 700,000 tests per day. This includes high-risk patients with COVID-19 symptoms and any sick hospital workers, public safety officers, prisoners, or nursing home residents and their symptomatic contacts.
""The minimum number of tests that need to be done per day,"" the group’s report notes, ""will depend on the stage of the epidemic and number of outbreaks, hospitalization rates, number of cases and contacts identified, and decisions about the frequency and extent of testing in nursing homes, hospitals, and essential services.""
If contact tracing is not part of the equation, even more tests are needed because the approach becomes an untargeted national surveillance method. Because diagnostic testing only reveals whether someone has detectable virus in their body at one point in time, tests must be given to pretty much everyone repeatedly to ensure those who are infected are aware and can be isolated. 
That’s how one arrives at the even higher figures, such as Romer’s 25-million-per-day goal. Instead of prioritizing people who are sick, as is being done now — and is recommended in the vast majority of proposals — Romer’s plan calls for tests to go first to people without symptoms to pick out those who are spreading the virus unwittingly.
State-Specific Thresholds
While most of the test estimates are for the entire country, the reality is that for any targeted testing strategy — which is the only strategy that’s currently possible — locations with relatively few infections won’t need as much testing as places with huge outbreaks.
""You can’t just take the national number and scale it to states by their population,"" HGHI’s Jha told the health news website STAT, in a story sharing an updated state-by-state breakdown of the group’s original estimate. ""You have to base it on the size of the outbreak in a state.""
The latest figures from HGHI show that just nine states, the majority of which are clustered in the sparsely-populated West, are close to or have surpassed their testing targets. The analysis also reveals that even states that have been performing a large number of tests per capita, such as Rhode Island and Massachusetts, are still short of their estimated minimums. Conversely, some states that have relatively low per-capita testing rates, such as Hawaii and Alaska, are exceeding their targets.
Because the estimates were made using a model that assumed states would stay locked down until May 15, the researchers caution that states could very well need more tests than their calculations suggest if social distancing measures are loosened.
""The moment you relax, the number of cases will start climbing,"" Jha noted in the group’s write-up of the project. ""And therefore, the number of tests you need to keep your society, your state from having large outbreaks will also start climbing.""
None of the other estimates provide state-level figures, although Allen said the Harvard Safra group plans to release another report breaking down its national numbers ""to make visible what is necessary in high prevalence, low prevalence, and no prevalence locales.""
Test Positivity
Short of a specific test threshold, one metric experts say can get at whether a country or state is doing something close to enough testing is the test positivity rate.
Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told us that it’s ""very difficult to say what the ‘right’ number"" of tests is, but because a high fraction of tests are still positive, ""it is clear we need more capacity.""
As a Johns Hopkins website explains, if a large proportion of tests are positive, that suggests a community is only able to test the sickest patients, and is likely missing people with milder infections who can still spread the disease.
The WHO has said that countries doing extensive testing see around 3-12% of tests come back positive, and has recommended that nations aim for or a test positivity of roughly 10% to make sure there’s enough testing happening to detect all of the cases. 
As of May 8, about 15% of all tests in the U.S. have been positive, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. In the last few days, the current test positivity rate has begun to dip below 10%, although many states have a significantly higher percentage of positive tests.
""I prefer positivity to numbers of tests or tests per capita because positivity is tied to the burden of disease in a location,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in an email.
Nuzzo noted, for example, that the U.S. has conducted around 10 times as many tests per capita as Taiwan, but the American epidemic is some 200 times bigger.
And she has concerns about many states that are thinking of or have already reopened. ""[W]e’ve found that a number of these [states] aren’t doing enough testing and have too high positivities,"" she said. ""This makes me worried that they are missing the bottom of the iceberg in terms of infections and not seeing the full picture of illness in their communities.""
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, agreed that per-capita test numbers are ""not as informative as looking at testing per positive infection identified."" 
The U.S., he said, has done only about six tests per confirmed case, whereas South Korea has done 60. ""They’re testing 10 times as many per infection found,"" he said in an interview.
This is especially relevant because Trump has frequently boasted of the total number of tests the U.S. has performed, and has suggested that the U.S. is outpacing South Korea and other nations. 
Speaking in Arizona on May 5, Trump said, ""We’re over 7 million tests. Germany is at two and a half. Italy is less than that. Japan is down here and South Korea, which we talk about, and again, I’m very friendly with South Korea, and with the president of South Korea, and he calls to congratulate us on our great testing. South Korea is over here.""
Trump is correct that the U.S. has done more total testing, but all of the other countries he mentioned have still performed more tests per positive case, meaning they’ve been able to do more testing relative to the size of their outbreaks.
The next day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany again referenced South Korea. ""We always hear about South Korea and their tests, there are 11 tests per thousand,"" she said. ""Here in the United States, that’s 17 tests per thousand.""
McEnany’s statistics are slightly off — for May 4, Our World in Data shows South Korea with 12 tests per thousand people and the U.S. with 22. 
But again, the comparison is misleading because it ignores the fact, as we have previously written, that South Korea rapidly expanded testing early on in the outbreak. Ultimately, the country was able to successfully halt its outbreak — something the U.S. has failed to do.
On May 8, the country posted just 12 new cases, while the U.S. is still seeing around 25,000 new infections per day, or approximately 325 times more cases than South Korea when adjusted for the population. It took months — until April 17 — for the U.S. to catch up to South Korea’s per-capita testing level, and the U.S. has yet to match the nation’s less than 2% test positivity rate. South Korea doesn’t need to compete with the U.S. on per-capita tests because the country is already doing a massive amount of testing compared to its caseload.
Contact Tracing
While experts say increased testing is a requirement for reopening, they also emphasize that by itself, it’s not enough.
""What’s more important now is not so much the testing number,"" said HGHI’s Tsai. ""It’s really the testing strategy and transparency around the goalposts as states come up with their specific plans for reopening.""
A key question is whether states will be able to snuff out new chains of viral transmission through contact tracing, as many experts advise. While a staple of public health, contact tracing is a resource-intensive process, and involves not just piecing together an infected person’s contacts, but also providing support to those who are quarantined or isolated.
""They may need food. They may need medicines,"" said Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, on a call with journalists. ""They may need help with simple things like doing their laundry.""
Gurley contributed to a report, written in collaboration with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, that estimated the U.S. would need to add around 100,000 contact tracers to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
While Shaman thinks contact tracing is absolutely critical, he noted that South Korea was exceptionally well set-up to make the technique more effective.
Following an outbreak of MERS in 2015, he said, the country passed laws that allowed the government to monitor people’s credit cards and phones — and also to arrest anyone refusing to participate in a quarantine.
Those levers aren’t available in the U.S., and privacy concerns may keep at bay proposals to deploy more scalable technology-based contact tracing tools.
Other scientists are pessimistic that contact tracing will work in the U.S., especially if case numbers remain high.
""It’s clear that you can do a lot of control if you do contact tracing really well. Singapore managed with mainly contact tracing for several months,"" said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, in a call with reporters. ""But then eventually even Singapore lost its control of the epidemic and had to resort to social distancing types of measures.""
""In conjunction with really aggressive measures to get case numbers down — and significant resources — contact tracing can be a useful piece of the control approach,"" he added. ""But I think it’s very challenging with an ongoing epidemic.""
According to a New York Times analysis, 21 states are planning to or have already begun to reopen, even though they have not cleared all of the criteria set forth by the White House guidelines. Most of the states do not meet the gating criteria for COVID-19 cases, which can be met by showing either a ""downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period"" or a ""downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period."" 
Opening before states have solid testing infrastructures and strategies that they know are working, Tsai said, would be premature. ""It’s basically just turning back the hands of time to February,"" he said.

		In this video, we explore the existing research on face masks as tools to limit the spread of infectious diseases and explain why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its stance on whether people who aren’t sick need to cover their faces.

In the initial months following the outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the novel coronavirus — the CDC cautioned against widespread face mask use, recommending masks only for people who were ill or those who were treating them.
But on April 3, in light of new evidence that a ""significant portion"" of infected people spread the virus to others even when they don’t have symptoms, the agency began recommending that people use cloth face coverings anytime they leave their homes and can’t stay six feet away from other people. 
The shifting advice was welcomed by some experts, who say cloth face coverings are likely to be better than nothing. Masks are thought to primarily prevent people from spewing infectious droplets from their noses and mouths and infecting others.
But other experts have reservations, given a lack of clinical trials that demonstrate surgical masks are useful in the general population. And there are concerns that the new guidelines could exacerbate shortages of medical masks for the health care workers who need them most — or backfire if people don’t wear their coverings properly or are lulled into a false sense of security.
Despite the debate, experts agree that medical masks need to be prioritized for health care workers and that it’s still best for people to stay home. As the CDC says, cloth coverings are ""not a substitute"" for social distancing.
For more information about face masks and what the research and experts think about their use during the COVID-19 pandemic, see our story, ""COVID-19 Face Mask Advice, Explained.""

		SciCheck Digest
Japan only recently adopted guidelines for accepting blood donations from those who have received COVID-19 vaccines. The guidelines are intended to give donors time to get over any side effects from the vaccine. Without providing that context, a social media post misleadingly claims Japan is ""refusing"" blood donations from vaccinated people.

              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
Japan has reported more than 651,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 11,000 deaths, and is in the midst of a fourth wave of infections. Yet it lags far behind many other nations in vaccinating its population against the novel coronavirus.
With just 2% of the population fully inoculated – compared to more than 35% in the U.S. – Japan ""is on a par with Myanmar – a failed state,"" Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University’s Japan campus, told us in an email.
Late to the game while waiting for a homegrown vaccine that did not materialize, Japan has approved only one vaccine — the Pfizer/BioNTech shot — for the country and has been slow getting it into people’s arms.
""A labyrinthine approval process hasn’t helped,"" William Pesek, a Tokyo resident and author of ""Japanization: What the World Can Learn from Japan’s Lost Decades,"" wrote in the Washington Post. ""Tradition-bound Tokyo has long required pharmaceutical companies to do soup-to-nuts clinical trials locally, rather than incorporating studies and data done elsewhere.""
He also noted the relatively low death rate in a nation of 126 million has reduced a sense of urgency, and a ""lively"" anti-vaccine movement is spreading skepticism in Japan. There have been about 8.75 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in Japan compared with nearly 178 per 100,000 in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
In the midst of this, a post on Facebook has started spreading in the U.S., misleadingly claiming, ""JAPAN refuses blood donations from any who received shot/s! Wow… What’s that tell you?!""
But Japan has not been refusing to accept blood donations from vaccinated individuals; it simply put them on hold while the government drew up donor guidelines.
Hitoshi Hatta, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., told FactCheck.org in an email on May 7 that the Health Ministry recently adopted guidelines calling for ""people not to donate blood within (only) 48 hours after vaccination for Covid-19.""
He said in a telephone interview that the delay has nothing to do with concerns about the vaccine’s safety, but is intended to give would-be donors time to get over any possible side effects from the vaccine. Side effects can include dizziness, fever and body aches, and would preclude them from giving blood.
The Japanese Red Cross Society posted the government recommendations on April 28, but said it would not put them into effect until May 14.
The guidelines come as Japan is also dealing with a blood shortage due to a drop in donations in the face of pandemic shutdowns.
What impact the slow rollout of the vaccine will have for the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in July is not yet clear. But Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, facing another wave of COVID-19 infections in the country, on May 7 extended the state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures until May 31 and expanded it to Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures.
One thing working in favor of the Olympics going ahead is that, except for athletes and participants, no foreigners can enter the country to attend.
Kingston, of Temple’s Japan campus, told FactCheck.org that the lagging rollout of the vaccine and the delay in the blood donation guidelines are the government’s making.
""It’s a bureaucratic bottleneck driven by fear that something might go wrong, so best to delay and delay,"" he said.
Kingston said Japan also has not forgotten a scandal that enraged the nation in the 1980s, after it became known that some government officials allowed continued use of blood contaminated with the HIV virus after it had been established that heat treatments would have prevented the spread of the infection through donated blood. Takeshi Abe, who had led the Health Ministry’s AIDS research team at the time, was charged with attempted murder in 1996 but was acquitted in 2001.
In the U.S., there is no wait time, or deferral as it is known, to donate blood under Food and Drug Administration guidelines for those who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. But the FDA, anticipating the development of live attenuated vaccines — which use a weakened form of the virus to provide protection — has already suggested a two-week deferral for anyone inoculated with any of those vaccines.
According to the World Health Organization, live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines are in pre-clinical development at the University of North Carolina.
Dr. Julie Katz Karp, director of transfusion medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, said the FDA decided early on that there would be no deferral for blood donations for those inoculated with the three authorized vaccines now in use in the U.S.
""They recognized that the risk to the recipient was essentially – as far as we could tell from a scientific perspective – nothing,"" she said.
(See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,"" ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine."")
Karp said the medical directors of blood banks still have it within their own power to require vaccine recipients to delay giving blood if they see fit.
She said deferral periods have two key purposes. One is to protect the donor, and the other to ensure the recipient gets a safe blood product that has ""good potency, good purity and good efficacy.""
For example, donors with low hemoglobin counts will get deferrals in the interest of both themselves and a possible recipient, while those with low blood pressure will have to wait for their own safety until they can give blood.
She said deferral periods ""vary widely"" around the world and are judgments made by local officials based on reasons ranging from medical to cultural to even storage capacity. She said the U.S., where one can give blood every 56 days, tends to be more aggressive, while others are more conservative. For example, in Japan a man can only give blood three times a year, while for women it is twice a year.
And in terms of vaccine-related deferrals, India only recently has reduced its period from 28 days to two weeks at the request of blood banks.
The demand for blood in the U.S. dipped during the pandemic as hospitals put off elective surgeries and accidents ebbed, Karp said, but it is nearing pre-pandemic levels and with it, the need for more donations.

A World Health Organization advisory group has concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine ""is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above,"" and is specifically recommending it for children ages 12 to 15 who are at high risk of severe COVID-19. The WHO did not say ""stop giving kids the vaxx immediately,"" as some have claimed online.

              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
The World Health Organization said the English version of its COVID-19 advice page for the public was updated on June 22 to reflect more recent interim recommendations that WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts released June 15.
Importantly, WHO’s updated guidance said that its advisory group ""has concluded that the Pfizer/BionTech vaccine is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above.""
As of June 25, the page stated:
WHO COVID-19 Vaccines Advice page, June 25: Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, so unless they are part of a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers.
More evidence is needed on the use of the different COVID-19 vaccines in children to be able to make general recommendations on vaccinating children against COVID-19.
The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has concluded that the Pfizer/BionTech vaccine is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above. Children aged between 12 and 15 who are at high risk may be offered this vaccine alongside other priority groups for vaccination. Vaccine trials for children are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation warrants a change in policy.
So, the WHO says the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may be used for children 12 and up. And out of concern for countries where the vaccine supply is still very low — not concern about the safety of the vaccine — the WHO recommends the shots be prioritized for individuals age 12 to 15 who are at high risk for COVID-19, specifically.
For the other available COVID-19 vaccines, the WHO says more information is needed before it can recommend their use for children and adolescents.
But the WHO’s seven-day delay in posting the update caused confusion online.
Some social media posts falsely claimed that ""WHO is now recommending that children DO NOT get the COVID-19 vaccine,"" and that the WHO said ""stop giving kids the vaxx immediately.""
Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene also tweeted June 22, ""The WHO says ‘children should not be vaccinated.'""
Such claims were based on outdated guidance that was still on the WHO’s English advice page before it was updated June 22.
As of at least June 21, that page said:
WHO COVID-19 Vaccines Advice page, June 21:
Children should not be vaccinated for the moment.
There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults. However, children should continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines.""
That led at least one website to misleadingly report: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) published revised advice on June 21, 2021, clarifying which populations should receive COVID-19 vaccines. The WHO’s website now states, ‘Children should not be vaccinated for the moment.'""

That wasn’t new guidance, as that story suggested. That language had been used on the page since at least early April, according to archived versions of the page.
In North America, it wasn’t until May 5 that Canada authorized the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 12 to 15 years of age. Then the U.S. Food and Drug Administration followed with its own expanded authorization of the vaccine for that age group on May 10. (Canada and the U.S. had previously authorized use of the vaccine for people 16 and older in December 2020.)
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts met May 27 to propose recommendations to the WHO on the use of COVID-19 vaccines, and SAGE’s interim guidance on the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines was released June 15.
As it relates to vaccines for children, the guidance documents for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines advise against use for individuals under age 18, as more information on those vaccines’ safety and efficacy in children is still needed.
However, the guidance document for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, or BNT162b2, said:
WHO interim guidance on the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, June 15: For children and adolescents COVID-19 is rarely severe. Evidence suggests that adolescents, particularly older adolescents, are as likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 as adults. WHO recommends that countries should consider using BNT162b2 in children aged 12 to 15 only when high vaccine coverage with 2 doses has been achieved in the high priority groups as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.
Children 12-15 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID-19 disease, alongside other high-risk groups, may be offered vaccination.
There are currently no efficacy or safety data for children below the age of 12 years. Until such data are available, individuals below 12 years of age should not be routinely vaccinated.
But those recommendations weren’t added to the WHO’s advice page until June 22, after social media posts based on the out-of-date guidance went viral.
So far, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the only COVID-19 immunization authorized for children 12 and older in the U.S., although Moderna completed a trial and submitted its application for this age group to the Food and Drug Administration on June 10. Both companies are conducting additional trials in younger children as well.

		SciCheck Digest
Federal health officials testified at a Senate committee hearing that about 60% of their employees have been vaccinated against COVID-19 so far. But viral online posts have distorted their comments to misleadingly claim that half of the employees ""are refusing"" the vaccines. The officials did not say anyone had refused to get vaccinated.

Full Story
There are three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. that have all received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. More than 279 million vaccine doses had been administered in the U.S. and 60.5% of adults had received at least one shot as of May 21. (See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,"" ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine."")
On May 11, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, testified at a Senate committee hearing on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Questioned by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina about the number of their employees who have received COVID-19 vaccines, Fauci estimated that ""around 60%"" of NIAID staff have been vaccinated and Marks said a similar percentage of FDA employees have been vaccinated.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also testified before the Senate committee but did not state how many CDC employees have been vaccinated.
But since then, viral social media posts and digital stories have distorted what Fauci, Marks and Walensky said.
The headline on an article that claims more than 18,000 views on WeLoveTrump.com reads, ""Half of CDC, NIH, and FDA Employees Refused the Experimental COVID-19 Jabs."" (Along with twisting Fauci’s words, the headline misrepresents his government position. He is director of NIAID, which is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health.)
A similar Instagram post shows a screenshot of a now-deleted tweet posted by the account @Breaking911 reading, ""NEW: About 40-50% of CDC, FDA employees are refusing the COVID-19 vaccine according to Fauci, Marks.""
The percentages in these claims distort the health officials’ responses to say that ""40-50%"" of their employees have ""refused"" the vaccine.
While reviewing ongoing COVID-19 prevention measures and guidance during the Senate committee hearing, Burr posed the question to Fauci, Marks and Walensky.
Burr, May 11: This question, I’m going to go to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Marks, and Dr. Walensky. What percentage of the employees in your institute, your center, or your agency, of your employees, has been vaccinated?
Fauci: I’m not 100% sure, Senator, but I think it’s probably a little bit more than half, probably around 60%.
Burr: Dr. Marks?
Marks: I can’t tell you the exact number, but it’s probably in the same range. Some people vaccinated at our facility, and others outside of the facility.
Burr: Dr. Walensky?
Walensky: We’re encouraging our employees to get vaccinated. We’ve been doing town halls and education seminars. Our staff have the option to report their vaccination status, but as you understand, the federal government is not requiring it, so we do not know.

None of the federal health officials said members of their staff refused to get COVID-19 vaccines.
An FDA spokeswoman told us in an email: ""The post’s suggestion that a majority of staff have refused to get their vaccine is absolutely false. The FDA is offering COVID-19 vaccines to employees and we know employees are also choosing to receive vaccines through local, state or privately operated vaccination sites. Because the FDA does not mandate vaccinations or require staff to report their vaccinations, we do not know the exact percentage of our staff who have not yet been vaccinated, but we have been encouraged to hear from the large number of our staff who have chosen to be vaccinated.""
We reached out to the CDC and NIAID to clarify if any employees were refusing vaccines, but did not hear back. We will update this article if we get a response.
Update, May 28: After we published our article, the NIAID sent us a statement that said Fauci ""did not say that 40 to 50% are refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine."" The statement continued: ""To our knowledge, the percentage of NIH staff who have received a vaccine at NIH or self-reported receiving a vaccine in the community is close to 67%. The actual number may be higher since self-reporting is voluntary and there may be staff who received the vaccine in the community but have not reported it to us.""

		In this video, we review some of the claims Sen. Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence made during the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7.


Harris falsely claimed Trump’s China trade war cost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. The U.S. gained 146,000 factory jobs during the first 18 months after the tariffs took effect.
Pence suggested that it’s unknown what is causing climate change. But scientists have a very good idea of what’s causing climate change: humans.
Harris said President Donald Trump had called the coronavirus ""a hoax."" Trump said he was referring to Democrats finding fault with his administration’s response to the coronavirus, not the virus itself.
Pence repeated the false claim that the Obama administration left the Strategic National Stockpile ""empty."" 
Pence claimed that Biden and Harris ""want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking."" Biden’s climate change plan calls for a ban on new permitting on public land; most fracking occurs in non-public areas.

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System accepts any reports of adverse side effects following vaccination to help regulators detect potential problems. Anyone can submit a report, whether or not the incident is vaccine-related. Fox News host Tucker Carlson misrepresented the VAERS data to suggest that thousands have died from COVID-19 vaccines.

              How safe are the vaccines?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              Hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain — or no side effects at all. As the CDC has said, these vaccines ""have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.""
A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated.
As of Jan. 18, there have been 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those who develop anaphylaxis are usually given epinephrine, the drug found in EpiPens. None of these reactions has led to death. On Feb. 26, Johnson & Johnson said it had received a report of one anaphylactic reaction in South Africa.
To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn’t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, primarily in women ages 18 to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.
As of July 12, the syndrome has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine. There have been three deaths linked to the condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
In April, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use"" of the vaccine to investigate six reports of the syndrome out of more than 6.8 million immunizations. After a review, which turned up nine more cases, the CDC and FDA determined that the benefits still outweigh the risks and that the pause should be lifted. A warning was nevertheless added to the vaccine’s fact sheet and the CDC has said that women younger than 50 years old ""especially should be aware"" of the condition and that ""that there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen."" The condition is still rare among the highest-risk group, occurring in around 7 of every million vaccinated adult women below the age of 50.
On July 13, the FDA added warnings to fact sheets on the J&J vaccine about an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
The agency said the chance of developing the syndrome is ""very low"" but advised J&J vaccine recipients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms including weakness or tingling, particularly in the legs or arms; difficulty walking or with facial movement; double vision; or bladder control or bowel function issues.
The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases, with most people reporting symptoms within 42 days of vaccination. One death was reported, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine. The FDA said that each year 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome and most recover fully.
There is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men. In late June, after a review of safety monitoring data, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and the two conditions in teens and young adults.
As of July 12, the agency says there have been 1,047 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years old or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which are through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, are with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and are more common among males and after the second dose.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, the committee said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.""

Full Story
More than 266 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S. and most of the reported side effects have been minor.
But Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested to his 3.3 million viewers on May 6 that more than 3,000 people have died from the COVID-19 vaccines. ""The actual number is almost certainly higher than that,"" he said. ""Perhaps vastly higher than that.""
Social media posts then spread this claim further.
But the claim is based on a misrepresentation of data collected by federal agencies that use it to identify potential safety issues with vaccines. The system that collects the data is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, and anyone can submit a report, even if it’s not clear that a vaccine caused the problem.
We took a look at the details in some of the cases reported in the VAERS system.
For example, one case that was included in Carlson’s count was for an 85-year-old senior home resident who died on Dec. 29. This was what was reported to VAERS: ""My grandmother died a few hours after receiving the moderna covid vaccine booster 1. While I don?t expect that the events are related, the treating hospital did not acknowledge this and I wanted to be sure a report was made.""
Another report included in Carlson’s count was for a woman who was vaccinated on Jan. 9, had a car accident two weeks later, and died with a brain hemorrhage nine days after that.
Another report was for a 17-year-old who killed himself with a gun eight days after he was vaccinated.
This doesn’t mean that no deaths could be related to the vaccines. But these examples make it clear that ""VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine,"" as the Department of Health and Human Services explains.
Doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration review every case of death as soon as it is reported to VAERS.
As we said, the CDC and FDA use the database to detect patterns of potential vaccine-related adverse events, which is what happened in April when regulators flagged reports of rare instances of blood clots in women under 50 who had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The agencies then recommended pausing distribution of the vaccine to investigate the rare and dangerous clotting condition. When they recommended resuming its use, the agencies a warning for women under 50.
As of May 11, according to the CDC, more than 9 million doses of the J&J vaccine had been given, and there were 28 confirmed reports of the clotting syndrome. The CDC has said that its review of the information in those cases ""has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.""
The bottom line is that it’s wrong to suggest that reported deaths in the VAERS database were all caused by vaccines. That’s not the case. We’ve written before about similar falsehoods that misrepresent the information in VAERS.
In his case, though, Carlson took that misrepresentation further. He suggested that the already inflated number of deaths is even higher.
""A report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2010 concluded that ‘fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported by the VAERS system,'"" he said. ""Fewer than 1%. So what is the real number of people who apparently have been killed or injured by the vaccines?""
But that report — which analyzed the use of an automated system for tracking health changes following vaccination rather than relying on the current system of purely voluntary reports — didn’t explain how it calculated that percentage and, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the degree of underreporting in VAERS varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms.
""‘Underreporting’ is one of the main limitations of passive surveillance systems, including VAERS,"" HHS says on its website. The department then gives the example of injection-site soreness, which is one of the most common events to follow vaccination, but represents few of the reports to VAERS.
""On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes,"" the site says.
A recent study by CDC scientists also found that reporting to VAERS was relatively high for some of the more serious events that can follow vaccination, such as anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
""VAERS sensitivity for capturing anaphylaxis after seven different vaccines ranged from 13 to 76%; sensitivity for capturing GBS after three different vaccines ranged from 12 to 64%,"" the study found.
Carlson also injected some conspiratorial thinking into his segment, saying, ""Some people say, ‘well it’s just a coincidence that someone gets a shot and then dies, possibly from other causes.’ No one really knows, is the truth.""
Actually, the point of the VAERS system is to alert federal agencies to potential problems so they can investigate. For reported deaths, HHS says CDC and FDA doctors in each case review ""available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records.""
A Fox spokeswoman we talked to declined to answer whether or not Carlson has been vaccinated against COVID-19.

		In a meeting at the White House, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar left the misleading impression that the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to revoke its emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 ""removes a potential barrier"" and makes it easier to access the drugs. The FDA’s action does the opposite.
Following Azar’s lead, President Donald Trump also falsely accused a journalist of asking a ""very inaccurately stated question"" about the FDA’s emergency use authorization, or EUA, and continued to point to unscientific anecdotal evidence to insist that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, despite growing evidence to the contrary.
The FDA announced on June 15 that it had revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine because the drugs are ""unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,"" and that the ""known and potential benefits"" of the drugs ""no longer outweigh"" the risks — which can include ""serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.""
The FDA had issued the EUA back in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile ""when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.""
But accumulating evidence, including a large randomized controlled trial that the agency cited in its decision, has found that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Other trials also indicate that the drug does not prevent the disease if given shortly after exposure to the coronavirus.
The political spin began at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House when a journalist asked Trump to respond to news of the FDA’s revocation. The reporter paraphrased the agency as saying the drugs were ""no longer considered reasonable as a useful treatment for COVID."" 
Trump has misleadingly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a potential ""game changer,"" despite its health risks and unproven use as a COVID-19 treatment.
Azar said that the reporter’s question was not ""quite accurate"" because the FDA’s finding only applied to hospitalized patients. He then proceeded to suggest that revoking the EUA was a good thing because it removes a ""significant misunderstanding"" that the drug could only be used in a hospital setting.
The secretary stressed that the drug can still be prescribed for off-label use to treat COVID-19, saying the FDA’s decision ""actually removes a potential barrier to that.""
Azar, June 15: At this point, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are just like any other approved drug in the United States. They may be used in hospital, they may be used in out-patient, they may be used at home — all subject to a doctor’s prescription. In fact, the FDA’s removal of the emergency use authorization takes away what had been a significant misunderstanding by many that had made people think that somehow it could only be used in a hospital setting. And we’ve tried to make that clear throughout.
It’s a drug. It’s approved in the United States. Has been for decades. If a doctor wishes to prescribe it, working with a patient, they may prescribe it for any purpose that they wish to do so.  And this actually removes a potential barrier to that.
Trump: So it actually un-complicates it —
Azar: It does.
Trump: — in a way. And I think that’s probably — your question was a very inaccurately stated question.
Reporter: No, I didn’t mean to — I didn’t mean to pose it inaccurately. I believe what it said specifically was that it’s no longer reasonable to consider it an appropriate treatment.
Azar: Only in the hospital. It said the data in the hospital setting was not supported. We continue to study in outpatient settings, as well as preventive. That data is not yet in.
While it’s true that the FDA’s decision only pertains to hospitalized patients, the reporter’s phrasing is very similar to that used in the agency’s own revocation letter.
""FDA has concluded that, based on this new information and other information discussed in the attached memorandum, it is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,"" wrote FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton.
Rachel Sachs, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor, told us in a phone interview that the ""reasonable"" language, which both the reporter and the FDA used, is part of the statute governing how the FDA can issue EUAs. 
""One of the things that the FDA has to find when it grants an EUA is that it’s reasonable to believe that the drug in question is effective for the treatment of the condition,"" she said. ""And so what the FDA is saying now is that based on the weight of the evidence, it’s no longer reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine is effective for the treatment of COVID.""
In the letter, the agency toggles between statements that are specific to hospitalized patients and others that are more general. For instance, the FDA says that upon a second review of the in vitro studies that first suggested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have an ability to combat the coronavirus, it now believes the suggested doses ""are unlikely to produce an antiviral effect.""
It also notes that the earlier studies that found the drugs might decrease the amount of virus patients shed ""have not been consistently replicated,"" and that a randomized controlled trial that more rigorously tested the idea found no difference between the proportion of those taking hydroxychloroquine and those getting the standard of care in testing negative for the virus.
That’s in addition to national guidelines that now do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside of a clinical trial, including the National Institutes of Health guidelines, which recommend against the use of the drugs outside of a trial.
Several experts expressed bafflement that Azar — and then Trump — would object to the reporter’s question.
""That’s exactly what the FDA said,"" said Dr. Neil Schluger, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Columbia University who has studied hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. ""Azar’s being very misleading in that statement.""
""I thought the reporter’s question was perfect,"" said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania with expertise in FDA regulation. ""If Azar was doing his job as a public health official, he wouldn’t have chided the reporter for how he asked the question.""
FDA Decision Doesn’t Remove ‘Potential Barrier’
Perhaps more critically, experts balked at Azar’s suggestion that removing the EUA was lifting a ""potential barrier"" on hydroxychloroquine’s use, when in fact, the move reduces access to the drug by eliminating the option of getting it from the national stockpile.
""He’s somehow implying that the EUA made people think you could only use this to treat COVID-19 for hospitalized patients, and now that they’ve removed the EUA, you could use it to treat COVID patients anywhere,"" Schluger said of hydroxychloroquine in a phone interview. ""It’s exactly the opposite of that.""
Azar is correct to say that because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are FDA-approved to treat other conditions, including malaria — and in the case of hydroxychloroquine, rheumatoid diseases — they can be prescribed to COVID-19 patients in what’s called off-label prescribing. 
But that has always been true. The EUA never changed that, and the revocation also does not change that.
""The EUA had no impact on whether physicians could prescribe the drug off-label, whether patients could receive it off-label,"" said Sachs. ""It just made it easier for hospital-based providers to obtain the drug from the stockpile and to administer it to their patients.""
It’s useful to consider exactly what the initial EUA did in the first place. As Fernandez Lynch explained, the goal was to provide a supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile, based on the limited evidence at the time that the drugs might work against the coronavirus.
While chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that can be prescribed off-label, the specific chloroquine tablets donated to the stockpile were not actually FDA-approved for any use. On top of that, interstate commerce laws prevent distribution of drugs for unapproved uses, which meant that both drugs could not be legally dispensed from the national stockpile for COVID-19.
To make that distribution legal, the FDA needed to issue an EUA, which the agency decided to limit to hospitalized patients outside of clinical trials.
Azar’s argument appears to be that that specification confused people, leading some to think that the drug more broadly could only be prescribed to hospitalized patients — and that by revoking the entire EUA, that restriction was lifted.
But Sachs said that line of thinking doesn’t hold water. 
""I certainly have no evidence to support the claim that people believed hydroxychloroquine was only available in the hospital setting, and that now a barrier to its use was removed,"" she said. ""Sec. Azar’s framing sounds like what the FDA is doing is opening up hydroxychloroquine for broader use. But that’s actually not what’s going on — they’re actually restricting one avenue for its use by withdrawing the EUA.""
Fernandez Lynch agreed, saying it was misleading for Azar to characterize the EUA revocation as a kind of easing on hydroxychloroquine.
""What they did was take away the EUA because the evidence no longer supported the EUA,"" she said in a phone interview, adding that it was irresponsible as a public health official not to relay the information that led the FDA to change its mind. ""Instead he went ahead and emphasized, do whatever you want under off-label prescribing — we’re going to leave this up to you.""
Contrary to Azar’s suggestion that the FDA was making it easier to get chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outpatients, the agency already came forward in late April to caution against the use of both drugs outside of hospitals or a clinical trial.
Misleading Research Summaries 
During the roundtable, Azar and Trump also gave misleading or incomplete descriptions of the evidence to date about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19.
As he has done in the past, the president — who has claimed to have taken hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 — said he has heard ""some great reports"" about the drugs and suggested without evidence that the hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine were going to die anyway. 
Trump, June 15: The only place we don’t get necessarily reports are coming out of Alex’s agency or wherever they come from. I don’t understand that, Alex. What is it exactly? Because I have heard — I’ve had so many people that were so thrilled with the results from hydroxy. So, what is that exactly?
Azar: Well, at your direction, we continue to study, especially in earlier phase — so a lot of the data that has come out that was more negative was people who were quite ill in the hospital.
Trump: People that were, like, seriously ill. Like, they weren’t going to make it. ""Let’s give them a little hydroxy."" And then they don’t make it. And they say, ""Oh, wow, maybe the president was wrong."" All I know is that we’ve had some tremendous reports. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that they think it saved their lives.
As Schluger previously told us, the majority of patients in several hydroxychloroquine studies survived, so it’s not the case that hydroxychloroquine has only been given to deathly ill patients.
It is true, however, that nearly all of the studies have been done in hospitalized patients. 
This includes a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K. called RECOVERY that the FDA cited in its EUA revocation decision. Although the full results have not been published, the trial reported on June 5 that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce the risk of death and also did not shorten the hospital stay or offer beneficial effects on other outcomes.
According to a June 5 press release, 25.7% of the 1,542 hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine died after 28 days, whereas 23.5% of the 3,132 patients who were given usual care died — a difference that was not statistically significant.
The press release concluded that the results ""convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.""
From that data, plus other smaller randomized controlled trials and other rigorously performed observational studies, which we have previously reviewed, it does not appear hydroxychloroquine offers any benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
""The science is pretty straightforward on this,"" said Schluger. ""The data tell a pretty consistent story.""
On June 17, the World Health Organization announced that given the initial findings from its own trial, the results of the RECOVERY trial and a review of the evidence, it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity trial, which also was evaluating the drug in hospitalized patients.
What is less clear — and where Trump and Azar may have a point — is that these results don’t necessarily rule out that hydroxychloroquine might still have some effect in milder cases or for COVID-19 prevention.
Some scientists do think it’s plausible that hydroxychloroquine could still work in these instances — even if there isn’t yet any evidence that it does. 
As Nicholas White, a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health and Mahidol University in Thailand, told us in an email, it’s ""[m]uch easier to prevent infections growing in the body"" than to get ""rid of them once they have grown.""
He is helping to run a multinational randomized controlled trial with upwards of 40,000 participants to test whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine can prevent COVID-19 — and is concerned that some governmental decisions, including the FDA’s memo, might make it harder to complete the trials that are necessary to definitively say whether the drugs work or not.
The WHO, notably, also cautioned that its suspension decision should not apply to trials testing hydroxychloroquine’s ability to prevent COVID-19 either before or after exposure, or what is called pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.
Still, Azar didn’t give the whole story when he said that the ""data is not yet in"" regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat people outside of the hospital or for COVID-19 prevention. While many of these trials are in the works, at least one has reported results — and it, too, failed to identify an effect.
The University of Minnesota published the first post-exposure prophylaxis randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3. In the double-blind trial, more than 800 volunteers were randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within four days of exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly 12% of hydroxychloroquine participants developed a COVID-19-like illness compared with 14.3% of those getting the placebo — a difference that was not significant.
Some scientists argue that more data is needed. They have critiqued the study because it did not confirm COVID-19 infection in the vast majority of people who were exposed and went on to develop the disease — an unavoidable problem, given the lack of testing availability at the time. Others, meanwhile, have found the results largely convincing. 
Schluger called it a ""pretty good study,"" adding, ""it’s a pretty big study — 821 patients — a randomized trial, so that’s a very high standard of evidence.""
Science magazine reported on June 9 that another post-exposure prevention trial, run out of Barcelona, Spain, did not pick up a protective effect of hydroxychloroquine. The trial included more than 2,300 people who were exposed to the coronavirus and found there was no significant difference among those who received hydroxychloroquine versus the standard care in developing COVID-19. The study’s lead investigator told Science that the results had been submitted for publication.
University of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Dr. David Boulware, who led the first published prophylaxis trial, said no studies have reported results yet for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Those studies typically involve high-risk health care workers and have been slower to enroll volunteers.
But he said the results of his university’s trial of hydroxychloroquine in outpatients had been reported to the FDA.
""Investigators from the University of Minnesota conducted a nationwide randomized clinical trial testing hydroxychloroquine for early outpatient treatment of COVID-19,"" he said in an email, adding that the drug was given within four days of the start of COVID-19 symptoms. ""The trial’s final results were shared with FDA on June 11, 2020 as well as with NIH, and the manuscript is presently undergoing scientific peer-review.""
""There are no positive data supporting hydroxychloroquine having a clinical benefit in humans with coronavirus,"" said Boulware in response to Azar’s claim that a lot of the ""more negative"" data was in very ill hospitalized patients. ""The FDA is fully aware of what data do exist for earlier phase treatment.""

		In a March 21 press briefing, President Donald Trump prematurely declared that automakers, including Ford and General Motors, were manufacturing much needed ventilators ""right now.""
It wasn’t until nearly a week after the president’s claim that General Motors and Ventec Life Systems announced that the car company would begin retooling its manufacturing facility in Kokomo, Indiana, to make ""critical care ventilators"" that could be ready to ""ship as soon as next month.""
Prior to that, GM had been working to produce or procure parts for Ventec to increase Ventec’s output of ventilators, and GM was only ""exploring the feasibility to build ventilators"" at one of its own facilities, a company spokesman told us.
The CEO of Ford, meanwhile, has said recently that it could be May or June before Ford, which is partnering with another company that makes the lifesaving machines, begins to produce them in mass.
The collaborations between the car makers and the medical device manufacturers came about as governors and health officials around the country have said that hospitals do not have enough ventilators for patients with COVID-19, which affects the respiratory system and can make it difficult for patients to breathe on their own.
Many politicians have called on Trump to use the full force of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which gives the president the authority to compel private businesses in the U.S. to ramp up the production of necessary supplies during a national emergency. In addition to ventilators, hospitals treating an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are also reportedly lacking essential supplies including respirators and protective gear, such as masks, gloves and gowns.
But Trump has said that he has not needed to rely on the Defense Production Act because several companies have volunteered to help. And he has sometimes given the impression that car companies, in particular, have already started producing ventilators.
In a March 21 press briefing with members of the White House coronavirus task force, for example, Trump said that GM and Ford were making ventilators ""right now.""
Trump, March 21: You know, a ventilator is a machine. It’s a very complex machine. And to think that we have to order hundreds of thousands — nobody has ever heard of a thing like this. … With that being said, General Motors, Ford, so many companies — I had three calls yesterday directly. Without having to institute — like, ""You will do this"" — these companies are making them right now. But to think of these numbers, it’s pretty — it’s pretty mindboggling.
The following day, on Twitter, the president wrote: ""Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?""
Trump’s tweet may have been a reference to the Food and Drug Administration recently deciding to temporarily relax some of the rules that companies have to follow when producing ventilators and other medical supplies. The FDA said the guidance was intended to ""provide a policy to help expand the availability of ventilators as well as other respiratory devices and their accessories during this pandemic.""
But Ford and GM have not started making ventilators yet, and just how ""fast"" they may be able to do so in the future remains to be seen.
General Motors
On March 20, GM announced that it would be helping Ventec Life Systems increase production of Ventec’s ventilators. ""Ventec will leverage GM’s logistics, purchasing and manufacturing expertise to build more of their critically important ventilators,"" the companies said in a joint statement. 
When asked if GM was already producing ventilators, a spokesman, Dan Flores, provided us with another joint statement that said: ""Ventec Life Systems and General Motors have been working around the clock to implement plans to build more critical care ventilators. With GM’s support, Ventec is now planning exponentially higher ventilator production as fast as possible.""
The statement also said: ""As part of those efforts, GM is exploring the feasibility to build ventilators for Ventec at a GM facility in Kokomo, Indiana.""
On March 23, Reuters reported: ""As part of the effort to boost ventilator output from Ventec, GM has arranged for the supply of 95% of the parts needed to build the ventilator and is seeking to source the remaining 37 necessary parts, according to an email to suppliers from Shilpan Amin, GM’s vice president of global purchasing.""
The Reuters story added: ""First parts need to be delivered by suppliers to GM by April 6, the sources said. Supplier production could begin ‘within the next 2-3 weeks,’ Amin said in his email. It was not clear when GM might begin production.""
But on March 27, GM and Ventec announced that GM would, in fact, soon be manufacturing ventilators.
""Ventec Life Systems announced today General Motors will build VOCSN critical care ventilators at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana manufacturing facility with FDA-cleared ventilators scheduled to ship as soon as next month,"" GM said in a statement. ""This effort is in addition to Ventec taking aggressive steps to ramp up production at their manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington.""
The statement continued: ""Efforts to set up tooling and manufacturing capacity at the GM Kokomo facility are already underway to produce Ventec’s critical care ventilator, VOCSN. Depending on the needs of the federal government, Ventec and GM are poised to deliver the first ventilators next month and ramp up to a manufacturing capacity of more than 10,000 critical care ventilators per month with the infrastructure and capability to scale further.""
After that announcement, Trump lashed out at GM on Twitter, saying that ""late April"" isn’t soon enough and that GM must ""START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW.""
Trump also then invoked the Defense Production Act to force GM to make them.
Ford
Ford, on the other hand, announced on March 24 that it would be working with GE Healthcare, which also manufactures ventilators. 
""Ford and GE Healthcare are working together to expand production of a simplified version of GE Healthcare’s existing ventilator design to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by COVID-19,"" Ford said in a statement. ""These ventilators could be produced at a Ford manufacturing site in addition to a GE location.""
In an interview, a Ford spokesman, Mike Levine, told us that the company did not have any information to share about a timeline. He simply said Ford is working on this ""as quickly as possible.""
Levine said ""it’s possible we will take on some of the manufacturing ourselves,"" and added that Ford is in talks with GE Healthcare to see how it would be able to do that.
But Ford’s president and CEO, Jim Hackett, already has said in interviews that it could be more than a month before the company starts producing a product.
For instance, he told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota that it may take until well into May for Ford and other producers worldwide to be making ""hundreds of thousands of ventilators"":
Camerota, March 24: And just — I mean, is there any way to give me a timeline? I mean, doctors say they need them now. Do you know how quickly —
Hackett: Yes, yes — sorry —
Camerota: — you can make them?
Hackett: Yes, there’s no higher sense of urgency. The biggest issue, for example talking to the U.K. last night, is there are six hours of testing at the end of this. You actually have to run the ventilator through a complete cycle to make sure there’s no part of it that fails. It normally takes about 27 hours to make a ventilator. We think we can cut that in half. And I would say to you that the — at scale, by the — by the middle of May, we could be making hundreds of thousands of these ventilators.
Camerota: I’m sorry, hundreds of thousands, how often?
Hackett: I’m saying that by — you have to scale this up, so I’m saying by early May, we could — you could see, across the world, hundreds of thousands of ventilators being built from multiple suppliers, not just Ford Motor Company. 
And in interviews with NPR and CBS’ ""This Morning,"" Hackett said it could take until June for Ford and other companies to scale up production to the rate needed.
Meanwhile, GE Healthcare says it has ""doubled its capacity of ventilator production and has plans to double it again by end of Q2 2020 to address unprecedented demand – independent of the collaboration with Ford.""
Tesla
As for Tesla, which Trump also has mentioned, the electric car and clean energy company’s CEO, Elon Musk, wrote on Twitter recently that he ""had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic,"" a medical device company, ""about state-of-the-art ventilators."" He also tweeted that Tesla ""will make ventilators if there is a shortage"" while noting that the machines ""cannot be produced instantly."" 
He said Tesla’s Giga New York factory in Buffalo ""will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible.""
Musk did not offer more specific information about his company’s plans, and Tesla did not respond to our request for comment.
He did tweet that he already has purchased and shipped more than 1,000 ventilators for use in Los Angeles, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom confirmed in a press conference on March 23.
So, automakers are currently working to help meet the demand for ventilators, whether that means helping other companies that already make the machines, or developing plans to produce ventilators themselves.
But none of those vehicle companies is manufacturing the devices ""right now,"" as the president said. 
Even General Motors has said that its factory has to be retooled before production can begin.

		Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says President Donald Trump has been ""clear"" in calling for the public to ""wear face coverings when you can’t social distance.""
The official messaging from the White House has been, as Azar put it, ""clear and unambiguous"" since early April. But the president’s statements have been anything but.
In the last two weeks, Trump has offered tepid endorsement for masks, saying: ""The mask, perhaps, helps."" He has also raised doubts about the science, noting that health experts who now advocate public mask-wearing were once opposed to it. ""I guess I’m somewhere in the middle,"" Trump said recently. And: ""I understand both sides of the argument.""
""There are a lot of people think that masks are not good,"" Trump said at a town hall on Sept. 15. Adding at a press conference the next day, ""Masks have problems, too.""
He has repeatedly mocked Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s appearance in a mask and for wearing one in circumstances that Trump doesn’t think is necessary. He also accused one reporter of being ""politically correct"" for declining to take off his mask to ask a question.
And, of course, the president has continued to hold densely packed rallies where many supporters are not wearing masks. Trump has said little to discourage them. For example, Trump held an indoor rally in Nevada on Sept. 13 in defiance of the governor’s order limiting the size of gatherings. Press reports noted that few in the densely packed crowd wore masks, though Trump made no mention of the subject.
We reviewed all of Trump’s comments going back to April 3 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for public mask-wearing. Announcing the new guidance that day, Trump repeatedly reminded that the recommendation was voluntary and that he personally would not be wearing a mask. In the following months, his position on masks remained lukewarm — saying he had ""no problem"" with mask-wearing — but refusing to be seen wearing one himself.
His stance evolved some over the summer, as the coronavirus continued to spread around the country. On July 20, he released a photo of himself in a mask. And he repeatedly made unequivocal calls for the public to wear masks, particularly when he appeared to be reading from prepared notes. But his waffling returned late in the summer around the time he began to stage rallies.
Since then, his public comments have been inconsistent, toggling between advocacy and casting doubt, sometimes in the same speech or interview.
Azar’s Spin
In an interview with Azar on Sept. 24, the ""Today"" show’s Savannah Guthrie said Trump’s statements on masks have been ""all over the place,"" and she asked Azar if masks are ""going to make this pandemic less terrible than it is, basically."" (Starting at the 6:40 mark.)
""Masks are important,"" Azar said. ""We have been clear since the, the president has been clear since his April guidance on reopening the economy.""
When Guthrie responded that Trump ""hasn’t been clear,"" Azar referred to the government’s coronavirus.gov website. ""It’s right there, coronavirus.gov, the president’s guidance on reopening: wear face coverings when you can’t social distance. Very clear. He says it, I say it, every health leader says it.""
When Guthrie countered, asking if Trump’s voice wasn’t louder than a government website, Azar again said, ""Well, he says it. I say it. The FDA, CDC, NIH, that’s all we talk about is ‘Wear face coverings when you cannot social distance.’""
The government’s guidance has been ""clear and unambiguous,"" Azar said: ""Wear your face coverings when you can’t be socially distant.""
The official government messaging may be consistent, but as we said, the president’s rhetoric is not. In an interview just two days prior, Trump said the guidance from health experts was originally for the public not to wear masks. After scientists began to learn more about the asymptomatic spread of the virus, that guidance changed. But Trump often brings up this change in position from the scientific community, as he did in an interview on Sept. 22, to express doubts about mask-wearing.
""Everybody was talking about like masks were a bad thing. Then they come like masks are the greatest thing you can do,"" Trump said. ""You know, you get all these different messages. And I guess I’m somewhere in the middle, to be honest with you.""
CDC’s April Guidance
As Trump has often pointed out, members of the scientific community — including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams — were in the early months of 2020 telling the general public not to wear face masks.
However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course on April 3 and recommended that people begin ""wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain."" (Trump on Feb. 7 acknowledged privately in an interview recently made public that he knew the virus is transmitted through the air and it’s much deadlier than the flu.)
In a coronavirus task force briefing in which the new CDC recommendation was announced, Trump repeatedly stressed that the CDC’s recommendation was voluntary, and that he wouldn’t personally be following it.
Trump, April 3: In light of these studies [on asymptomatic spread], the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it. They suggested for a period of time. But this is voluntary. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it …
So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay. It may be good. Probably will. They’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation. It’s voluntary.
Adams, the surgeon general, went into detail at the press conference about why the change to recommending public use of masks was made.
""Well, it’s important to know that we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms,"" Adams said. ""They’re what we call asymptomatic. And that even those who eventually become pre-symptomatic, meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future, can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity: for example, coughing, speaking, or sneezing, even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These include places like grocery stores and pharmacies. We especially recommend this in areas of significant community-based transmission. It is critical.""
The official White House messaging — aside from Trump — has been consistent since then in advocating for the public to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.
‘No Problem’ with Masks
In the ensuing weeks, Trump repeatedly said he had ""no problem with face masks,"" but that he would leave it up to states’ governors to decide whether to mandate their use. He also said he, personally, would ""have no problem wearing a mask,"" if the conditions were appropriate. Trump told reporters he wore a mask briefly while touring Honeywell in early May, though the press did not see it, or photograph it.
On May 11, Trump told reporters that he had begun requiring that White House staffers wear masks. But during the same press conference, Trump said the public had ""learned about facemasks — the good and the bad, by the way. It’s not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.""
On June 20, Trump held an indoor rally in Tulsa. Although there was little social distancing and few in the relatively sparse crowd wore masks, Trump made no appeal to the crowd to wear masks. To the contrary, Trump complained only that the media did not highlight when Black Lives Matter protesters were not wearing masks.
In an interview on July 1 on the Fox Business Network, Trump said he’d ""absolutely"" wear a mask ""if I were in a tight situation with people."" And he said he had worn a mask and liked the way it looked on him. ""It was a dark black mask, and I thought it looked OK,"" Trump said. ""Looked like the Lone Ranger.""
Trump again added that he had ""no problem"" with masks ""and if people feel good about it, they should do it.""
Raising Doubts
In a telephone interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News on July 9, Trump again brought up the reversal by the scientific community on masks, and framed it as an ongoing debate (even though by then there was consensus from his health advisers advocating public mask-wearing).
""They have been wrong about a lot of things, including face masks,"" Trump said. ""Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don’t wear a mask, don’t wear a mask. And now they are saying, wear a mask. So, a lot of mistakes were made, a lot of mistakes.""
Trump added that ""it’s fine to wear a mask, if it makes you feel comfortable"" and that mask-wearing was appropriate in some situations, like when someone visits a hospital.
During the interview, Trump took the opportunity to ridicule Biden for the way he wears his masks, and for wearing one even when he is socially distanced from others. It became a familiar refrain for Trump in interviews and speeches.
Trump, July 9: I watched Biden walk onto a stage with his — practically — like, today, there was almost nobody in the room. He’s making a speech. And they have these massive circles. And the circles are very far away from each other to start off with. And then they have just a few people in the audience. And he makes a speech. And he walks onto the stage wearing this massive mask. There’s nobody on the stage. And then he takes it off. He likes to have it hang off usually the left ear. I think it makes him feel good, frankly, if you want to know the truth. And I guess that’s OK. But when there’s nobody around, you don’t really have to do that. But he feels it’s good. And I’m OK with it, if he wants to do that. He’s got the largest mask I think I have ever seen. It covers up a big proportion of his face. And I think he feels he looks good that way.


Biden has defended his decision to wear masks in those situations, saying it is part of ""setting the example that I’ve tried to set since this began, of being responsible.""
Trump was finally photographed in a mask two days later while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a CBS interview on July 14, Trump said he felt an ""obligation"" to wear a mask in the hospital, because some patients had just come out of operations, and he wanted to be close to them.
Asked if he would tell the American people to wear a mask, Trump hedged.
Trump, July 14: Well, I’d say listen to that instruction, listen to your governors. But I have to say the same people that say wear a mask are people that said, a long time ago, don’t wear a mask, masks are bad. They said they’re not good. So, you know, like Dr. Fauci, surgeon general, a lot of people — a lot of people — the surgeon general said that also.
And right now that [the CDC guideline] is saying wear a mask, and that’s okay with me. That’s good. Those guidelines are good. I’m not stopping them from saying it. I do say this, originally people were saying don’t wear a mask. People that we all respect were saying don’t wear a mask because, look, you know, it’s got certain drawbacks and they say don’t wear a mask. Now they’re saying wear a mask. I’m okay. And it does evolve. You know, I mean, the thought process evolves. So let’s see what happens.
In an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace four days later, Trump offered this mixed message: ""I don’t agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Our surgeon general — terrific guy — said don’t wear a mask. Everybody who is saying don’t wear a mask — all of sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good. But I leave it up to the governors.""
Wearing Masks ‘Patriotic’
Perhaps Trump’s strongest appeal for mask-wearing came via a tweet on July 20, in which he suggested it was patriotic to don one.

We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President! pic.twitter.com/iQOd1whktN
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2020

In a press conference the following day, Trump continued his full-throated advocacy for masks.
Trump, July 21: We’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They’ll have an effect. And we need everything we can get. …
If you’re close to each other, if you’re in a group, I would put it on. …
I view it this way: Anything that potentially can help — and that certainly can potentially help — is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it. I wear it. … I’m getting used to the mask, and the reason is — think about patriotism. Maybe it is. It helps. It helps.
Now, we have experts that have said, in the recent past, that masks aren’t necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they’ve changed their mind. If they change their mind, that’s good enough for me.


In an interview the following day on Fox News, Trump continued to lobby for mask-use.
""I believe that you should wear it, even if there’s a 1% chance it helps,"" Trump said. ""You know, when you look at Dr. Fauci and others — and this isn’t a knock, because this is just the way it — if you look, early on, they were all saying, don’t wear a mask. Don’t wear a mask. That didn’t make total sense to me, but don’t wear a mask. Now they’re all saying, wear a mask. My attitude is, it probably helps. Give it a shot, because we have to win this thing. So, it’s not a question of pride. It’s not a question of anything. We have to win this. So, when you’re in a certain situation, I think you should wear a mask.""
In more than a half dozen coronavirus press briefings from late July through mid-August Trump was consistently unequivocal in calling for the public to ""wear a mask if you cannot socially distance.""
In a TV interview on Aug. 4, Trump said, ""People question masks, but there’s no downside in wearing them.""
In a coronavirus briefing on Aug. 13, Trump tried to draw a distinction between his approach and Biden’s on masks, claiming that Biden wanted a federal mask mandate, while he has left it up to states to decide. (Biden in August said, ""Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing."" He later clarified that ""there’s a constitutional issue whether federal government could issue such a mandate. I don’t think constitutionally they could, so I wouldn’t issue a mandate."")
""My administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks,"" Trump said. ""And I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do. Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good. Maybe they’re not so good. But frankly, what do you have to lose?""
In a campaign speech in Old Forge, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 20, Trump said, ""Do the masks. I mean, it’s just not going to hurt. Do them. Do them. If you feel it, do them.""
Back to Waffling
Trump resumed his in-person rallies in September, and with them began his hedging on masks.
In a campaign speech in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 3, Trump was back to mocking Biden for the way he wears his masks, and when.
""I’ve never seen a man that like the mask more,"" Trump said of Biden. ""Look, I’m all for it … but did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always but a lot of times he has it hanging down because you know what, it gives him a feeling of security. If I were a psychiatrist — right? No, I would say — I would say this guy has got some big issues.""
And Trump’s waffling on using masks returned in an ABC News town hall on Sept. 15.
""But whether it’s Dr. Fauci or anybody else, a lot of people got it wrong,"" Trump said. ""They talked about don’t wear masks, and now they say wear masks. Although some people say don’t wear masks. I mean you have a lot of different ideas.""
""Now there are, by the way, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks,"" Trump said later. ""There are a lot of people think that masks are not good.""
Trump went on to talk about waiters who touch their masks ""and then they’re touching the plate. That can’t be good. … The concept of a mask is good, but it also does … you’re constantly touching it, you’re touching your face, you’re touching plates. There are people that don’t think masks are good.""
In a press briefing the next day, Trump continued to express doubt about the efficacy of wearing masks, and then later said he thought they work.
Trump’s comments came in response to a question about Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC. Redfield testified about masks, saying: ""We have clear scientific evidence they work, and they are our best defense. I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine.""
Trump challenged that comment, saying, ""Number one, it’s not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine.""
""On masks — masks have problems, too,"" Trump said. ""And I talked about the masks about to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that, in restaurants, they have people with masks and they’re playing around with their mask, and they have it — their fingers are in their mask and then they’re serving with plates. I mean, I think there’s a lot of problems with masks.""
""The mask, perhaps, helps,"" Trump said minutes later. ""Don’t forget: A lot of people didn’t like the concept of masks initially. Dr. Fauci didn’t like them, and a lot of people didn’t. And I’m not knocking anybody, because I understand both sides of the argument.""
At a campaign rally in Bedmidji, Minnesota, on Sept. 18, Trump argued that he ought to call his rallies a protest, to get around mask-restrictions.
""You don’t have to wear masks at protests,"" Trump claimed. ""So I said, ‘You know, we can’t have a rally.’ The most we can have is 10 people, but why don’t we just call it a protest because this is a protest. It’s a protest against stupidity. ""
In an interview with a local Fox station in Detroit on Sept. 22, the reporter noted that at some recent Trump rallies, there appeared to be many people ""almost celebrating the fact that they didn’t have to wear a mask.""
Trump said he ""didn’t see that.""
""No I think people should wear a mask if they can, if they feel they can, they should,"" Trump added. ""But I don’t think it should be a mandatory policy.""
""But when you look out into the audience when you’re doing these rallies, and you see the number of people who don’t have masks, does that concern you about the future and this fall?"" the reporter asked.
""I must be honest, I see a lot of people with masks,"" Trump said. ""I also see a little bit of a spreading out. One of the reasons I do the rallies in outside settings is because it’s much better. It’s, you know, recommended. I don’t know if they know what they’re recommending, but they recommend being outside like we’re outside right now.""
In an interview with WGN America at the White House the same day, Trump was again pressed about whether he was concerned about so many maskless people at rallies being exposed to COVID-19.
""No,"" Trump said. ""Because my supporters are very smart and they do, a lot of them wear masks and some don’t, that’s their choice. But they’re, you know, when you’re outside, you have a lot of room, and everything that I’ve read and everything that I’ve seen is outside is better in terms of COVID or as I call it the China virus.""
Trump accused the CDC of sending mixed messages on masks.
""You know, at one point they were saying, don’t wear a mask,"" Trump said. ""Dr. Fauci said, don’t wear a mask — everybody was talking about like masks were bad thing. Then they come like masks are the greatest thing you can do. You know, you get all these different messages. And I guess I’m somewhere in the middle, to be honest with you.""
""There is a mixed message there,"" Trump said. ""But if you remember the original message was don’t wear masks.""
Azar is right that the White House messaging has been ""clear and unambiguous"" — and consistent since early April — that people should wear a mask when they can’t social distance. But as the many comments above reflect, the president has not always been ""clear"" in delivering that message.

		Quick Take
Facebook and Instagram users are sharing a fake tweet attributed to President Donald Trump that suggests the president’s critics won’t get direct government payments to ease the financial burden of the coronavirus pandemic.


Full Story 
As the White House and Congress work on a massive stimulus package to address the novel coronavirus pandemic — which could result in payments to individual taxpayers — social media users are spreading a fabricated tweet attributed to President Donald Trump that suggests such aid could be withheld from his critics.
Trump never posted the tweet in question.
""Yes, I ordered the Treasury Secretary to send checks to Americans!"" the fake post reads. ""First however, we will go through your social media history from the last 4 years and search for any post with #NotMyPresident in it. I wouldn’t think of offending you with a check if I’m not your president! #MAGA.""
A quick search on Trump’s Twitter feed shows no trace of that tweet, which is dated March 17 at 4:13 p.m. We also couldn’t find it in the Trump Twitter Archive, which collects the president’s tweets — including those that have been deleted. The archive shows nearly 50 posts that day on Trump’s account, most of which were re-tweets.

The fictitious tweet may be intended as a joke meant to needle Trump’s critics, but if so, comments show that was not clear to everyone who encountered it.
One post of the doctored screenshot was shared on Instagram by the well-followed radio host Charlamagne Tha God and was liked by more than 61,000 users.
Among the comments on the post, one user said: ""This man’s level of petty is absurd."" Another wrote: ""Does this mean I can stop paying taxes cuz he’s not my president.""
The fake tweet was shared by many on Facebook, too.
It’s worth noting that the payments are part of a package to assist Americans and stabilize the U.S. economy that is still being worked out by the administration and legislators; it is not the president’s decision unilaterally. The $1 trillion proposal drafted by the White House calls for $500 billion for such payments.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on March 19 that payments could amount to $1,000 per adult and $500 per child — meaning a family of four could receive $3,000 — and could be issued in the coming weeks, if the necessary legislation passes.

      Trump’s Flu Shot Reticence

		President Donald Trump cast doubt on the value of influenza vaccines, saying he has never had the seasonal flu and only got a flu shot because he was required to as president. ""I don’t know if I should have. Who knows?""
We don’t know what prompted the president’s reluctance to get a flu shot or why he questioned whether it’s a good idea, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says each year it saves thousands of lives and prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations.
The president’s hesitance about the need for a flu shot comes as medical professionals say those influenza vaccinations will be particularly important this year to lessen public confusion between seasonal flu and COVID-19, and to prevent unnecessary medical evaluations for the new coronavirus.
Trump’s comment about flu shots came during an interview with the Washington Examiner on May 14.
Trump, May 14: I never lost anybody to the flu. Look, I’ve had people having the flu. I said, ""Hey, how are you doing with the flu?"" They had the flu. I never had the flu. You know, the first thing they did, they want to give me a flu shot. I never had the flu. And I come to the White House, ""Sir, we have to give you a flu shot."" I said, ""Why?"" And I took it. I don’t know if I should have. Who knows? Three times now. I’ve taken three flu shots, but anyway. …
It’s not the first time the president has expressed reticence about getting a flu shot. 
""All my life I see — I was lucky; I never had the flu,"" Trump said during a Fox News virtual town hall on May 3. ""Then I came here; they want to give a flu shot. And I said, ‘I don’t want a flu shot,’ but they have to give it.""
The CDC says flu shots carry very little risk and have important benefits. According to the CDC, the vaccine ""can reduce flu illnesses, doctors’ visits, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations."" The CDC points to studies that indicate ""flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine.""
Although Trump said he has never known anyone who has died from the flu, seasonal influenza kills thousands of Americans each year, and infects millions.
For the 2019-2020 flu season, which ended in April, 39 million to 56 million people had flu illnesses in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates from the CDC. The CDC estimates last season’s flu had caused between 24,000 and 62,000 deaths. Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death.
According to the CDC, flu vaccinations — which target the three or four influenza viruses that researchers expect will be most common that season — prevent tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year. About 49% of Americans got a flu shot during the 2018-2019 flu season, and according to the CDC, that prevented: ""4.4 million flu illnesses, more than the population of Los Angeles; 58,000 flu hospitalizations, about the number of students at Ohio State University; 3,500 flu deaths, equivalent to saving about 10 lives per day over the course of a year.""
Risks from getting a flu shot are low, the CDC says. ""Common side effects from a flu shot include soreness, redness, and/or swelling where the shot was given, headache (low grade), fever, nausea, muscle aches, and fatigue,"" according to a CDC webpage about seasonal flu shots.
""Life-threatening allergic reactions to influenza shots are very rare"" the CDC  says. ""There is a small possibility that influenza vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, generally no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe complications from influenza, which can be prevented by influenza vaccine.""
A webpage produced by the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle seeks to debunk ""10 flu shot myths,"" including misconceptions such as that the flu shot can cause the flu, that flu shots don’t work or contain harmful ingredients, and that flu shot side effects are worse than the flu itself. The final entry speaks directly to Trump’s comments.
Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute : Myth #10: I never get the flu so I don’t need to be vaccinated. Just because you’ve been fortunate in the past doesn’t mean you’ll be so this year. As health author Tara Haelle puts it, ""Millions of people have never gotten into car accidents. They still wear seat belts and carry insurance.""
Health experts say flu shots are particularly important this year to ""prevent influenza and possible unnecessary evaluation for COVID-19.""
CDC Director Robert Redfield made this point when he clarified comments he made to the Washington Post on April 21. Redfield told the Post: ""There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. … We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.""


At a press conference the following day, Redfield said he did not mean that the COVID-19 pandemic was going to be worse next winter, but rather that it would be ""more difficult and potentially complicated because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.""
""The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence,"" Redfield said. ""One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront.""

		Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of a Q&A we published Jan. 30. Much has changed since then.
An outbreak of viral pneumonia that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 has sickened more than 200,000 people and led to more than 8,000 deaths worldwide, as of March 18. (See the latest figures here.)
Scientists have made rapid progress in understanding the culprit, a new virus in the coronavirus family, which has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The pneumonia-like disease it causes is called COVID-19.
As the virus has spread, however, misinformation has, too. We’ve written about many bogus claims about the new coronavirus spread through social media, as well as false and misleading claims made by politicians. See our Coronavirus Coverage page for a guide to our articles.  
Here, we answer some key questions about what is known so far about the outbreak and the virus.

When did the outbreak begin, and what is the cause?
Scientists are still working to determine when the virus first emerged in people, but the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. 
After a string of mysterious pneumonia cases, many of them linked to a seafood market selling wild game and live animals, officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.
By Jan. 7, Chinese authorities had isolated a virus, later named SARS-CoV-2, as the cause of the disease, and shared the genome a few days later. This allowed other countries to test for the virus, and for scientists to begin devising treatments and investigating how the outbreak began.
Coronaviruses are a diverse family of large RNA viruses that have characteristic spikes on their surface, making them look like they have a halo, or corona, when viewed under a microscope.
Most coronaviruses that infect humans are relatively benign and cause mild respiratory diseases such as the common cold, said Susan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, in a phone interview. 
But in recent years, new coronaviruses have cropped up that are far more dangerous to humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which led to a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, which was identified in 2012.
According to the WHO, SARS ultimately infected more than 8,000 people, killing 774. Since 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 MERS cases and 858 deaths.
The new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus — and is in the same betacoronavirus subgroup as both the SARS and MERS viruses — but is considered a new pathogen.
What are the symptoms, and how severe is the disease?
The virus causes a pneumonia-like respiratory illness that varies in severity, but can be deadly. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. 
A report in the Lancet that analyzed the first 41 people admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 infection suggests that clinically, the illness is similar to SARS, although fewer patients appear to have diarrhea or upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose and sore throat. 
Some people also report fatigue, and in some cases people have been found to be infected, but clear of any symptoms. 
Many of the symptoms are common to other respiratory diseases. Lab tests based on the virus’ genetic sequence can confirm infection.
It’s not yet known how frequently people die from COVID-19. The reported fatality rates have fluctuated as the disease has spread, hovering around 2-3% in late January, and around 4% as of March 18. For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said in an email.
But these estimates, which are simple calculations of the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases, may not accurately reflect how dangerous the virus is, since the disease course is still underway for many patients, Fisman said. It’s also likely that far more people have been infected, but have not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, he said, the case fatality rate may be significantly lower. (For more on the fatality rate, see our March 5 story ""Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate."")
According to a February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical.
Reports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill and die, deaths are primarily in older folks and those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory conditions and hypertension.
The Chinese CDC study, for instance, found a mortality rate of 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79, while the overall fatality rate then was 2.3% for cases in mainland China.
Similar statistics from Italy bear out this trend. As of March 15, no one in the country below the age of 30 had died from COVID-19, but a fifth or more of those above age 80 with the disease had. In Italy, about 25% of cases have been severe.
How is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the new coronavirus is transmitted from person to person in close contact, within about 6 feet of one another.
Scientists suspect the transmission is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through respiratory droplets when infected people cough or sneeze. This is how scientists believe past coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS have spread.
The incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be around 4 days, but may range from 2 to 14 days, according to the CDC. There is some evidence that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others. A March 16 Science study that modeled how the outbreak unfolded in China also found that people who have few or no symptoms may be responsible for the bulk of the disease spread. The CDC, however, says that people are ""thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic"" and that asymptomatic people are ""not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""
It also could be possible to contract the disease by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or even eyes. A study released in mid-March by scientists with the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton found the virus could be detected for up to 24 hours on cardboard and much longer on hard surfaces including plastic and stainless steel — for up to two to three days.
At a March 18 press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that ""we’re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface,"" adding that the fundamental guidelines are to avoid exposure to ""excess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected … and don’t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it.""
It’s also unclear exactly how infectious the new virus is. Several groups of scientists have attempted to estimate SARS-CoV-2’s basic reproduction number, or R0, which is the average number of other people one person infects, assuming everyone in the population is susceptible.
Using a variety of methods, multiple teams have arrived at figures that generally range from 1.5 to 4, which suggest the transmissibility is roughly in line with that of SARS, but below that of the measles virus, which has an R0 of around 12 to 18, and is one of the most infectious viruses in the world.
""Despite the diversity of approaches taken there’s remarkable consistency in estimates from highly competent investigators, which seem to fall between 2 and 3,"" said Fisman.
An early estimate from the WHO, for example, suggested that every infected person would spread the virus to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average, while a team at Imperial College London pegged the R0 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland calculated an R0 of 1.4 to 3.8, and Harvard researchers Maia Majumder and Kenneth Mandl estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1.
While the figures provide some clue as to how contagious the virus is, it’s important to recognize that these values don’t necessarily say anything about how widespread the outbreak will be. 
As Majumder pointed out on Twitter, the R0 reflects potential transmission, not actual transmission — and that even though seasonal flu has a relatively low R0 of about 1.3, it causes millions of cases per year, whereas SARS had an R0 between 2 and 5, and led to fewer than 10,000 cases.
""Planning, preparedness, and infection control can effectively bring an outbreak of a novel, moderate-R_0 disease to a close even in the absence of vaccines,"" Majumder said in a tweet. ""Because of this, estimates of R_0 for #nCoV2019 should be viewed as a call to action instead of a reason to panic.""
How can people protect themselves from contracting or spreading the virus?
The CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently, with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, avoid touching their faces with unwashed hands, avoid close contact with sick individuals, and avoid social interactions generally to prevent community spread.
The CDC website provides advice on what to do if you’re sick and other resources.
Where have cases been reported?
On March 16, the WHO reported that the total cases and deaths outside China had surpassed those in China.
As of March 18, there have been 214,894 confirmed cases in 156 countries, from Greenland to the Caribbean nation St. Vincent and the Grenadines to the Maldives. The largest number of those cases — 81,102 — occurred in China.
The second-largest total has been in Italy, with 35,713 cases, followed by Iran (17,361), Spain (13,910), Germany (12,327), France (9,052), South Korea (8,413), and the United States (7,769).
As of March 18, 8,732 people had died from COVID-19 worldwide.
Given the speed of the outbreak, these tallies will be out of date soon after we publish this article. Updates are available on a visualization tool put together by Johns Hopkins University.
The CDC also has launched its own state and global maps to show the location of the confirmed cases.
What information do we have about the U.S. cases?
The CDC announced the first American case on Jan. 21 in a man in his 30s who returned home to Washington state after a trip to Wuhan and then fell ill. Many more cases have followed, and the spread of the epidemic has accelerated.
As of March 18, there had been 7,769 cases confirmed in the U.S. But the total number of cases is thought to be quite a bit higher, given the fact that many patients have mild or possibly no symptoms and the U.S. has been slow to implement testing for COVID-19.
Cases of COVID-19 have been reported in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and the territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands. The states with the highest concentration of cases include Washington state, New York state and California.
As of March 18, there had been 118 fatal cases in the United States.
The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31, one day after the WHO did so, and announced a national emergency on March 13. Two days earlier, the WHO had declared the global outbreak a pandemic. 
What are the U.S. travel restrictions?
The White House has issued a series of travel restrictions, beginning when Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the new coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. That policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S. The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau were excluded from the restrictions.
On Feb. 29, Trump expanded those travel restrictions to Iran. On March 11, those restrictions were extended to 26 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Three days later, on March 14, the president added the United Kingdom and Ireland to that list.
Although Trump has referred to the restrictions as a ""travel ban"" and said that he has ""closed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected,"" that’s not accurate. The restrictions exempt, for example, legal permanent residents of the U.S. and their immediate families, although there are travel warnings to many countries that Americans are asked to abide by. And although the president said on March 11 that European travel prohibitions would also pertain to a ""tremendous amount of trade and cargo,"" goods are not affected by the policy.
The U.S. temporarily closed its border with Canada to all non-essential traffic, Trump announced via Twitter on March 18.
For the latest information on travel restrictions by country, see the State Department’s page on COVID-19 Country Specific Information.
To date, there are no travel restrictions on domestic travel. In a press conference on March 16, Trump said, ""We think that hopefully we won’t have to do that. But it’s certainly something that we talk about every day. We haven’t made that decision.""
The CDC has issued a list of things to consider when deciding whether it is safe to travel domestically, such as whether COVID-19 is spreading in the area where you are going and whether your travel would include ""crowded settings, particularly closed-in settings with little air circulation"" including conferences, public events or the use of public transportation.
For the latest travel information, visit the CDC’s COVID-19 Travel page, which includes information on international travel, cruise ship travel, health notices for each country and information for those returning from high-risk countries.
How is the rest of the world responding?
Measures taken by China have slowed the spread of new infections there, and some of the other countries that have been most affected are taking steps to prevent more cases within their own borders and abroad. 
In Italy, which is second to China in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths, a nationwide lockdown went into effect on March 10. Residents can leave their homes for work, for health reasons and for basic needs, such as food shopping. Large gatherings in public spaces are prohibited, and restaurants and bars, which were first ordered to observe a 6 p.m. curfew, have been closed. Sporting events are cancelled, and schools, universities and recreational facilities are closed until at least April 3.
Spain recently announced a ""state of alarm"" and instituted a minimum 15-day lockdown similar to Italy’s, starting March 14. Politico Europe reported that ""citizens can leave their homes only to buy groceries and pharmaceutical products, go to the bank or hospital, or to take care of dependents."" The newspaper added: ""While on the street, they must be unaccompanied at all times, and while they can go to work, most workplaces are to be closed to the public until further notice."" The decree from Spain’s government also reportedly ordered the closing of ""all schools, museums, libraries, hotels and restaurants, and prohibits sporting and cultural activities.""
Prior to that order, Spain had prohibited flights from Italy to Spain until March 25. 
As of March 16, Germany reintroduced border checks at its land borders with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark. Individuals with no valid reason for travel will not be permitted to enter or leave the country — particularly those with symptoms that could indicate they are infected with coronavirus. Also, schools and kindergartens in most German states have been closed until April 20, which is after the Easter holiday.

South Korea reportedly has had success reducing its rate of new infections because of its expansive testing program. As of March 17, South Korea had conducted nearly 287,000 tests for the coronavirus, according to the online publication Our World in Data. That was more than the next two countries, combined.
The South Korean government is also isolating infected individuals, as well as quarantining people with whom they have had contact, and using a tracking system to monitor their whereabouts to ensure they remain in the quarantine area.
Singapore also has been singled-out for its response to the outbreak. As of March 18, the nation of more than 5 million people had 313 confirmed cases of coronavirus and zero deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
In remarks in mid-February, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""Singapore is leaving no stone unturned, testing every case of influenza-like illness and pneumonia.""
The island nation also made the decision early to ""restrict entry for anyone from mainland China and, more recently, from northern Italy, Iran, and South Korea,"" according to a March 6 article in The Lancet.
Reports also indicate that Singapore has made great efforts to track down people who have come in contact with infected people, and has strict rules for individuals in quarantine. Researchers in Singapore also were among the first to develop a test that can detect antibodies that remain in the body after someone has recovered from a coronavirus infection.
What information do we have on testing for COVID-19?
There were numerous problems initially that limited the availability of viral test kits and the number of people being tested in the U.S. We cover those in a March 10 story ""The Facts on Coronavirus Testing.""
On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced that ""any American can be tested with no restrictions, subject to doctor’s order.""
The CDC now recommends that those experiencing COVID-19 symptoms — including fever, cough and shortness of breath — call their doctor if they have been in ""close contact"" with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or are living in ""a community where there is ongoing spread of COVID-19.""
Those at high risk, including the elderly and those with certain chronic medical conditions, should be tested ""even if their illness is mild,"" the CDC says. 
Although testing is now available in all 50 states, the number of U.S. residents who have been tested remains relatively small.
As of March 17, the CDC said that CDC and public health laboratories have tested fewer than 32,000 samples. (The CDC provides daily updates on the number of samples that have been tested.) In addition, commercial labs have tested another 27,000 samples, bringing the total to 59,000, Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant health secretary, said on March 17.
At a March 18 press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Birx said the government is placing a priority on testing in ""regions that were mostly affected. And so you still may have difficulty getting tests in areas that do not have significant cases.""

When will there be a COVID-19 vaccine and an antiviral treatment?
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that a vaccine at best won’t be ready for ""a year to a year-and-a-half"" and won’t be available for the current epidemic.
""We can’t rely on a vaccine over the next several months to a year,"" Fauci said at a Feb. 27 White House press conference. ""However, if this virus, which we have every reason to believe it is quite conceivable that it will happen, will go beyond just a season and come back and recycle next year. If that’s the case, we hope to have a vaccine.""
On March 16, the National Institutes of Health announced that a Phase 1 clinical trial has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The trial will involve 45 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 over a six-week period, NIH said.
But that is just the first phase of a lengthy process to make sure that the vaccine is effective and safe to use, as Fauci explained at a Feb. 25 press conference.
""[Y]ou need at least three to four months to determine if it’s safe and whether it induces the kind of response that you would predict will be protective,"" Fauci said of the Phase 1 trial. ""Once you do that you graduate to a much larger trial.""
A Phase 2 trial would involve ""hundreds if not thousands of individuals to determine efficacy,"" Fauci said. ""That itself, even at rocket speed, would take at least an additional six to eight months. So when you are talking about the availability of a vaccine even to scale it up you’re talking about a year to a year-and-a-half.
As for an antiviral treatment, one could be ready by June at the earliest, officials say.
NIH announced on Feb. 25 that it had begun a ""randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"" at the University of Nebraska.
""Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment,"" NIH said in a press release. ""It was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses.""
Daniel O’Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, said at a March 2 White House meeting that the company hopes to know by April if the drug works. Fauci said ""if the trial that Daniel is talking about proves efficacy, which you likely might know in a few months whether it’s … effective or not. If you know by June that it’s effective, then you just scale up and manufacture it, and you’re good to go.""

      Baseless Conspiracy Theory Follows Deaths of Haitian President, Other National Leaders

		SciCheck Digest
Following the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, social media posts baselessly suggest that he and other world leaders were killed or died because they opposed COVID-19 vaccination in their countries. All the leaders named in the posts, except Moïse, died of natural causes. At least one supported vaccination.

              Could a COVID-19 vaccine become mandatory?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              States and certain workplaces can require individuals to be vaccinated.
As legal and public health expert Joanne Rosen of Johns Hopkins University has explained, the legal precedent for states to make vaccinations compulsory goes back to a 1905 Supreme Court case involving the smallpox vaccine. The court sided with the state, finding that the vaccination requirement was a reasonable regulation to protect public health.
Employers are also allowed to require their workers to get a vaccine, if vaccination is reasonably related to a person’s job, such as in the health care industry. In guidance issued in December 2020, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission implied that all employers can have a mandatory vaccination policy, including for COVID-19, as long as employers comply with federal laws stipulating that reasonable accommodations should be made for workers who cannot be immunized because of a disability or religious reason. The matter is likely to be tested in court, as we’ve explained, because the COVID-19 vaccines have yet to be fully licensed.
The federal government cannot issue a vaccine mandate, Rosen told us, but could provide financial incentives for states to do so.
""[T]he Supreme Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment to prevent the federal government from commandeering or requiring state officers to carry out federal directives,"" the Congressional Research Service explained in a 2019 report. ""In the context of vaccination, this principle prevents Congress from requiring states or localities to pass mandatory vaccination laws, but it does not impede Congress from using its Spending Clause authority to provide incentives (in the form of federal grants) to states to enact laws concerning vaccination.""

              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
The president of Haiti, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated on July 7 at his home in Port-au-Prince and first lady Martine Moïse was severely injured during the attack.  
According to news reports, a group of mercenaries from Colombia and at least two Haitian Americans have been detained in connection with the attack.
Several nations are involved in the investigation — including the U.S., which sent officials from the FBI, Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to Haiti on July 12. 
Following Moïse’s death, posts shared widely on social media have advanced the baseless conspiracy theory that he was among several national leaders who were killed — or died under ""suspicious circumstances"" — over the past 13 months because they opposed COVID-19 vaccinations in their countries. 




""What do all these world leaders have in common? They all opposed vaccination of the citizens of their countries. What else? They all were recently assinated or died of very suspicious circumstances,"" reads an Instagram post listing the names of the five deceased leaders. 
Another Instagram post shows photos of the five leaders and reads: ""MURDERED? FOR OPPOSING COVID-19 VACCINES?""
But the claims are false or unfounded on several points.
While the investigation is underway, no evidence has been surfaced suggesting that Moïse was assassinated because of opposition to the COVID-19 vaccination. 
Amid a surge in COVID-19 cases in Haiti, Moïse imposed a nightly curfew and mask mandate in May. But Haiti has been slow in initiating a vaccine program and refused an initial shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines, citing concerns over adverse side effects.
The Instagram posts get the facts wrong on the deaths of the other leaders.
The president of Tanzania, John Magufuli, died on March 17 of a heart condition, chronic atrial fibrillation, according to the East African country’s former vice president, Samia Suluhu Hassan. Hassan said on national television that Magufuli ""had this heart condition for the past 10 years,"" and the Guardian reported he wore a pacemaker. 
It is true that Magufuli was a COVID-19 skeptic. He suggested people ""pray and inhale herb-infused steam"" to fight COVID-19 instead of taking the vaccine. 
Before Magufuli’s death, Tanzania hadn’t published any statistics regarding COVID-19 since May 2020, despite requests from the World Health Organization. Three months after Magufuli’s death, Tanzania began working to join the COVAX global vaccine-sharing program. 
Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza died on June 8, 2020. He had been admitted to a hospital two days earlier. His condition improved, but he suffered cardiac arrest and efforts to revive him were unsuccessful, according to government officials.
Nkurunziza faced criticism for not taking serious measures to protect citizens from COVID-19. The former soccer player had not imposed pandemic restrictions in the country and allowed large sports events and political demonstrations to continue. 
Although Magufuli and Nkurunziza opposed COVID-19 vaccinations in their countries, they apparently died from heart conditions, not murder, as the posts suggest without evidence.

Hamed Bakayoko became prime minister of Ivory Coast, also known as Côte d’Ivoire, in July 2020. Bakayoko died of cancer at a hospital in Germany on March 10. 
Bakayoko never denied the existence of COVID-19, having contracted the virus himself in recent months. He sought vaccines for his country, and on Feb. 26, Ivory Coast received 504,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from COVAX, making it one of the first nations to receive vaccines through that program.
Ambrose Dlamini, the prime minister of the kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, died on Dec. 13, 2020, four weeks after testing positive for COVID-19. We could find no evidence of Dlamini supporting or opposing vaccines.
In a statement posted July 8, 2020, on the government’s website, Dlamini said his country had declared a national emergency in response to the pandemic and subsequently passed regulations to battle COVID-19. 
A partial lockdown was declared in Eswatini to restrict the movement of people and ensure maximum compliance with health protocols based on WHO and International Labour Organization recommendations. 
Authorities in Eswatini announced plans to vaccinate the entire population against COVID-19 using programs such as COVAX shortly after Dlamini’s death from the virus.

		In a tweet, Sen. Rand Paul misleadingly suggested that immunity from ""[n]aturally acquired"" COVID-19 was better than that from a vaccine. But it’s not known how immunity from the two sources compares — and the entire point of a vaccine is to offer immunity without the risk of getting sick.
Paul made his claim in a Nov. 17 tweet in which he listed interim efficacy figures from two ongoing vaccine clinical trials and then provided his own calculation of the ""effectiveness"" of natural infection with the coronavirus.


In a follow-up tweet, the Kentucky Republican shared a link to a New York Times article about a new unpublished study that found evidence of some immunity to the coronavirus in most people for at least six months. He commented: ""Why does the left accept immune theory when it comes to vaccines, but not when discussing naturally acquired immunity?""
Paul, who has previously spread misinformation about childhood vaccines, has inaccurately argued during the COVID-19 pandemic that parts of the U.S. have reached herd, or community, immunity because of preexisting immunity to other coronaviruses. Herd immunity is when enough people in a population are immune to prevent spread of the disease.


Public health experts, however, have said that threshold is still a ways off — and that allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled would lead to many needless deaths. A better approach, they say, is to stave off the spread of the virus until a vaccine is widely available.
A Paul spokesperson told us that the senator was not suggesting that immunity through natural infection with COVID-19 is better than getting immunity from a vaccine, but rather, ""highlighting research that says immunity is real.""
We were directed to subsequent tweets, including one in which Paul said he was not ""arguing against vaccines"" but that COVID-19 patients ""can celebrate immunity if lucky enough to survive,"" as well as Paul’s support for alternative options to speed along access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Still, the efficacy figure Paul provides for natural COVID-19 infection isn’t accurate. And the juxtaposition of the numbers implies a kind of superiority of natural infection over vaccination — a dangerous notion, given that contracting the virus poses a serious risk.
As University of Florida biostatistician Natalie Dean pointed out in response to Paul’s tweet, ""The key distinction is that vaccines are a SAFE way to achieve immunity. Getting sick with COVID-19 is inherently unsafe. We would never ever tolerate a vaccine that carried even a fraction of the risks of natural infection.""
Bogus ‘Efficacy’ Figure
While Paul purports to offer a precise percentage for how ""effective"" natural infection is relative to vaccines, experts told us that the comparison is premature and faulty. 
The efficacy figures for the vaccines come from interim results released in press releases by the two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, and refer to the ability of the vaccines to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 infection in phase 3 trials. (The day after Paul’s tweet, Pfizer announced additional data reflective of the full trial, which showed 95% efficacy.) But the number for natural infection is a broad-strokes calculation Paul made based on reinfections.
""We don’t really know how many reinfections there have been,"" virologist Angela Rasmussen said in a phone interview, adding that many reinfections have not been confirmed and that efficacy of naturally-acquired immunity ""isn’t a thing.""
""It’s just really ridiculous to try to use the way that efficacy is calculated in clinical trials for vaccines and apply that to epi[demiologic] data across the entire population,"" she said.
Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, agreed.
""Clearly, there are people who can be reinfected. As a general rule, it’s usually more mild reinfection,"" he told us. But, he added, ""most people aren’t tested, so you don’t really know who’s getting reinfected and who isn’t.""
It’s true that reinfections so far appear to be rare, which bodes well both for a vaccine and for people who may have immunity as a result of infection. But no one knows yet how the immunity from each will compare.
Most vaccines do not offer quite as good protection from a pathogen as a natural infection will — but of course, a person has to survive or suffer through the infection to get that future protection, sidestepping the entire function of a vaccine. It’s therefore largely irrelevant whether or not vaccine immunity is superior to that from natural infection.
There are some instances in which a vaccine does elicit a better immune response. That’s the case for vaccines against human papillomavirus, or HPV; tetanus; Haemophilus influenzae type b; and pneumococcus.
Whether COVID-19 will be one of them remains to be seen. Rasmussen said it was possible, but still hypothetical at this point. ""We don’t really know. We only know that these vaccines typically induce levels of neutralizing antibody that are comparable to the higher levels of neutralizing antibody that’s been observed in convalescent patients,"" she said, referring to the type of antibody that can prevent cells from becoming infected with the virus.
Based on the performance of the shingles vaccine, Offit speculated that some of the later-arriving vaccine candidates that include powerful adjuvants, or chemicals that are added to vaccines to boost the immune response, such as those from Sanofi-GSK or Novavax, might be better than natural infection.
Immunity Unknowns
For both the vaccine and natural infection, important questions about COVID-19 immunity remain.
""We do know that most people who get COVID-19 do develop some kind of measurable antibody response, but we don’t know what that really means in terms of protection against either reinfection or whether you will mount protective immune responses upon a re-exposure,"" said Rasmussen.
As a result, public health officials have cautioned that for now, even if people have previously contracted COVID-19, individuals should still follow the standard recommendations. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, advises all people, including those who have recovered from COVID-19, to continue to physically distance, wear masks, wash their hands and avoid crowds.
Similarly, the CDC notes that it doesn’t yet know ""if or when"" it will stop recommending masks or physical distancing after vaccination.
This is in contrast to Paul’s assertion that people ""can celebrate immunity."" In a Nov. 12 interview on Fox News, Paul used similar language and advocated that people drop these precautions. 
""We have 11 million people in our country who’ve already had COVID. We should tell them to celebrate,"" he said. ""We should tell them to throw away their masks, go to restaurants, live again, because these people are now immune.""
A huge question is how durable immunity will be. Although the study Paul highlighted suggests that most people will be protected for at least six months — and might mean they are protected against severe disease for many years — it’s still not definitive, and doesn’t mean that those timeframes will apply to everyone.
Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and one of the senior authors of the paper, noted on Twitter that the team observed a wide range of immune responses in people, including a lack of a measurable response in some people. 
""That led us to speculate,"" he said, quoting his manuscript, that ""‘it may be expected that at least a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2-infected population with particularly low immune memory would be susceptible to re-infection relatively quickly.’""
The CDC, notably, has said that people who have had COVID-19 may still benefit from a coronavirus vaccine. And some experts envision a future in which multiple vaccines are on the table for everyone. 
""It strikes me as not unlikely that we will learn what the duration of protection is and people will need — whether naturally infected or vaccinated — to have booster shots over some period of time, once a year, once every two years, once every five years,"" Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a press call.
Why Naturally-Acquired Herd Immunity Is a Bad Idea
In his tweet about the new immunity study, Paul also suggested that Democrats were somehow denying realities about immunity from natural infection.
""Why does the left accept immune theory when it comes to vaccines, but not when discussing naturally acquired immunity?"" he asked.
Scientists, however, objected to Paul’s characterization.
""I don’t think anybody’s dismissing [immunity following natural infection]. I think what people are saying is, it’s a bad idea as a strategy for dealing with infection,"" said Offit, who noted that 30% to 40% of the population could be considered at high risk for COVID-19.
Both Offit and Rasmussen also pointed out that historically, there isn’t a lot of precedent for building herd immunity through natural infection.
""People were getting smallpox for millennia,"" Rasmussen said, and ""the herd immunity threshold was never really reached.""
The much safer way of getting to herd immunity is to use a vaccine instead, especially when multiple candidates are on the horizon.
""Trying to achieve herd immunity [without a vaccine] would result in hundreds of thousands more — if not millions — of unnecessary deaths and debilitating illness for millions more,"" Rasmussen said. ""So I think it’s not really right to talk about vaccine-induced herd immunity versus naturally-acquired herd immunity without mentioning the fact that one of them has a very, very large price tag in human lives and quality of life attached to it.""

      Trump Falsely Claims He Inherited ‘Empty’ Stockpile

		More than once, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies he inherited from his predecessor was an ""empty shelf.""
While the government does not publicize all of the contents of the repository, at the time Trump took office, the Strategic National Stockpile, as it is formally known, reportedly contained vast amounts of materials that state and local health officials could use during an emergency, including vaccines, antiviral drugs, ventilators and protective gear for doctors and nurses.
""The SNS was definitely not an empty shell,"" Dr. Tara O’Toole, a former homeland security official during the Obama administration who is now executive vice president at the nonprofit strategic investment firm In-Q-Tel, told us in an email.
At least three times in the past week, however, Trump has sought to blame former President Barack Obama’s administration for the current state of the stockpile, which has been unable to meet the demand for additional supplies expected to be needed to treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or to protect the doctors and nurses caring for those patients. 
During a White House coronavirus task force briefing on March 26, in which Trump mentioned the number of respirators, face shields and ventilators that had so far been distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the president said: ""We took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place, in a lot of ways.""
When a reporter asked him about that claim during another briefing the following day, Trump again said he inherited ""an empty shelf"" that he had to refill. 
And he continued to use that inaccurate description on March 30, during an interview with the hosts of ""Fox & Friends."" ""We started off with an empty shelf,"" he said, adding, ""We didn’t have very much in terms of medical product … and we built something really good.""
Strategic National Stockpile
The Strategic National Stockpile was created in 1999, and, as of April 2, was described on a Department of Health and Human Services website as ""the nation’s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.""
(That description was later altered to say, ""The Strategic National Stockpile’s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies."" The change was made after Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, said on April 2: ""The notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile. It’s not supposed to be states’ stockpiles that they then use."" Some interpreted Kushner’s remarks to mean the federal stockpile was not meant to be used by states, which would be false. But, in context, Kushner said the federal government is trying to ""make informed data-driven decisions, both on ventilators, masks, any other supply we can get, to make sure it’s going to the people who need them."")
Most of the materials in the stockpile are stored in large warehouses around the country, and where those warehouses are located, and exactly what’s in them, is not publicly disclosed.
But NPR science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce was allowed to visit one facility in June 2016 — only months before Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. In her article about the warehouse she toured, she described the shelves as being the opposite of bare.
""A big American flag hangs from the ceiling, and shelves packed with stuff stand so tall that looking up makes me dizzy,"" Greenfieldboyce wrote.
She continued:
Greenfieldboyce, for NPR, June 26, 2016: The Strategic National Stockpile got its start back in 1999, with a budget of about $50 million. Since then, even though the details aren’t public, it’s clear that it has amassed an incredible array of countermeasures against possible security threats.
The inventory includes millions of doses of vaccines against bioterrorism agents like smallpox, antivirals in case of a deadly flu pandemic, medicines used to treat radiation sickness and burns, chemical agent antidotes, wound care supplies, IV fluids and antibiotics.
I notice that one section of the warehouse is caged off and locked. Shirley Mabry, the logistics chief for the stockpile, says that’s for medicines like painkillers that could be addictive, ""so that there’s no pilferage of those items.""
As we walk, I hear a loud hum. It’s a giant freezer packed with products that have to be kept cold.
Just outside it, there are rows upon rows of ventilators that could keep sick or injured people breathing. Mabry explains that they’re kept in a constant state of readiness. ""If you look down to the side you’ll see there’s electrical outlets so they can be charged once a month,"" she says. Not only that—the ventilators get sent out for yearly maintenance.
In fact, everything here has to be inventoried once a year, and expiration dates have to be checked. Just tending to this vast stash costs a bundle — the stockpile program’s budget is more than half a billion dollars a year.
And that was the scene at just one of the repositories where the medicine and supplies are housed. As of 2016, there were at least six warehouses holding ""approximately $7 billion in products across more than 900 separate line items,"" according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
VICE News reported on March 17 that its film crew was also allowed inside one of the facilities for an episode of ""VICE News Tonight"" that aired in December 2016.  
""[A]lthough we couldn’t reveal where it was or what exactly it had inside. It looked like a prepper’s Ikea, with row after row of containers filled with mystery medications and equipment — including that one item everyone’s been talking about lately, ventilators,"" Vice News said.
In her story, Greenfieldboyce also quoted an official with a consulting firm the government had recently hired to analyze how well the stockpile could respond to a range of threats.
Rocco Casagrande, the managing director of Gryphon Scientific, told her that he couldn’t publicly discuss the results of the analysis. But, she wrote, he did say ""that across the variety of threats that we examined, the Strategic National Stockpile has the adequate amount of materials in it and by and large the right type of thing.""
That doesn’t sound to us like empty shelves, either.
O’Toole, who also chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, did tell us in an interview that ""the SNS mission has expanded"" over the years and ""one could argue resources did not expand commensurately.""
But the idea that the stockpile should be able to provide all of the supplies needed during a pandemic is misguided, she said.
""It was never, never, never intended to be the full answer to any disaster,"" she explained. ""It was intended to bridge from the moment of crisis until a little while after when the private sector would be able to gear up and use the whole global supply chain to deliver what was needed.""
Some Supplies Not Fully Restocked
It’s true that some of the supplies in the stockpile that governors are currently asking the government to send to states were not completely restocked during Obama’s presidency.
For example, the Washington Post reported on March 10 that the reserves of the N95 respirator masks were not ""significantly restored"" after tens of millions of the devices were distributed from the stockpile during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. Medical personnel wear the respirators because they can ""filter out at least 95% of airborne particles,"" according to the Food and Drug Administration.
Greg Burel, who was the director of the Strategic National Stockpile for more than 12 years until he retired in January, recently told CBS News: ""We didn’t receive funds to replace those masks, protective gear and the anti-virals that we used for H1N1."" 
He told Vice News that he decided to use the program’s limited funding to instead purchase vaccines, flu medications and other pharmaceuticals.
""We had to trade off those funds that we had, and we chose to invest in those lifesaving drugs that would not be available from any other source, in the quantity needed, and in time. I definitely want to see my healthcare workers protected; that’s very important. But if I’m thinking, ‘Do I buy this many masks to protect this many workers, or do I buy this many medicines to keep people safe that we can’t get elsewhere?’ there’s no easy answer here,"" Burel said.
In other cases, the Obama administration’s attempts to add more equipment, such as ventilators, to the stockpile were not successful.
As the New York Times reported earlier this week:
New York Times, March 29: Thirteen years ago, a group of U.S. public health officials came up with a plan to address what they regarded as one of the medical system’s crucial vulnerabilities: a shortage of ventilators.
The breathing-assistance machines tended to be bulky, expensive and limited in number. The plan was to build a large fleet of inexpensive portable devices to deploy in a flu pandemic or another crisis.
Money was budgeted. A federal contract was signed. Work got underway.
And then things suddenly veered off course. A multibillion-dollar maker of medical devices bought the small California company that had been hired to design the new machines. The project ultimately produced zero ventilators.
That failure delayed the development of an affordable ventilator by at least half a decade, depriving hospitals, states and the federal government of the ability to stock up. The federal government started over with another company in 2014, whose ventilator was approved only last year and whose products have not yet been delivered.
On CNN’s ""State of the Union"" on March 15, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that there were 12,700 ventilators in the stockpile. At the time, there were 3,487 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As of April 2, there were 239,279 reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. In a task force press briefing that same day, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk said that the U.S. has delivered more than 7,600 ventilators to the states, and still has some in reserve.
Still, O’Toole said she wishes there was less of a focus on expanding the stockpile because it will never be enough and will always lack something that is needed.
""You can’t stockpile your way out of a pandemic like this,"" she emphasized.
One of the reasons for the current supply shortage, she said: ""We’ve allowed our own national capacity to manufacture things to degrade and in some places go away. And we’ve done that for cost-efficiency sake.""
She later added: ""What we need is not a big stockpile. We need a new strategy. We need to use the technologies we have now to create the capacity to respond to something in close to real-time.""
That means being able to ""rapidly design and manufacture what we need, when we need it, and the quantities demanded,"" she said.

		Quick Take
April Fool’s Day brought a spate of false posts claiming students will have to repeat the school year. While many schools across the U.S. closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, there’s no indication they’ll call for repeating the school year.

Full Story
The combined forces of the COVID-19 pandemic and the internet have made this April Fool’s Day a treacherous one. Jokes that may have once been good for a laugh among friends now have the potential to mislead social media users at a time when dangerous misinformation on health and public policy is proliferating.
One prank-generating website has been used to make dozens of false headlines, including many versions of a claim that students will have to repeat the school year:

""All Virginia students will repeat current grade next year""
""California: Students will repeat their grade for the 2021 school year""
""Governor announces all children in TN will repeat same grade next year""
""All Pennsylvania kids to repeat their current grade next year""
""NJ to repeat current grade next year""
""All Illinois Students to Repeat Current Grade Next Year""

All of these posts, which were shared on Facebook, link back to the prank-generating website that shows this message: ""April Fools!"" But if users don’t click through, all they see is what looks like a regular news headline paired with a picture of a public official. In the case of the headlines above, most featured a picture of the governor of the state that was named.
While many schools have closed in an effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, we haven’t found any indication that students will have to repeat a grade. All of the states mentioned above — Virginia, California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Illinois — have closed schools. Some have suspended testing requirements. But none have recommended repeating the school year.
The same prank site has created a spate of other bogus headlines, including some that fuel rumors we’ve already debunked.
So, be wary of alarming headlines shared on social media. Like the fake posts about the school year, they may not be true.

		In a little more than a month, President Donald Trump’s language about the coronavirus has shifted, from talk of 15 cases that ""within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero"" to warning of as many as 2.2 million deaths in the country if no social distancing efforts were undertaken. 
At times, the president has acknowledged he changed his assessment of the pandemic, but in other cases, he and Vice President Mike Pence have tried to revise history, ignoring or recasting his previous statements.
Here, we outline Trump’s evolving language on the deadliness of the virus, its spread in the U.S. and how it compares with the seasonal flu. We also provide a timeline of the president’s comments below.
The Threat of the Coronavirus
In an interview on CNN on April 1, Pence said, ""I don’t believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus.""
That may be what the vice president believes. But he is wrong. The truth is that Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus.
From Jan. 22 to March 10, as we reported before, Trump made a series of statements minimizing the danger posed to the United States. (See our timeline below.)
On March 16, Trump reversed course, imposing social distancing guidelines for 15 days. The following day, he said at a press conference: ""This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."" 
But he soon sounded a different tone again.
As recently as March 24 at a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump likened the disease’s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents. At the time the president was considering, for economic reasons, whether to relax the social distancing guidelines he had imposed to combat the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Trump, March 24: I brought some numbers here, we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, ""Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore."" We have to get back to work.
He suggested he might ease the social distancing guidelines. ""I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" he said.
On March 29, the president abandoned that aspiration and announced the guidelines would remain in place until April 30.
In the CNN interview, Pence maintained that the president had been aware throughout of the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak. Confronted by anchor Wolf Blitzer with statements by Trump minimizing the danger, Pence replied, ""The president is an optimistic person. We’ve been from the very beginning, when the president suspended all travel from China and stood up the White House coronavirus task force in January, we have been hoping for the best but planning for the worst, and that’s been being worked out every single day.""
(The vice president is wrong to claim that ""the president suspended all travel from China"" from ""the very beginning."" As we have written, the administration did not suspend ""all travel."" There were exceptions, including for Americans and their family members, to the travel policy announced on Jan. 31.)
‘Under Control’
In a coronavirus task force press briefing on March 15, Trump praised the task force members standing behind him, saying they have been ""working around the clock"" and were ""doing an incredible job."" Then, he added, ""This is a very contagious — this is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.""
The next day, when asked about that statement, Trump attempted to reframe his past comments about the U.S. having the coronavirus ""under control.""
""Well, when I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with,"" Trump said. ""If you’re talking about the virus, no, that’s not under control for any place in the world.""
At times, Trump has been clear that he meant the federal government’s response to the pandemic is ""under control,"" such as on Feb. 29 when talking about a ""natural reflex"" among Democrats to criticize his actions.
""And we’ve done a great job,"" Trump said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. ""And I’ve gotten to know these professionals. They’re incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they’re very, very cool. They’ve done it, and they’ve done it well. Everything is really under control. But when they put a mic in front of a Democrat, and the Democrat said — doesn’t even know what’s going on. ‘How is Trump doing?’ ‘He’s doing a terrible job.’ Well, sadly, I’d probably say the same about them.""
At other times, however, Trump’s ""under control"" comments appear to be about the coronavirus itself. For example, on Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.""
Or on Feb. 26, when Trump said, ""It’s going to be very well under control. Now, it may get bigger, it may get a little bigger. It may not get bigger at all. We’ll see what happens. But regardless of what happens, we are totally prepared.""
Or on Feb. 25 when he said at a business roundtable in India, ""If you go back six months or three months ago, nobody would have ever predicted. But let’s see, I think it’s going to be under control. And I think I can speak for our country, for — our country is under control.""
That same day during a press conference in India, Trump said: ""You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it.""
Moving the Goal Posts on the Outbreak
The Trump administration has moved the goal posts dramatically when it comes to estimates of how many Americans will contract COVID-19.
For weeks, as he downplayed the disease’s danger, Trump said there were just a small number of cases in the U.S. and that the disease would vanish. By the end of March, he was saying that without dramatic action like social distancing, as many as 2.2 million Americans could die.
On Feb. 10, when he suggested the disease would go away ""in April with the heat — as the heat comes in,"" Trump said, ""We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now."" (See our item ""Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?"")
On Feb. 26, the president said, ""As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time.""  That same day, he also said, ""And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.""
Trump was still downplaying the scope of the problem on March 4, when he said, ""[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country.""
But by the end of the month, Trump was painting a stark picture of the disease’s potential toll. On March 29, when he announced he was extending social distancing guidelines until the end of April, he said as many as 2.2 million Americans could die of COVID-19 if the country failed to take decisive action.
He said, ""So you’re talking about 2.2. million deaths — 2.2 million people from this. And so, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job. But 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that.""
At a White House briefing on March 31, federal health officials raised the upper limit of those who might die from the disease even with mitigation efforts to 240,000.
Trump’s Flu Comparisons
Several times, Trump had compared the coronavirus outbreak to the seasonal flu, but in the March 29 task force briefing, Trump acknowledged that he had changed his mind about this.
""But there were a lot of people that said — I thought about it. I said, ‘Maybe we should ride it through.’ You know, you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We’re in the midst of a bad flu season, Trump said. ""But this is different. And part of this is the unknown, and part of it also is the viciousness of it.""
Two days later, he repeated those remarks, but said the flu comparison came from ""many friends"" and ""a lot of people.""
""I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually, common sense, they said, ‘Why don’t we ride it out?’ A lot of people have said, a lot of people have thought about it, ‘Ride it out, don’t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu.’ But it’s not the flu,"" Trump said.
That’s a marked difference from his earlier comments comparing COVID-19 to the flu. For example, in the March 24 virtual town hall, Trump said, ""And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off.""
And in a March 9 tweet, he said deaths from the flu average ""between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!""
In a Feb. 26 press conference, Trump made some confusing remarks that wrongly suggested the fatality rate for the flu is ""much higher"" than the rate for COVID-19, as we wrote. So far, the worldwide fatality rate for COVID-19 has been higher, but, as we have explained, the rate may end up falling as more is known about the actual number of cases. 
As for the seasonal flu, or influenza, it does kill thousands of Americans each year, and infects millions. For the 2019-2020 flu season, 39 million to 55 million people had flu illnesses in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC estimates this season’s flu had caused between 24,000 and 63,000 deaths. Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death.
Trump also has made comparisons between the coronavirus pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, but as we’ve written, the two viruses are very different. Peter Jay Hotez, a professor and dean of the tropical medicine school at Baylor College of Medicine, told us that the novel coronavirus, which is known as SARS-CoV-2, is considerably more transmissible and more lethal than the H1N1 influenza virus. ""The urgency to contain this coronavirus is so much greater than the H1N1 2009 one was,"" he said.
Timeline of Trump’s Comments
Here is a timeline of statements the president has made about the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, beginning two days after the first case in the country was confirmed:
Jan. 22: ""We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. And we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine."" — CNBC interview
Jan. 30: ""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you."" — a speech in Michigan
Feb. 10: ""Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now."" — remarks to governors
Feb. 14: ""There’s a theory that, in April, when it gets warm — historically, that has been able to kill the virus. So we don’t know yet; we’re not sure yet. But that’s around the corner."" — speaking to National Border Patrol Council members
Feb. 23: ""We have it very much under control in this country."" — speaking to reporters
Feb. 24: ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!"" — on Twitter

Feb. 25: ""If you go back six months or three months ago, nobody would have ever predicted. But let’s see, I think it’s going to be under control. And I think I can speak for our country, for — our country is under control."" — abusiness roundtablein New Delhi, India
Feb. 26: ""So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck."" — White House task force briefing
Feb. 26: ""And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done."" — press conference
Feb. 26: ""I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up."" — press conference, when asked if ""U.S. schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading""
Feb. 26: ""It’s going to be very well under control. Now, it may get bigger, it may get a little bigger. It may not get bigger at all. We’ll see what happens. But regardless of what happens, we are totally prepared."" — press conference
Feb. 27: ""It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear. And from our shores, we — you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We’ll see what happens. Nobody really knows."""" — White House meeting with African American leaders
Feb. 29: ""And I’ve gotten to know these professionals. They’re incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they’re very, very cool. They’ve done it, and they’ve done it well. Everything is really under control."" — speech at CPAC, outside of Washington, D.C.
March 4: ""[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40-plus people [from a cruise ship]. … We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers. But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States."" —White House meeting with airline CEOs
March 4: ""Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number."" — interview on Fox News, referring to the percentage of diagnosed COVID-19 patients worldwide who had died, as reported by the World Health Organization. (See our item ""Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate."")
March 7: ""No, I’m not concerned at all. No, I’m not. No, we’ve done a great job."" — speaking to reporters, when asked if he was concerned about the arrival of the coronavirus in the Washington, D.C., area 
March 9: ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"" — on Twitter.
March 10: ""And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away."" — after meeting with Republican senators
March 15: ""This is a very contagious — this is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something that we have tremendous control over."" — White House task force briefing
March 16: ""When I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with. We’re doing a very good job. … If you’re talking about the virus, no, that’s not under control for any place in the world. … I was talking about what we’re doing is under control."" — White House task force press briefing
March 17: ""I’ve always known this is a — this is a real — this is a pandemic. I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."" — White House task force press briefing
March 23: ""People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death. Probably and — I mean, definitely — would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus."" — White House task force briefing
March 24: ""I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" — Fox News virtual town hall
""I brought some numbers here, we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, ‘Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore.’ We have to get back to work."" — Fox News virtual town hall
March 29: ""But there were a lot of people that said — I thought about it. I said, ‘Maybe we should ride it through.’ You know, you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We’re in the midst of a bad flu season. … But this is different. And part of this is the unknown, and part of it also is the viciousness of it."" — White House task force press briefing
""So you’re talking about 2.2. million deaths — 2.2 million people from this. And so, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job. But 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that."" — White House task force press briefing
March 31: ""I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually, common sense, they said, ‘Why don’t we ride it out?’ A lot of people have said, a lot of people have thought about it, ‘Ride it out, don’t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu.’ But it’s not the flu."" — White House task force briefing
 
Correction, April 14: We originally said our timeline of Trump’s statements began on Jan. 24. It begins on Jan. 22.

		This week, a reader sent us a comment about our article on the research behind face masks and whether people who aren’t sick should use them to limit the spread of COVID-19. The article reviewed some of the research and thinking behind face masks and explained why opinions are divided.
In the FactCheck Mailbag, we feature some of the email we receive. Readers can send comments to editor@factcheck.org. Letters may be edited for length.

Wearing Face Masks in Public
Your article [""COVID-19 Face Mask Advice, Explained,"" April 6] really saddened me. You need to come to Asia.
I feel your article is only from a Western viewpoint. It is like no one considers what is happening here in Asia, with millions of people, and how everyone here is dealing with it, and successfully. Sure it is hard to get numbers out of China.
People live in high density like New York with many generations in the same rooms, but they each are doing their part for everyone. The virus came here very quickly as Chinese tourists are everywhere in Asia.
But look at the numbers……

Taiwan, 21 million people next to China- only 5 deaths!!!!
South Korea- 51 million people- only 192 deaths
Japan- 126 million people, 92 deaths
Hong Kong- 7.3 million- 4 deaths—right next to China. Connecting rail lines and roads
Singapore- 6 million- 6 deaths

Sure there are some special conditions in each of these examples, but as a group, so few deaths. Why?? Many reasons, one common simple behavior is they all wear a mask.
We are US citizens living 6 months a year in Thailand and travel in Asia. Have done so for 15 + years.
Everyone, yes everyone wears masks, here. You don’t go outside without it. Naturally we wash hands and keep distance, also. Sanitizer is offered in every shop.
Many people are still working and many shops are open. It is true if you shut everyone inside it will work, but can your economies take this? How many months? Who can afford this? And when you step out and don’t have a mask—more chance of restarting it. A mask protects both you and other people, given that no one knows who may have the virus, it’s essential. Its respectful.
Are Westerners just too vain to do this? Here, we don’t wear N95 masks. They are for health care workers. Many masks are homemade.
Walking down a street with everyone in masks is much safer. May not [be] perfect compared to a closed room.
Be careful, please wear a mask. It is how we respect our fellow citizens.

      Video: Trump’s Misleading Attacks on Cuomo

		In this video, we look at two misleading attacks President Donald Trump has lodged against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state has been dealing with an explosion of COVID-19 infections.

Hitting back at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pleas for the federal government to provide more ventilators, Trump misleadingly claimed Cuomo rejected a 2015 recommendation to purchase 16,000 ventilators and instead ""established death panels"" and ""lotteries."" 
Contrary to the president’s claim, a state task force in 2015 did not make a recommendation about purchasing more ventilators. That was outside the scope of the group, Valerie Gutmann Koch, the former senior attorney and special consultant to the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, told us via email. The report — ""Ventilator Allocation Guidelines"" — provided guidelines for New York hospitals on how they should decide which patients get ventilators in the event of a severe influenza pandemic.
Koch also said it is inaccurate to call the triage committees proposed by the New York task force ""death panels.""
""The 2015 ventilator allocation protocol is intended to save the most lives in an influenza pandemic where there are a limited number of available ventilators,"" Koch told us.
In a ""Fox & Friends"" phone interview on March 30, Trump also misleadingly noted that 4,000 ventilators delivered to New York from the federal stockpile are being kept in a ""warehouse which happens to be located – which is interesting — in Edison, New Jersey,"" suggesting New York didn’t need them. Cuomo said the ventilators are being stored in anticipation of peak demand in the coming weeks.
For more information about these and other misleading claims Trump has made about Cuomo’s response to the pandemic, see our stories, ""Trump’s Misleading Ventilator Counter-Punch at Cuomo"" and  ""Trump vs. Cuomo, Round 2.""

      Dueling Ads in the Kentucky Senate Race
      
      
         By Lori RobertsonPosted on May 22, 2020
      

    

    

    

      
      



      

        
        
        

          


	

		The Kentucky Senate race — likely pitting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell against Democratic challenger, and former Marine fighter pilot, Amy McGrath — is playing out on the airwaves. But the recent TV ads don’t always square with the facts.

In one ad, McGrath charges that McConnell opposed further federal relief to states hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, adding, ""It’s why he said we should just declare bankruptcy."" That’s not what McConnell said. The senator said bankruptcy should be a legal option for states facing money woes unrelated to the coronavirus, such as debt due to pension programs.
In another TV spot, the McConnell camp highlights a 2018 audio clip of McGrath saying, ""I am further left, I am more progressive than anybody in the state of Kentucky."" The McGrath camp charges the audio is ""doctored"" in a way to alter her meaning. Meanwhile, the McConnell camp hasn’t — and wouldn’t when we asked — release the full audio from the event, leaving the dispute at an impasse for fact-checking.
The McConnell camp also claims McGrath supports abortion ""even in the 9th month,"" pointing to a 2018 interview in which she didn’t answer whether she supported limitations. But she has since said she supports current restrictions.

McGrath, who unsuccessfully ran for a House seat in 2018, is vying to unseat McConnell, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and has been the Senate majority leader since 2015. Polls taken in January showed a possible general election race could be tight, assuming McGrath wins the party’s nomination. The Democratic primary is June 23.
McConnell’s ‘Bankruptcy’ and ‘Blue State Bailout’ Remarks
The McGrath TV ad, which began airing May 16, according to Advertising Analytics, features McGrath saying, ""What is leadership? And where are we seeing it in the middle of everything we’re going through right now?"" She then mentions Republican Govs. Mike DeWine of Ohio and Larry Hogan of Maryland, as well as Democratic Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.
Those politicians are ""showing us what real leadership is and political party has nothing to do with it. I lived this kind of leadership as a Marine,"" she said.
""But Sen. McConnell sees it differently,"" McGrath continues. ""He doesn’t want to pass what he calls ‘Blue State Bailouts,’ even though Kentucky would get badly needed help, too. It’s why he said we should just declare bankruptcy.""

The McConnell campaign issued a response ad on May 19, featuring an image of McGrath from her ad and claiming she was ""falsely attacking"" McConnell. McGrath has a point that the senator made the issue political with the ""blue state"" characterization — and as we’ll explain, he and some governors differ on what they’d like to see in future federal aid to states — but she misrepresents what he said about bankruptcy.
McConnell was criticized by governors of both parties for his remarks, made in an April 22 radio interview on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show,"" and his Senate office headlined part of his comments ""On Stopping Blue State Bailouts"" in a press release.
But he didn’t say that states — or Kentucky specifically — ""should just declare bankruptcy,"" as McGrath claimed. Instead, he said, ""I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,"" when asked about states with budgetary woes predating the pandemic.
While he hasn’t committed to another relief bill that would provide assistance to state and local governments — and in that radio interview said ""we’re going to push the pause button here, because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments need to be thoroughly evaluated"" — he also said a few days after that interview, ""There probably will be another state and local funding bill,"" and that Republicans ""are open to considering another bill.""
Here are McConnell’s remarks in the April 22 interview:
Hewitt, April 22: A lot of the state governments are going to be smashed up by this. But there is no Chapter 8 in the bankruptcy code. Who are you going to, you know, for states, no states can go bankrupt. Local governments can go bankrupt and reorganize. Who are you going to task to lead the effort on deciding what to do or not to do for the states?
McConnell: Yeah, well, I think it’s going to be a broad discussion without, you know, throughout the conference. I mean, we all represent states. We all have governors regardless of party who would love to have free money. And that’s why I said yesterday we’re going to push the pause button here, because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments need to be thoroughly evaluated. You raised yourself the important issue of what states have done, many of them have done to themselves with their pension programs. There’s not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations. 
So this is a much bigger conversation than we’ve had providing assistance for small business because the government shut them out, put them down, put them out of business, or assistance to hospitals which were overwhelmed by the COVID-19 disease. This is a very different decision. These are all taxing authorities, just like we are, and I think that’s why we need to have a fulsome conference-wide discussion among Senate Republicans before we go down this path.
Hewitt: I agree. I think people do not understand how badly mismanaged some states have been, and their unfunded liabilities. And if they were in the private sector, they would have to reorganize under the bankruptcy code. But there is no bankruptcy code chapter. Do you think that we need to invent one for states so that they can discharge some of these liabilities that were put in place by previous governors like, I mean, Jerry Brown ran a giveaway program for public employee unions that was just astonishing, and as did Gray Davis, as did, you know, a lot of Democratic governors, Illinois is probably the worst, and Connecticut. They’ve just given money away for years to people who aren’t working.
McConnell: Yeah, I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there’s no good reason for it not to be available. My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don’t have to do that. That’s not something I’m going to be in favor of.
The senator’s comments didn’t go over well with governors of both parties. Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, said, ""Mitch McConnell probably regrets saying that. If he doesn’t regret it yet, I think he will regret it. And I think he’s going to change his mind about that.""
Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, called the bankruptcy suggestion ""one of the really dumb ideas of all time,"" and objected to McConnell’s office framing the issue as a ""blue state bailout.""
Hogan and Cuomo, chair and vice chair, respectively, of the National Governors Association, had called for $500 billion in federal aid directly to the states to help cover ""drastic state revenue shortfalls"" due to the pandemic and stay-at-home orders meant to combat it. ""We must be allowed to use any state stabilization funds for replacement of lost revenue, and these funds should not be tied to only COVID-19 related expenses,"" the NGA said in an April 11 press release.
McConnell, in the April 22 interview and others, has said he wants any further state and local government funding tied specifically to COVID-19.
The McGrath campaign told us: ""In fact, Kentucky’s largest newspaper, the Louisville Courier Journal, reported that it was McConnell’s preference that states file for bankruptcy over large-scale federal aid,"" pointing to an article in the paper that said McConnell had said ""he would rather let state governments file for bankruptcy than give them a federal ‘blank check’ amid the coronavirus pandemic.""
In the radio interview, McConnell did say, ""we’re not ready to just send a blank check down to states and local governments to spend anyway they choose to. We had a tranche for them in the first bill, the $2.2 trillion dollar bill. It has to be coronavirus-related. And I think we need to have a full debate not only about if we do state and local, how will they spend it."" He added: ""Look, the only solution is ultimately to begin to open up,"" meaning allowing businesses to reopen.
But in subsequent interviews in the days after his ""bankruptcy"" comment, McConnell stressed that he was saying it should be ""an option"" and that he didn’t want any future federal aid to ""fix age-old problems"" in states ""wholly unrelated"" to the coronavirus pandemic.
""I wasn’t saying they had to take bankruptcy. I think it’s just an option to be looked at, that unfortunately states don’t have that option now, cities do,"" he said in an April 27 Fox News Radio interview. ""I wasn’t necessarily recommending it, but I was pointing out that they have their own fiscal problems that predate the coronavirus, and I was not interested in borrowing money from future generations to fix age-old problems that states have that they created themselves wholly unrelated to this.""
He said there ""probably will be another state and local funding bill"" and that ""we do want to help them with expenses that are directly related to the coronavirus outbreak."" But, he said, ""we need to make sure that we achieve something that will go beyond simply sending out money.""
In a Fox News TV interview on April 30, he said, ""I don’t think many states would choose that option,"" meaning bankruptcy. ""But the point is we’re not interested in borrowing money from future generations to send down to states to help them with bad decisions they’ve made in the past unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic.""
And he made similar comments in an April 27 Fox News interview, saying that ""we’re certainly open to considering additional assistance to state and local governments, that’s on top of what we have already done in the CARES Act.""
The CARES Act, or the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, provided $150 billion to state and local governments to ""offset expenses stemming from the pandemic,"" as an analysis of the legislation from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office described it.
In an op-ed published in the Courier-Journal on May 14, McConnell said Kentucky had received more than $1.7 billion and had ""flexibility"" to use the money for ""salaries of first responders, health care professionals and others fighting this pandemic,"" as well as the ""costs of testing and contact tracing"" or distributing money to Kentucky families. He also argued that the impact on the state from the legislation is greater than that, since the act included money for housing assistance, forgivable loans for businesses, airport funding and more. That’s the law that expanded unemployment benefits and provided rebates to Americans earning less than certain income thresholds.
But state and local officials, such as the NGA, have called for even more flexible funding that would allow them to cover tax revenue losses sustained because of the economic impact of the pandemic, losses that they warn could lead to layoffs of government employees and cuts to government services. On April 20, two days before McConnell spoke on Hugh Hewitt’s show, the Louisville Metro Council wrote to McConnell, asking for such ""general fund relief.""
The McGrath campaign noted the CARES Act ""did not include funding to cover states’ budget shortfalls due to the coronavirus pandemic"" and pointed us to a news article on an April 30 report from the Kentucky state budget director estimating the state could face up to a $500 million revenue shortfall this fiscal year, which ends June 30, due to the economic fallout of the pandemic.
We asked McConnell’s campaign if the senator supported additional funding that states could use to cover those coronavirus-related revenue shortfalls.
""Leader McConnell has repeatedly said further state and local assistance must be for problems brought on by the coronavirus pandemic,"" campaign Press Secretary Katharine Cooksey responded, citing another April 22 interview in which McConnell said, ""We’re interested in trying to help them with anything related to the coronavirus. … We’re going to weigh the impact of what we’ve already added to the national debt and make certain that if we provide additional assistance for state and local governments, it’s only for coronavirus related matters. We’re not interested in solving their pension problems for them.""
On May 11, McConnell said of the prospect of another coronavirus relief bill, ""We’re basically assessing what we’ve done already."" He told CNN, according to the cable network: ""I don’t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately. That time could [come], but I don’t think it has yet."" Four days later, the Democratic-controlled House passed another relief bill that includes nearly $1 trillion for states, cities and Native American tribes, but it faces Republican opposition. The New York Times described the bill as ""more a messaging document than a viable piece of legislation.""
So, McConnell hasn’t committed to the kind of flexible, not-tied-to-COVID-19-expenses relief some local and state officials, such as the NGA, have requested. And he, and his Senate office, have indicated he ""doesn’t want to pass what he calls ‘Blue State Bailouts,’"" as McGrath says in the campaign ad. But that glosses over the fact McConnell has said he’s ""open"" to further state and local aid, provided it’s coronavirus-related.
And the ad is wrong to claim he said Kentucky ""should just declare bankruptcy."" He said it should be a legal option for states facing budget woes unrelated to the pandemic.
McGrath’s ‘Progressive’ Quote
In its response ad, the McConnell campaign uses an audio clip of McGrath from a 2018 fundraiser saying, ""I am further left, I am more progressive than anybody in the state of Kentucky.""
In yet another TV ad, launched May 20, McGrath counters, ""Mitch McConnell wants you to believe"" she said that quote, ""but that’s ridiculous. It’s doctored audio.""

How is the audio doctored? The McGrath campaign told us: ""The audio has been edited to deliberately alter its meaning and Senator McConnell should release the entire audio.""
The McConnell camp used the clip last year as well. In a radio ad response, which the McGrath campaign shared with us, McGrath said McConnell ""cut out half the sentence."" She went on to say she was talking about ""not taking money from gun lobbyists"" and that she ""compared myself to anyone in Kentucky who had served in that office.""
The campaign also told us that it ""did not record that audio,"" when we asked if the McGrath camp could provide it.
We asked the McConnell campaign if it would share the full audio of the event with us, so we could settle the dispute. But we had no luck there, either.
Cooksey, the McConnell campaign press secretary, told us McGrath’s responses to the audio clip have been ""evolving.""
""Her 2018 campaign’s original response to this audio was to acknowledge that her views ‘on many things are pretty progressive.’ Then McGrath couldn’t recall the context of the quote, said ‘it was essentially a joke,’ and now she claims it’s doctored,"" Cooksey said.
But that’s not quite right. The full quote from her 2018 campaign manager in the first instance was that: ""Amy’s positions on many things are pretty progressive. Others are less so."" And he also said, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader, that he wasn’t sure of the context. That was in August 2018, after Rep. Andy Barr, whom McGrath was trying to unseat, used the clip, reportedly from a fundraiser in Massachusetts, in an attack ad.
In a September 2018 TV interview, McGrath was asked whether her comment was ""a joke"" by the reporter. She responded: ""That was, yeah, I mean, it was essentially a joke, but it was based off of one issue, right. And I was talking about the fact that I was more progressive than anyone who has ever held this seat, on a particular issue.""
We simply can’t determine whether McGrath has a legitimate complaint about the use of the audio clip without the full remarks, which the McConnell campaign wouldn’t provide.
The McGrath campaign noted that she ""was an independent for 12 years and considered running for Congress as an independent in 2018.""
The McConnell ad also claims McGrath is ""100% pro-abortion even in the 9th month."" McGrath responded to that in her ad as well, saying, ""Of course I don’t support late-term abortions.""
The McGrath campaign also told us the claim is ""false"" and that McGrath ""supports current federal restrictions on abortion.""
The citation in the ad is for an article about an April 2018 radio interview in which she doesn’t answer whether there should be any limitations on abortion when asked. But the campaign later said she respected current law, which includes restrictions, and McGrath herself has since said restrictions on abortion are ""reasonable"" and ""enough.""
""You don’t think there should be any limitations at all on abortion?"" radio host Larry Glover asked McGrath in the April 2018 interview, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. ""I don’t think government should be involved in making a decision on a woman’s body."" When pressed again — ""So you think a woman on the way to the hospital to give birth could decide to abort it instead?"" Glover asked — McGrath repeated her response: ""I don’t think the government should be involved in a woman’s right to choose what is happening to her body.""
But McGrath talked about supporting current restrictions in subsequent interviews. In an October 2018 interview with Lawrenceburg, Kentucky’s Anderson News, she said: ""The claim that I’m somehow for abortion in the ninth month is offensive and ridiculous. … There are ample restrictions on abortions and I am opposed to late term abortions (except when it comes to issues of the life of the mother)."" In a July 2019 interview with Louisville’s Courier-Journal, she said: ""I think there are enough restrictions on abortion and they’re reasonable. So right now, you can’t walk into a clinic eight months pregnant and get an abortion, you can’t do it and that’s reasonable.""
As we’ve written before, late-term abortions are rare. The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on abortions in the U.S. found that 1.2% were performed at or after 21 weeks gestational time, according to 2016 data, and 65.5% of abortions were performed in the first eight weeks of gestation. The CDC reported similar figures for 2015. 
Abortion restrictions vary by state; federal restrictions block Medicaid and other federal health programs from covering abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the woman’s life. Kentucky prohibits abortions after 20 weeks unless there’s a threat to the mother’s health. Forty-three states total have some type of gestational limit, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with exceptions for the health and/or life endangerment of the mother.
The ad also says McGrath ""wanted President Trump impeached,"" and it’s true she said, ""I would have voted to impeach and convict on both counts."" And it features a 2018 TV interview in which McGrath said building a border wall, as Trump supports, is ""absolutely stupid."" She went on to say that ""it’s a ninth century solution to a 21st century problem"" and that she would vote ""no"" on funding for a wall ""unless it came in some sort of package where we got DACA recipients to be full citizens.""

		Quick Take
Facebook posts make the unsubstantiated suggestion that the novel coronavirus is infectious in the air for ""8 hrs,"" and falsely claim that ""everyone is required to wear mask everywhere!"" There was no requirement for healthy people to wear masks when the claims were made; health officials later recommended wearing masks, and some states require them in public settings.


Full Story 
Update, July 14: This story was published before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began advising people to wear face coverings in public settings. Many states now have laws mandating masks in public settings. Our most recent coverage on COVID-19 can be found here. We have updated the Quick Take. The original story is as follows.
As the health care system in the U.S. faces shortages of face masks and other protective gear for workers fighting the novel coronavirus pandemic, some Facebook posts are sending the wrong message by claiming that wearing a face mask is now a requirement for everyone.
The posts falsely claim that ""everyone is required to wear mask everywhere,"" because ""COVID-19"" — the disease caused by the virus — ""is confirmed as airborne and remain 8 hrs in air!""
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend face masks for healthy people, but says they should be worn ""by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms."" It notes that the ""use of facemasks also is crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).""
So there’s no requirement that ""everyone"" wear a mask at all times.
The Facebook posts further leave a misleading impression when saying the coronavirus (formally known as SARS-CoV-2) is ""airborne and remain 8 hrs in air!"" The term ""airborne,"" we note, is used differently by different people and is the subject of some debate.
Public health officials have thus far said they do not believe the virus is widely spread through the air. But new studies suggest air transmission could be a factor, especially in health care settings.
A study published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine called aerosol transmission ""plausible."" The study involved an experiment using a nebulizer to show that the virus ""remained viable in aerosols"" for up to three hours. The term ""aerosol"" refers to virus particles being suspended in the air; more on that shortly.
But, importantly, the study estimated that the virus had a half-life of approximately 1.1 to 1.2 hours in aerosols — meaning half of the viral particles were no longer infectious after a little over an hour.
The amount of virus projected into the air would affect the total time that some of it remains infectious, according to Dylan Morris, a Princeton University researcher and co-author of the study. Certain conditions, such as humidity, could also affect how long it remains infectious.
The Facebook posts, however, leave the unfounded impression that the virus is infectious in the air for ""8 hrs."" A CNBC article referenced in the posts does not claim as much.
Morris told us by email that ""the ‘airborne’ question bedevils scientists trying to communicate with the public. It combines a locus of substantial public fear with a question of true scientific nuance — a recipe for a misinformation mess.""
""Many viruses — from measles to flu, and including SARS-CoV-2 — are ‘airborne’ in the sense that one way of getting sick is to inhale virus particles (‘virions’) sneezed or coughed into the air within respiratory secretions,"" he said. Some secretions are bigger (often called ""droplets"") and some smaller (thought of as ""aerosols""), he said, though there’s a spectrum.
""The tricky crux of the matter is that when people say ‘airborne’, what they often mean is ‘you’re at risk from virus particles hanging in the air — or being kicked back up into the air after falling to the ground — long, long after an infectious person sneezed them out,'"" he said. ""That’s much more of a risk for smaller, ‘aerosol’-end-of-the-spectrum secretions. And it turns out that it’s more of a risk for some viruses than for others.""
Measles is very airborne, he said, but the flu is less so — ""even though both measles and flu can in principle be found both in aerosol-like and in droplet-like secretions. So far, scientists mainly think COVID looks more like flu"" in that way.
Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, said we don’t have enough evidence of how exactly the coronavirus is being spread between people.
""We do know transmission is much more likely if you’re close to someone who’s sick,"" Marr said. In terms of the virus being potentially transmitted in the air, she uses the analogy of being directly next to someone smoking a cigarette; the farther away you are from someone releasing the virus into the air, the lesser the concentration.
""The ‘airborne’ term scares people — they envision this cloud of viruses that roams around the neighborhood that can infect them,"" she said. ""The important thing [to know] is that virus released in the air from a patient is usually quickly diluted unless you’re in a really small space."" And over time, the ""level of risk becomes much, much lower.""
Marr added that larger droplets could also land on the floor or a desk, surfaces which people may touch and then touch their faces or mouths — also putting them at risk of infection. That’s why public health officials stress frequent hand-washing.
And while the Facebook posts suggest the ""airborne"" factor necessitates the healthy public at large (""everyone"") wear masks ""everywhere,"" experts say it’s health care workers who truly need them most.
""Where nobody disagrees is that there are frighteningly plausible aerosol transmission risks in hospital settings, since medical procedures involved in treating COVID can produce aerosols,"" Morris said. ""This is a major reason why hospitals are in such critical need of appropriate protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers (e.g. N95 masks).""
Marr, too, said the limited supply is most needed by health care workers.
""If there is a shortage of masks, which is the case here, then they should be reserved for health care workers,"" she said. ""Even coughing, breathing and talking can generate aerosols,"" she said, so ""health care workers close to patients … should be wearing proper respiratory protection.""
Morris suggests that members of the public, some of whom could be infected but not show symptoms, can follow online tutorials to create their own surgical masks — covering the nose and mouth — to wear in public settings, like the grocery store. While such masks don’t prevent the person wearing it from becoming infected, they can help those who are unknowingly sick avoid inadvertently contaminating the environment.
In short, there is emerging evidence that the virus may be ""airborne,"" but that term requires context and experts say the primary concern is direct contact with people infected with the disease. And the idea that the virus remains infectious in the air for ""8 hrs"" is not supported — and there’s no requirement that people wear masks at all times.

		As scientists work to find a safe vaccine for COVID-19, President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have made competing claims about the administration’s plans to carry out the daunting task of distributing hundreds of millions of vaccine doses:

Biden goes too far when he claims the Trump administration hasn’t done ""any planning"" for vaccine distribution and has no ""command officer"" in charge of it. Trump put the Army’s top logistics officer in charge, and numerous federal officials are working on vaccination prioritization and distribution plans.
Trump, for his part, exaggerates when he says the Department of Defense is ""all mobilized"" and ""fully set up"" to distribute the vaccine. Planning is still underway. And, while the military is involved in distribution preparations and planning, we were told by the Department of Health and Human Services that ""DOD support may not be required at all"" for vaccination distribution.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, has infected at least 4.8 million people and killed more than 160,000 in the United States, according to the COVID-19 dashboard from Johns Hopkins University.
While the race for a vaccine is on, the Trump administration must figure out how to distribute more than 300 million doses — possibly more than 600 million doses, if the vaccine requires two doses — to reach everyone in the country.
Contrary to Biden’s claims, the administration has begun planning for the distribution of a vaccine and has a ""command officer"" in place.
The Department of Health and Human Services announced on May 15 that Army Gen. Gustave Perna would be the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed — a joint project of HHS and the Department of Defense that aims ""to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution"" of a COVID-19 vaccine. The goal is to have 300 million vaccination doses available by January.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is part of HHS, will recommend priorities for vaccination distribution. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in April formed a COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group to recommend priorities on how to distribute the vaccine. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine also have formed a committee to help the CDC ""in planning for equitable allocation of vaccines against COVID-19.""
HHS will use ""traditional vaccine distribution networks"" to deliver the vaccines, a senior HHS official told us on the condition that we not use the official’s name. The Defense Department will handle the logistics of distribution and manufacturing, including assembling the vaccination kits, according to a senior administration official who spoke anonymously at a July 30 background briefing.
But there’s no evidence that the military is ""fully set up"" to distribute a vaccine or that it will play a major role in the actual distribution of the vaccines, contrary to Trump’s remarks on July 28.
The amount of work that still remains to do was evident at the July 30 background briefing, where two senior administration officials described some of the biggest logistical challenges to delivering vaccines, such as planning ""for a multitude of scenarios,"" depending on the type of vaccine and the number of doses available; setting priorities when limited doses are available; and creating an IT system ""to keep track of every individual in the country who’s getting"" a vaccine. All of that work is in progress.
""At this time, the administration is working through the exact algorithms for the distribution and allocation of potential COVID-19 vaccines as it will not fully understand the performance of the vaccines until phase III trials are complete,"" the HHS senior official told us in an email on Aug. 4.
Dr. Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccines advisory committee, said he believes there is a plan, but he doesn’t know what it is — even after attending two briefings with Defense Department officials involved in the planning. 
""I don’t know if there is or isn’t [a plan]. I’m choosing to believe there is a plan – I can’t image they don’t have a plan,"" Offit said in a phone interview.
""I don’t think it is fair for Joe Biden to say there is no plan,"" Offit said. ""It is fair to say we don’t know what the plan is, and we may never know,"" because of the ""secretive culture of the Defense Department.""
Biden vs. Trump on Vaccination Distribution
In an interview on MSNBC’s ""The ReidOut,"" Biden criticized Trump’s leadership on preparations for vaccination delivery. 
Biden, July 20: In addition, I would suggest right now — and I have urged the president to do this — right now, there may be a vaccine, God willing, after the 1st of the year. We should have a command officer now. We should be spending $25 billion to put together exactly how that will be distributed to over 300 million Americans. How will we do that? Where will it go? How will we get it done well? It needs planning – planning. And without any planning between now and Election Day, now and the time we are sworn in, it’s going to make it incredibly more difficult to get anything done.
Nine days later, Biden unveiled his plan for racial equality at a speech in Wilmington, and once again he challenged Trump ""to put someone in charge"" of vaccination preparedness.
Biden, July 28: But I want to say it again, I’m going to keep saying it. The president, as we speak, should be starting and should have started three months ago to put someone in charge of how specifically, like waging a war. How are you going to distribute the vaccine when it arrives, when it arrives, when it’s there?
On the same day, Trump described a U.S. military that is ""fully set up"" to carry out its mission to deliver vaccination doses across the country.
Trump, July 28: We’ve dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter. So we’ll have 500 million doses. And, logistically, we’re using our military, our great military — a group of people; their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations — and they’ll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly. They’re all mobilized. It’s been fully set up.
When we asked what the former vice president meant by his remarks, the Biden campaign provided us with a long list of examples that it said showed ""Trump’s handling of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine has been marked by empty promises and a distrust of science & medicine."" The list mostly consisted of news articles, from February through July, of Trump’s ""empty promises"" to have a vaccine ""very soon.""
The campaign also provided a ""comprehensive vaccine plan,"" co-authored by Ezekiel J. Emanuel for the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Emanuel is a member of Biden’s coronavirus task force who was the special adviser for health policy to the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from January 2009 to January 2011.
""It’s self-evident what the vice president means,"" Biden spokesman Michael Gwin told us in an interview. ""The scope and scale of the challenge before us to develop a safe and effective vaccine, to manufacture it and all of its parts, and deliver it safely and effectively in the midst of an active pandemic is an unprecedented challenge. This administration has shown itself incapable of planning or managing any of the aspects of this crisis, despite the people they have ostensibly put in charge.""
The Biden campaign’s supporting materials and subsequent interviews with campaign officials cast doubt on the Trump administration’s ability to carry out the formidable task of distributing more than 300 million vaccine doses. But they do not support Biden’s claims that there hasn’t been ""any planning"" and there is no ""command officer"" in charge of the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine.
We also asked HHS to provide us with information on the administration’s plans to distribute vaccinations. The department sent us transcripts of Operation Warp Speed background briefings, an OWS fact sheet and list of contracts the administration has for the advance manufacturing of vaccine candidates.
Likewise, the HHS materials don’t support Trump’s claim of the military being ""fully set up"" to distribute vaccines, but rather show an administration that still has a lot of planning to do. And the military will have just a ""complementary role to the traditional vaccine distribution networks,"" as the HHS official told us.
Here we take a look at what we know so far about the administration’s plans for delivering a vaccine once it is available.
Operation Warp Speed
The goal of Operation Warp Speed is to begin manufacturing a vaccine even before it is authorized or approved for use, as explained in an HHS fact sheet. That would allow for wide distribution of the vaccine more quickly once it is proven to be safe and effective and receives all necessary government approvals. (The FDA must authorize or approve the vaccine and manufacturing process.)
""Rather than eliminating steps from traditional development timelines, steps will proceed simultaneously, such as starting manufacturing of the vaccine at industrial scale well before the demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety as happens normally,"" the fact sheet says. ""This increases the financial risk, but not the product risk.""
There are many people and agencies involved, including Perna, the Army general who was confirmed by the Senate earlier early July to be the chief operating officer of OWS. Moncef Slaoui, a former chairman of global vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline, is the project’s chief adviser.
Perna had been the commanding general of the Army Materiel Command, which is responsible for logistics, prior to his appointment.
In addition to the military, several federal agencies at the HHS are involved in the development and manufacturing of a vaccine, including the CDC, FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
Offit said he supports the concept of Operation Warp Speed. ""I give credit to the administration for doing this,"" he said. ""Vaccine is ultimately our way out of this.""
The administration has contracts with several pharmaceutical companies to mass produce their vaccine candidates at the government’s expense. On July 31, the administration announced a $2 billion agreement with Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline that will, among other things, provide for the production of 100 million vaccine doses, with an option to purchase an additional 500 million. Similar contracts were announced Johnson & Johnson for 100 million doses of its vaccine candidate and AstraZeneca for 300 million doses.
""If it doesn’t work, we throw it away,"" Offit said of the vaccines that fail to win government approval. ""That’s fine. I think that’s all good.""
Offit, however, expressed concern that Trump might short-circuit the licensing process and pressure the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for one or more vaccines prior to the Nov. 3 election.
Under the EUA process, ""the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products … to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases,"" as the FDA explains.
As an example of his concern, Offit cited the FDA’s decision in March to issue an EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, even though there was very little evidence that the drugs were safe and effective for COVID-19. Trump repeatedly advocated the use of the drugs for COVID-19, but less than three months later the FDA revoked its EUA because the drugs were found to pose a health risk and were ""unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19.""
In a June 8 opinion piece, Emanuel and Offit says researchers estimate that it should take ""at least another eight to 12 months to determine whether these coronavirus vaccines are effective."" They fear the FDA will issue an EUA for an unlicensed vaccine before the clinical trials are completed.
The administration has sent mixed signals on when a vaccine could be available.
Trump repeatedly has said a vaccine would be available ""by the end of the year,"" even suggesting recently that it may be ready well before the end of the year. ""We’re balancing speed and safety, and we’re on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year,"" he said at an Aug. 3 press briefing.
Three days later, Trump in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera said that it is ""possible before"" the election, ""but right around that time.""
NIH Director Dr. Frances Collins, who has called having a vaccine by the end of the year a ""stretch goal,"" told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer there’s not enough information yet to say when a vaccine may prove to be safe and effective.
""I don’t have a crystal ball. I think it would be amazing if, by the end of this year, we were able to say we have at least one of these that’s safe and effective,"" he said. ""And I’m cautiously optimistic about that. But trying to put a finer prediction on the timetable right now, I don’t think any of us have enough information yet to know how that’s going to shake out.""
The National Institutes of Health announced on July 27 that a phase three clinical trial has begun for the first vaccine candidate, which was developed by the biotech company Moderna Inc. and the NIH. About 30,000 volunteers who do not have COVID-19 are expected to participate in the trial, which will determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. A successful phase three trial is the final step needed for approval.
On the same day, Pfizer and BioNTech announced it would start a phase two/three combined trial that also will involve up to 30,000 volunteers.
There are five or six other vaccine candidates ""that the federal government is actively involved with is going into phase three trials over the next few months,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at an July 31 congressional hearing.
Even though Collins said it would be ""amazing"" to have a vaccine by the end of the year, a senior administration official held out the possibility of a vaccine being available by mid-October.
""This could be, you know, it’s theoretically possible we could have 10 million doses in the middle of October or the end of October. It may not be till the end of December, it may be in early January,"" the official said at the July 30 briefing. ""So the fine line we’re walking is getting the American people very excited about the potential of vaccines and then missing on expectations versus, you know, having a bunch of vaccines in the warehouse and not as many folks want to get it.""
Setting ‘Priorities’ for COVID-19 Vaccination
Once a vaccine candidate receives emergency use authorization or licensure from the FDA, the challenge will be to distribute the vaccines in a fair and equitable way.
Who will be among the first to be vaccinated?
The ACIP’s vaccine work group — which has 41 members and is chaired by Beth Bell, a clinical professor of global health at the University of Washington — has been working to answer that question since April.
Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi, of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, gave a presentation on COVID-19 vaccine prioritization at the work group’s June 24 meeting.
""Although the goal is to offer vaccine to the entire U.S. population, identifying priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination is essential to support vaccine implementation planning,"" Mbaeyi said at the meeting. ""This planning needs to begin prior to vaccine approval so that vaccine can be distributed without delay once available.""
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine announced on July 21 that they have formed a committee to assist the CDC and National Institutes of Health in developing an equitable distribution plan. It held its first meeting July 24.
Mbaeyi said the work group will use a tiered approach to vaccine prioritization based in part on a planning document for flu vaccines. She called the document, which was updated in 2018, a ""useful framework for adaptation for COVID-19 vaccine prioritization.""
These proposed objectives will guide the work group in establishing priority groups for vaccinations:

Ensure safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.
Reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality in the population.
Help minimize disruption to society and economy, including maintaining health care capacity.
Ensure equity in vaccine allocation and distribution.

At the July 30 briefing, a senior administration official said one of the biggest challenges to developing priorities and distribution plans is the uncertainty of knowing what vaccines will be approved for use.
Senior administration official, July 30: [W]hat I mean by uncertainty is we have to plan for a multitude of scenarios. Will the vaccine be effective in certain parts of the population and not effective in other parts of the population? What volume will we have at what period in time? Will we have simultaneous vaccines that we have to deal with? So, there is – will it be one dose or two doses? Some vaccines are one dose, some vaccines are two doses. The cold storage conditions under which we have to transport and store them are different by vaccine.
So when you do the number of combinations of all of those variables, you have a lot of complexity. We believe we are planning for all of them and there’s a number of components associated with planning for all of them.
The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, so the elderly will be a priority — if the FDA-approved vaccine works for them, a senior administration official said in the briefing.
The ACIP will make prioritization recommendations to the CDC director and HHS secretary ""in a transparent evidence-based process,"" Mbaeyi said at the June 24 meeting.
In a July 27 interview on CNN, Fauci said that’s the ""standard way"" for setting priorities for vaccination distribution that has been enhanced by the input of other health officials and agencies.
Distributing the COVID-19 Vaccines
Beyond planning to deliver the vaccine to priority groups, the administration needs a plan for making doses available for everyone.
On MSNBC’s ""The ReidOut,"" Biden questioned ""exactly how"" the vaccine ""will be distributed to over 300 million Americans,"" adding that ""without any planning between now and Election Day, now and the time we are sworn in, it’s going to make it incredibly more difficult to get anything done.""
It’s not true that there isn’t ""any planning"" for the mass distribution of vaccines; but no plan has been made public, and there have been mixed signals on how the administration will distribute vaccines.
Trump claimed that the military is ""fully set up"" to deliver the vaccines, and a senior administration official at the July 30 briefing seemed to confirm that the Defense Department is handling ""all the logistics.""
""The DOD is handling all the logistics of getting the vaccines to the right place at the right time and the right condition,"" the official said. ""And it’s not just the logistics of distribution it is the logistics of manufacturing and the logistics of preparing for manufacturing as well. And it involves things like kitting,"" referring to the assembling of the vaccination kits.
""So, you know, we’re in receipt and we’ll continue to be in receipt of hundreds of millions of needles, and syringes and vials. And all of those need to be prepared properly by type of vaccine,"" the officials said. ""The DOD is handling all of those logistics.""
An administration official said distribution will be different for COVID-19 vaccines.
""[T]his is going to be unlike the influenza vaccine where it’s largely a poll system — meaning, oh you know, a CVS or a Walmart says, ‘Send us 1,000 doses of this,’ and then we wait for the next order to come in,"" an administration official said at the July 30 briefing. ""We are going to be pushing the vaccines out hopefully to nursing homes, to seniors who are not ambulatory and stuck in their homes, to frontline healthcare workers, to meat packing plants, name it.""
The administration officials at the briefing offered assurances it will work, but no plans.
""I would say for anyone who’s served in the military or known someone that does, I really think we excel at operational planning and I think the key way to address uncertainty is plan every detail with every contingency,"" said a senior official, whose name is withheld at the administration’s request. ""And I think — I hope that, frankly, the American public can be reassured that, you know, I don’t see how we could work details more than we have been to address all of those different contingencies based on vaccine, as well as we learn, you know, which vaccine works best for which type of person.""
But when we asked HHS about distribution, a senior department official told us it would be using the ""traditional vaccine distribution networks,"" and the military may or may not have a ""complementary role."" A 2019 report by Deloitte — ""The role of distributors in the US health care industry"" — said drug distribution ""is highly concentrated among three traditional full-line distributors: AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson."" Since discussions are ongoing, HHS could not provide any information related to any pending contracts, the official said.
HHS official, Aug. 4: HHS will likely work with the traditional pharmaceutical distribution networks to accomplish this nationwide effort. The timing of those contracted efforts will be driven by drug manufacturing timelines to ensure vaccines are available to be distributed as soon as the FDA approves an EUA or drug licensure.
DOD may be called on to provide a complementary role to the traditional vaccine distribution networks where speed of response or distribution to remote sites requires DOD augmentation. DOD support may not be required at all and may be the exception, not the norm.
HHS gave a similar response to McClatchy in a July 29 story sent to us by the Biden campaign.
Biden’s point, the campaign said, is, ""You can’t take the administration at face value.""
""Trump said they are ‘all mobilized,’ quote ‘fully set up,’ [for distribution],"" Gwin, a Biden spokesman, told us. ""But you and I can’t fact check that. There is no plan.""
This concerns Offit, too.
""There wasn’t a clear plan for PPE, testing and contact tracing,"" Offit said, referring to shortages of personal protective equipment to hospital workers, delays in making COVID-19 tests available to the public and the failure of contact tracing in the U.S. ""And this is much harder than that.""
Offit said he believes there will be two or three vaccines and some may require two doses, meaning that the distribution system requires tracking people to make sure they get a second dose. That would be done by the CDC, a senior administration official said in the July 30 briefing.
""Things like postvaccination, tracking of patients will be handled as you could expect by the CDC,"" the official said. ""Some of the communications through the state and the state relationships [with] the state public health organizations will be handled through the CDC.""
One administration official said there is ""a huge IT component"" to the administration’s plans to distribute the vaccines and track those who receive doses.
""We will be leveraging a lot of private partners who already have a good deal of that in place,"" the official said. ""We are under negotiation with several of them, but suffice it to say, we are not developing all that from scratch.""
When we asked HHS for details on its information technology plans, we were told ""the administration is working to conclude a number of contracts,"" which will be made public ""as soon as it is possible.""
Offit said if one vaccine turns out to be more effective than another vaccine for certain population groups, such as the elderly, there will be ""different recommendations for different groups."" That will also complicate the CDC’s vaccination plans. Most vaccines are dispensed at such locations as hospitals, doctor’s offices, pharmacies, schools and at work, but the pandemic has largely shut down schools, and millions of Americans are working remotely or not working at all. 
""That is the challenge here,"" Offit said. ""What is going to be the point of care? How do you ID that people walking up to you are in a priority group, and how do you make sure there is a second dose?""
Offit added, ""I think even if they are incredibly detailed about how they are going to do this – it is still incredibly hard to do this.""
Update, Aug. 7: We added the the ""comprehensive vaccine plan,"" co-authored by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, was written for the Center for American Progress.

		Quick Take
A viral Facebook post makes the false claim that the nasal swab test for COVID-19 damages the ""blood-brain barrier"" and can therefore lead to brain infections. Medical experts say the swab test is completely safe. 
Full Story
To help control the spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended getting a COVID-19 test for people who show symptoms of the disease, have come into contact with someone known to have the disease, or are in vulnerable groups. 
The most common form of testing for the novel coronavirus involves the use of a nasopharyngeal, or nasal, swab. The swab reaches deep into the back of a person’s nose and mouth to collect cells and fluids from the upper respiratory system, which can then be checked with diagnostic tests for the presence of the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.
The testing procedure involves inserting a 6-inch-long swab into the cavity between the nose and mouth for 15 seconds and rotating it several times. The swabbing is repeated on the other side. The swab is then inserted into a container and sent to a lab for testing.
Dr. Shawn Nasseri, an ear, nose and throat surgeon based in Beverly Hills who has conducted many COVID-19 swab tests, told us in an email that the nasal swab ""follows the floor of the nose and goes to where the nose meets the throat, or naso-pharynx.""
Asked if the swab test is safe, Nasseri said, ""Absolutely. The biggest risk is discomfort. The rare person — 1 in thousands — passes out from being super sensitive or gets a mild nosebleed. It’s estimated that close to 40 million or more swabs have been performed safely in the U.S. alone.""
But in recent weeks, viral posts on Facebook falsely claim that the nasal swab test can cause serious health issues. One post says, ""The stick deep into the nose causes damage to the hamato-encephalic barrier and damages endocrine glands. This test creates an entrance to the brain for every infection.""
The hamato-encephalic barrier, also known as the ""blood-brain barrier,"" protects the brain from toxins that could be present in the blood. 
Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of epidemiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, told us in an email that the Facebook claim ""is not true.""
""I have heard about it before and consulted with neurosurgeons, neurologists and other physicians and no one has heard of this situation occurring or even likely,"" Maldonado said.
Nasseri said that ""it is incredibly implausible, if not impossible, to cross the skull base and blood-brain barrier with a swab unless someone uses a rigid metal instrument and is pointing the metal object 90 degrees in the wrong direction.""
Dr. Morgan Katz, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University, told the Associated Press that the Facebook posts misunderstand what’s happening when the swab test is performed.
The swab ""would have to go through layers of muscle and fascia, as well as the base of the skull, which is a thick bone, in order to get anywhere near the blood-brain barrier, and I would say that it is not possible,"" Katz said.

		Quick Take
An outdated video clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci is circulating on social media — giving the false impression he is currently advising the public not to wear face masks. Fauci, like other health officials, recommends wearing a cloth face covering when distances of at least six feet can’t be maintained.
Full Story
On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its earlier position on the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic and announced that it was now recommending that people should wear face coverings in public, citing new studies on the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.
""We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms,"" the CDC said in its announcement. ""In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.""
Despite the new guidance, dubious Facebook pages and groups — some of which advocate alternative medicines, conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination messages — have been recently circulating an outdated recommendation on the use of face masks. The pages are sharing a March 8 video clip from CBS’ ""60 Minutes"" showing Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying: ""There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.""
But at that point in early March, the CDC recommended conserving face masks, which were in short supply, for health care workers and those who had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. So, Fauci gave an answer that was in line with CDC recommendations at that time.
Here’s what Fauci told Dr. Jon LaPook, chief medical correspondent for CBS News, in the clip circulating on social media:
LaPook, March 8: There’s a lot of confusion among people, and misinformation, surrounding face masks. Can you discuss that?
Fauci: The masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else… Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.
LaPook: You’re sure of it? Because people are listening really closely to this.
Fauci: …There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.
LaPook: And can you get some schmutz, sort of staying inside there?
Fauci: Of course, of course. But, when you think masks, you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people who, when you look at the films of foreign countries and you see 85% of the people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m not against it. If you want to do it, that’s fine.
LaPook: But it can lead to a shortage of masks?
Fauci: Exactly, that’s the point. It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.
Since then, the science around the novel coronavirus has evolved, Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, explained in an interview with FactCheck.org.
In early March, so few patients had been tested that public health officials didn’t yet know that people could spread the virus without showing symptoms, said Winslow.
""That was just not known at that point,"" he said.
Winslow noted that Fauci appeared to be making two points in the interview. He was pushing back on the idea that a mask could protect the wearer from infection, and he was emphasizing the importance of other measures, such as maintaining a distance of at least six feet between people.
Both of those things still apply, according to the CDC, which explains on its website that the point of wearing a mask ""is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms.""
In appearances aired on PBS NewsHour on April 3 and May 12, Fauci again noted the importance of physical distancing and, in line with the evolving public health recommendations, added that cloth face coverings should be used in public.
But the Facebook pages didn’t share the more up-to-date interviews. Instead, they shared the old interview without noting the date.
For example, a Facebook page that supports the widely debunked conspiracy-theory video, ""Plandemic,"" shared the old clip on May 6 with the caption, ""Dr. Anthony Fauci: ‘There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.'"" That’s the opposite of the advice Fauci was giving by that time.

		SciCheck Digest
A highly viewed Facebook video distorts a CNN interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci to falsely suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S doesn’t ""protect you from covid."" The vaccine does protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus; Fauci was simply cautioning that it may not prevent someone from contracting the virus.

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How effective are the vaccines?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How effective are the vaccines?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

Full Story
A popular video that adds a voiceover to footage from a television interview with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci inaccurately questions the efficacy of one of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S.
""So the vaccine don’t protect you from covid ???"" reads the Facebook video post title. In fact, as Fauci explained in the interview, the vaccine does protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which sometimes does not make people sick.
The video, which has racked up more than 468,000 views and 14,000 shares, was posted by TAHO, a group that claims to be a non-governmental organization ""to encourage the youth in farming activities."" The group’s Facebook photo includes an image of a map of Africa, and the group is managed by individuals in Ghana and the United Kingdom. Many of its posts, including the Fauci video post, end with the phrase, ""African Youth Reflect.""
The video runs about two minutes long and contains a segment of an interview CNN’s Chris Cuomo did with Fauci on Dec. 10. The interview followed news that an independent advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration had voted that the benefits of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outweigh its risks — all but ensuring the agency would greenlight the vaccine. The next day, the FDA followed through and granted the vaccine an emergency use authorization, the first for any COVID-19 vaccine in America.
Another vaccine from the biotech company Moderna went through the same process a week later. That vaccine also protects against disease, but it’s not known yet if it prevents infection.
The clip begins with Cuomo asking Fauci why it will still be necessary to wear a face mask even after a person is vaccinated. Fauci explains this is because while the vaccine does an excellent job at protecting people from falling ill, it might not prevent infection — and initially there will still be a lot of virus circulating in the population.
""You could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected,"" he said. ""We’re not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected.""
Here, a voiceover cuts in to repeat Fauci’s last sentence in a suggestive tone, before allowing him to continue: ""We know for sure it’s very, very good, 94%, 95% in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease.""
At this point a voiceover interjects, ""Clinically recognizable disease, but not COVID?"" The question insinuates that there is something suspicious about what Fauci said, but there isn’t. He’s only making a distinction between disease and infection.
Specifically, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was tested in a phase 3 randomized trial in which people were counted as having COVID-19 if they developed at least one symptom of the disease, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus within four days.
Using this definition, which is quite inclusive, the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults.
Moderna’s vaccine, for which the general results were known at the time of the CNN interview, was similarly effective — 94.1% — based on a COVID-19 case definition of at least two systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills or headache, and one respiratory symptom, along with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2.
The trials, however, did not immediately evaluate how well the vaccines were able to prevent infection. This is particularly relevant for COVID-19, because while many people develop at least some symptoms, some proportion of people do not. It therefore remains possible the two-dose shot keeps people healthy — the primary goal for the vaccines — but that vaccinated people can still become infected and unwittingly transmit the virus. Hence, Fauci’s advice, at least for now, to continue to wear a mask and follow public health precautions, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also endorsed.
As we’ve written before, there is a good chance that the authorized COVID-19 shots will help limit transmission to some degree, as that is still common with vaccines that cannot shield against infection but do defend against illness. But it nevertheless remains an open question for the COVID-19 vaccines.
The video misleads again when the voiceover repeats Fauci’s statement that the vaccine protected people against ""severe disease"" and then asks, ""Well, then, what does he call COVID, if that’s not serious?""
That misunderstands COVID-19 and how differently it affects various people. As we’ve already noted, infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not always produce symptoms in people. For most individuals, the symptoms are relatively mild. But in some patients, particularly those who are older or who have certain health conditions, COVID-19 can be deadly — and for others, symptoms can linger.
Fauci was referring to the ability of the vaccine to prevent a severe case of COVID-19. In both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials, severe disease was defined as having confirmed COVID-19 and at least one sign of serious illness, such as a blood oxygen level below 93%, respiratory failure or admission to the intensive care unit.
In the Moderna trial, all 30 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group at the time of the FDA’s evaluation. One severe case was later identified in the vaccine group. Few volunteers in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial developed severe disease, making it difficult to come to firm conclusions, but as the FDA noted in its briefing, ""the case split does suggest protection from severe COVID-19 disease.""

If in fact Trump plans to hand over distribution responsibilities to the military, this will deliver a fatal blow to the possibility of widespread acceptance of vaccination, especially among African-American and Hispanic people. [""Dueling Trump, Biden Claims on COVID-19 Vaccination Distribution,"" Aug. 7.]
In the wake of Tuskegee, the mustard gas experiments on Black soldiers in World War II, the Agent Orange debacle, the threatened militarization of urban police forces, and so many other examples that can be cited, can you honestly envision most Black folks trusting this at all?

		At a White House briefing March 19, President Donald Trump said, ""Nobody knew there’d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion."" But that’s simply not the case.
Among others, the U.S. intelligence community warned in its annual threat report for 2019 that ""that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death.""
The president made his remarks at a coronavirus task force press briefing. Trump deflected the blame when asked about the lack of coronavirus tests and medical supplies to deal with the pandemic.

Trump, March 19:  They had an obsolete system, and they had a system, simultaneously, that was not meant for this.  It wasn’t meant for this. Nobody knew there’d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.  Nobody has ever seen anything like this before.

But experts have warned for years about the danger of a major, potentially catastrophic outbreak of global disease, and some have sounded the alarm that the United States was not prepared to cope with it.
""The threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,"" Luciana Borio, then-director of Medical and Biodefense Preparedness Policy at the National Security Council, said at a symposium at Emory University in Atlanta in 2018 marking the 100th anniversary of the devastating flu outbreak  of 1918. ""Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.""
Jennifer Horney, professor and founding director of the epidemiology program at the University of Delaware, told CNN, ""we’ve been planning for and anticipating a global event like this"" at least since the 2005 avian influenza outbreak.




After the novel coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China, last December and spread around the world, Trump consistently sought to downplay the danger to the United States, likening coronavirus to the flu and expressing confidence that it could go away once the weather warmed up. (See our story, ""Trump’s Statements About the Coronavirus."")
Only recently has the president begun referring to it as a major problem for the U.S. ""This is a pandemic,"" he said at a March 17 press conference. ""I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""
Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor at Harvard University, told us that there was plenty of evidence that a disease of this kind posed a serious threat and that the notion that it could not be foreseen is off base.
""Three years ago, experts were saying that bat coronaviruses could become a new pandemic,"" he said in an email. ""Almost two months ago, experts were saying that the new virus in Wuhan was potentially a global threat. One month ago, experts were saying that it was likely to be pandemic, and the White House’s response was that this was under control, despite the fact that the US’s lack of testing was demonstrably giving a false picture of the extent of infection. This was foreseeable, and foreseen, weeks and months ago, and only now is the White House coming out of denial and heading straight into saying it could not have been foreseen.""
The likelihood of a pandemic has been clear to experts for quite some time.
Back in 2012, the RAND Corp. issued a report called ""Threats Without Threateners? Exploring Intersections of Threats to the Global Commons and National Security."" That report focused on five risks — nuclear proliferation, conflict in the Middle East, water scarcity, pandemics and climate change.
Of the five, it said, ""In current circumstances, only pandemics seem to be an existential threat, capable of destroying America’s way of life.""
The report said that ""a future pandemic may be virtually certain,"" adding, ""its timing and severity are not."" To underscore the need to focus on the subject right away, the document said, ""Pandemics are a real possibility in the here and now; there is nothing future about them.""
A week before the Trump administration took office in January 2017, Obama administration officials focused on the dangers of a pandemic in a briefing for top Trump aides, according to Politico. One of the possible scenarios sketched out included a fast-spreading global disease leading some countries to impose travel bans.
In an article in Foreign Affairs, Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, wrote, ""We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.""
The U.S. intelligence community’s Worldwide Threat Assessment for 2019 also aimed a spotlight on the probability of a pandemic.
""We assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support,"" the report said.
The report said it anticipated ""more frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases because of rapid unplanned urbanization, prolonged humanitarian crises, human incursion into previously unsettled land, expansion of international travel and trade, and regional climate change.""
And, it warned, ""though the international community has made tenuous improvements to global health security, these gains may be inadequate.""
In its assessment the year before, the intelligence community warned — presciently — that a ""novel strain of a virulent microbe that is easily transmissible between humans continues to be a major threat.""
It is not possible to predict when a pandemic will occur, but Trump is wrong to say that ""nobody knew"" a ""pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion"" could happen.

		President Donald Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. This time, the president falsely claimed that ""people with lupus"" who take hydroxychloroquine ""aren’t catching this horrible virus.""
While it’s too early to say whether or not hydroxychloroquine has any protective effects, it’s not true that no lupus patients have developed the disease. In fact, the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance’s registry of COVID-19 patients with rheumatologic disease had 110 validated patients, as of April 2, and 17% of them have lupus.
""We can say that this drug is likely not 100% effective in preventing or treating COVID, and that SLE [systemic lupus erythematosus] patients should not let their guard down,"" Dr. Jean Liew, administrative lead for the alliance, told us in an email.
Trump made his remarks at a coronavirus press briefing on April 4. The president has said he is a ""big fan"" of using hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment — even though, as we have reported, there is limited evidence yet that it works.
Trump, April 4: We’re just hearing really positive stories, and we’re continuing to collect the data. But I’ll just speak for myself: It’s been out for a long time. It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for lupus. And there’s a — there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus. They’re not — they’re not affected so much by it. Now, maybe that’s correct; maybe it’s false. You’re going to have to check it out.
We did check it out.
The White House did not offer any support for the president’s claim that ""people with lupus aren’t catching"" the coronavirus. However, there is evidence from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance that he is wrong.
The international alliance was formed to ""help guide rheumatology clinicians in assessing and treating patients with rheumatologic disease."" The alliance — which is supported by the Lupus Foundation of America, Lupus Research Alliance and the American College of Rheumatology — has called on clinicians to report ""all cases of COVID-19 in rheumatology patients, including those with mild or no symptoms."" 
As of April 2, the group had information on 110 validated patients: 36% with rheumatoid arthritis, 17% with psoriatic arthritis and 17% with systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, an autoimmune disease. 
""One frequently asked question: over 25% of patients who developed a COVID-19 were on HCQ at the time of diagnosis,"" the group said in a tweet thread on April 2, referring to hydroxychloroquine.
""Based on early data currently available in our registry, we are not able to report any evidence of a protective effect from hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19,"" the group said in an April 4 tweet. To be clear, that doesn’t mean there isn’t one — but there aren’t signs so far, and ultimately, the question will have to be answered in a randomized controlled trial.
Although the data does show that lupus patients get COVID-19, Liew cautioned us that ""there are many caveats to making further inference from registry data,"" especially since ""this is a voluntary registry and will not capture all patients living with rheumatic disease, such as lupus, who test positive for COVID-19.""
Liew also said that Trump may have been referring to an unpublished study out of China on the effects of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.
That study, which was posted to medRxiv on March 30, said: ""Interestingly, through a follow-up survey, we found that none of our 80 SLE patients who took long-term oral HCQ had been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection or appeared to have related symptoms."" SARS-CoV-2 is the official name of the virus that causes COVID-19.
""The authors do not provide details about the survey, such as whether there was a larger number of lupus patients surveyed (the denominator), out of which 80 were able to respond and say they did not have COVID-19,"" Liew pointed out. ""We cannot draw any causal conclusions from those data, either.""
In the April 4 press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked ""what you’re seeing as far as lupus patients, in regards to coronavirus."" Fauci said, ""We don’t have any definitive information to be able to make any comment that that — it’s an obvious good question, because it might be a way for us to get some interesting and potentially important data as to the role of those medications. But that’s something that is now being looked at, but we don’t have any data to be able to say anything definitively.""
That has been a consistent message from the experts: It’s still unknown whether hydroxychloroquine is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. More study is needed.
Several clinical trials are planned in the U.S. to test hydroxychloroquine’s ability to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such study — a multi-site clinical trial that is being led by the University of Washington School of Medicine — will seek to determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results won’t be known until, at best, this summer. 
Until more is known, the Lupus Foundation of America urges lupus patients — and there are about 1.5 million Americans with the disease — to protect themselves as best they can from the highly transmissible coronavirus.
On the day that Trump made his false claim about lupus patients, the Lupus Foundation of America put out a statement that said, ""There is no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is effective in preventing a person from contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19). People with lupus should follow the guidance of their doctor and the safety guidelines being issued by the CDC.""

		Quick Take
A viral Facebook post falsely claims that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""wouldn’t release 8.5 billion for Coronavirus without abortion funding."" A House bill providing $8.3 billion in relief was already signed into law. The ""abortion funding"" claim is a distortion of a separate debate over a different bill.


Full Story 
A behind-the-scenes skirmish between Republicans and Democrats over language in a House bill providing relief amid the novel coronavirus pandemic recently prompted claims by both sides that the measure was being politicized. Specifically, news reports cited an apparent debate over whether the bill could open the door to federal funds being used for abortions.
Ultimately, though, the House passed the bill — the Families First Coronavirus Response Act — on March 14, and most Republicans voted in favor. The Republican-led Senate then approved it on March 18 and President Donald Trump signed it. There is nothing in the bill specific to the issue of abortion and, in fact, language was added to make clear that additional funding would be subject to restrictions in existing spending laws. 
But some on social media have distorted the facts, claiming that ""Nancy Pelosi wouldn’t release 8.5 billion for Coronavirus without abortion funding, so Trump went around her to declare a National Emergency and got 50 billion.""
That’s false.
The viral Facebook post, shared by more than 50,000 users, conflates and confuses provisions contained in separate legislative proposals.

For starters, the ""8.5 billion"" refers to a different bill — the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act — that the Democrat-controlled House passed on March 4. It provides $8.3 billion for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak (which was more than the $2.5 billion originally requested by the White House). The Republican-led Senate approved the measure the next day, and President Donald Trump signed it into law on March 6, days before the post appeared on Facebook.
So it’s false to say Pelosi refused to ""release 8.5 billion for Coronavirus."" And Trump’s declaration of a national emergency over COVID-19 came days after that money was approved, on March 13. It provides access to more than $42 billion for states and localities — and is in addition to the $8.3 billion.
The Facebook claim instead refers to reports of a conflict over language in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. That legislation, projected to cost more than $100 billion, provides free coronavirus testing, including for the uninsured (it does not cover treatment relating to the coronavirus) and mandates paid sick leave by some employers (though there are loopholes), among other provisions.
The abortion issue surfaced in a story on the conservative website the Daily Caller, which cited anonymous White House officials and claimed that ""Pelosi sought to include a potential way to guarantee federal funding for abortion into the coronavirus economic stimulus plan."" More specifically, it said Pelosi wanted to spend ""$1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.""
Republican Sen. Ben Sasse also issued a statement claiming that Pelosi was ""politicizing emergency funding by fighting against the bipartisan Hyde Amendment."" The Hyde Amendment is reauthorized annually as an attachment to the appropriations bill for the Department of Health and Human Services to prevent funds from Medicaid and federal health care programs from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.
The issue was characterized differently by the other side of the debate. 
Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, for example, claimed Republicans were trying to put ""pro-life provisions"" into the bill. (Note: Quote is at 5:25 in the video.)
A House Democratic aide told us the conflict arose because the original version of the bill outlined the funding for laboratory tests as mandatory spending, rather than discretionary spending, and did not tie it to specific agencies, whose appropriations are subject to Hyde Amendment provisions.
That squares with what Republican Rep. Kevin Brady’s deputy chief of staff, Jeff Billman, told us.
Billman said in an email that ""an earlier iteration of the bill provided $1 billion to a program that did not contain Hyde protections,"" but said changes were made to provide the funding through a HHS office ""covered by the Hyde Amendment contained in the Labor HHS (LHHS) appropriations bill."" 
Billman cited the inclusion of a section in the new version of the bill that notes that ""the additional amounts appropriated by this Act to appropriations accounts shall be available under the authorities and conditions applicable to such appropriations accounts for fiscal year 2020.""
There was evidently a disagreement over the significance of the issue, though.
Billman said the Democrats ""attempted to overturn over four decades of bipartisan consensus on Hyde Protections against taxpayer-funded abortion which was Rep. Brady’s concern."" (Brady ultimately voted in favor of the bill, saying ""pro-life Hyde Amendment protections remain intact."")
The House Democratic aide we spoke with, on the other hand, said there was no back-door effort to fund abortions through the bill; the aide cast doubt on the idea that it would have set a precedent of health care spending without Hyde. Pelosi’s office declined to comment.
Either way, Pelosi was not holding up the release of ""8.5 billion for Coronavirus without abortion funding,"" as the Facebook posts claim.

		At a July 20 Senate hearing, Republican Sen. Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, once again had a testy exchange over whether the U.S. funded gain-of-function research in China, with each man accusing the other of ""lying.""
Paul also suggested that the research was tied to ""4 million people dying around the world"" from COVID-19, but then backed off the implication, saying, ""No one’s saying those viruses"" studied in the paper in question ""caused it.""
Most of the exchange was like a flashback to the clash between the two men at a May 11 Senate hearing, which we’ve written about. But the senator also made a false claim about theories on the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.
Paul said that ""all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab,"" but there is no evidence linking the novel coronavirus to a lab — only speculation. As we’ve explained, many scientists with expertise in coronaviruses consider a lab escape unlikely and a natural spillover of the virus from an animal to a human the most likely scenario, based on the data we have so far. Several of those scientists summarized their reasoning in a July 7 paper, which has not yet been peer reviewed.
We’ll recap here what we’ve written about the contention between Paul and Fauci. For more, we refer readers to our two stories on these topics: ""The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement"" and ""The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus.""
Gain-of-Function
As we wrote in May, there’s no dispute that some U.S. funding went to China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. The disagreement is over whether the research the lab conducted with the money was gain-of-function research.
Nearly $600,000 from a National Institutes of Health grant to the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance went to the Wuhan lab, a collaborator on the six-year project to study the risk of the future emergence of coronaviruses from bats. The grant was canceled in April 2020.
The NIH, EcoHealth Alliance and the lead researcher in Wuhan all say the experiments weren’t gain-of-function — a type of research the U.S. government generally defined in 2014 as aiming to ""increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility."" 
There’s no evidence that Fauci lied to Congress, as Paul asserted in the July 20 hearing, given that the NIH unequivocally backs up Fauci’s statement that the grant-backed research ""was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function.""
In a May 19 statement, NIH Director Dr. Francis S. Collins said that ""neither NIH nor NIAID have ever approved any grant that would have supported ‘gain-of-function’ research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans.""
Scientists have differing opinions on what counts as gain-of-function research, however, and which experiments would yield valuable insights into pathogens and how to combat them, and which are not worth the risks.
Paul cited Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University and a critic of gain-of-function research, who disagrees with the NIH. Ebright has said that the EcoHealth/Wuhan lab research ""was — unequivocally — gain-of-function research."" And Paul cited a 2017 paper, published in the journal PLOS Pathogens partly thanks to funding from that EcoHealth Alliance grant.
The paper was published shortly before the U.S. government lifted a three-year pause on gain-of-function research ""that may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route,"" per the White House’s 2014 announcement.
Paul, July 20: This research matches, indeed epitomizes the definition of gain-of-function research, done entirely in Wuhan, for which there was supposed to be a federal pause. Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th, where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan.
Fauci: Sen. Paul, I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement. This paper that you were referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function.
Again, the NIH says the EcoHealth grant didn’t fund gain-of-function research. ""No dispensation was needed as no gain-of-function research was being conducted,"" a spokesman for EcoHealth told us.
The 2017 paper, authored primarily by Wuhan Institute of Virology researchers including Shi Zhengli, determined that bat coronaviruses in a cave in Yunnan, China, had ""all of the building blocks"" of the SARS coronavirus, which caused an outbreak in 2003. Shi is famous for her work tracking down the origins of the SARS epidemic.
The authors ""speculate that the direct ancestor"" of the SARS virus may have been a result of recombination — or the natural combining of genetic material — of precursors of these bat coronaviruses. And the authors found that the bat coronaviruses had the potential for direct transmission to humans.
A few of their experiments combined different elements of viruses to better understand what’s required to infect human cells. Specifically, the 2017 research used the backbone of WIV1, a bat SARS-like virus reported in 2013, and swapped in the spike protein of two newly identified bat coronaviruses to see if they, like WIV1, can use the human ACE2 receptor to enter human cells. The researchers found that both chimeric viruses could use ACE2 to infect and replicate in human cells in culture. (The researchers attempted to make six other chimeric viruses, but when put into monkey cells the viral constructs did not replicate.)
Is that gain-of-function? Again, there are different definitions and opinions on that. We reached out to the NIH asking for a more detailed explanation of why the 2017 paper didn’t meet its definition, and we’ll update this story if we get a response.
We’ll note that Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa who studies coronaviruses, told us that in the type of research conducted under the EcoHealth grant ""these viruses are almost always attenuated,"" meaning weakened. He also said that making a virus that could infect human cells in a lab doesn’t mean the virus is more infectious for humans. Viruses adapt to the cell culture, he said, and may grow well in a cell culture but then not actually infect animals very well.
For her part, Shi told the New York Times in June that her lab had never conducted experiments ""that enhance the virulence of viruses.""
The Origins of SARS-CoV-2
In the July 20 hearing, Paul, again, tied the U.S. funding of the Wuhan lab to the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and after the hearing, the hashtag #FauciLiedPeopleDied began trending on Twitter. But as Fauci correctly said, there’s no evidence the lab had a coronavirus that could possibly be manipulated enough to lead to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to several experts. Paul then said he wasn’t implying that.
Here’s part of that exchange:
Paul: It’s a dance, and you’re dancing around this because you’re trying to obscure responsibility for 4 million people dying around the world from a pandemic.
Fauci: I have to … well, now you’re getting into something. If the point that you are making is that the grant that was funded as a sub award from EcoHealth to Wuhan created SARS-CoV-2, that’s where you were getting. Let me finish. …
Paul: We don’t know if it didn’t come from the lab, but all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab, and there will be responsibility for those who funded the lab, including yourself. …
Fauci: I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating, senator, because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments that were given in the annual reports that were published in the literature, it is molecularly impossible.
Paul: No one’s saying those viruses caused it. No one is … We’re saying they are gain-of-function viruses, because they were animal viruses that became more transmissible in human and you funded it. And you won’t admit the truth. …
Fauci: And you are implying that what we did was responsible for the deaths of individual. I totally resent that.
Paul: It could have been. It could have been.
Fauci: And if anybody is lying here, senator it is you.
There’s no evidence that the Wuhan laboratory, with or without funding from an NIH grant, created SARS-CoV-2.
Many scientists remain open to a lab escape of a natural virus, but fewer entertain the notion that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered. While this cannot be ruled out entirely, multiple coronavirus experts view this as implausible. And the only way SARS-CoV-2 could have come from the lab, whether manipulated or a naturally occurring virus, is if the Wuhan lab was in possession of a virus much more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than the coronaviruses that have been identified.
Robert F. Garry, a virologist at Tulane University School of Medicine, told us a coronavirus would have to be ""at least 99%"" similar to SARS-CoV-2 and ""probably"" 99.9% similar ""to make that kind of switch in the lab at all."" 
""There’s just no evidence,"" he said, that the Wuhan Institute of Virology ""had anything close to that.""
Shi announced in late January 2020 that a bat virus the lab named RaTG13 shares 96.2% of its genome with SARS-CoV-2, which is the highest percentage of any known virus. But experts say speculation that RaTG13 could have been changed to become SARS-CoV-2 is misplaced. 
That’s because RaTG13’s genome still differs from SARS-CoV-2 by more than 1,000 nucleotides. ""RaTG13 is too divergent to be this ancestral virus,"" David Robertson, the head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow, told us.
Shi says there is only a genome sequence for RaTG13 anyway — live virus was never isolated from the sample.
Notably, other teams have subsequently found three other bat viruses that are more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13 when factoring in viral recombination — although they, too, are not precursors to the virus.
Paul claimed: ""We don’t know if it didn’t come from the lab, but all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab."" That’s not the case.
""On lab-leak, there’s no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab other than the coincidence of the Wuhan Institute of Virology being there,"" Robertson told us. 
Many scientists who study coronaviruses say what data we do have points to a natural spillover as the likely origin, given the presence of similar viruses circulating in bats, the links of many of the first COVID-19 cases to animal markets in Wuhan and past spillover events with other coronaviruses. But without identification of a near-identical virus in a bat or other animal, scientists cannot be completely certain.

		Quick Take
A fabricated tweet attributed to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez advocates extending COVID-19 restrictions on businesses ""until after the November Elections."" There is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez sent the bogus tweet, which was shared — and later deleted — by a Florida congressional candidate and a Fox News host.
Full Story
A phony tweet attributed to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is circulating online.
This is just the latest bogus tweet aimed at the New York Democrat; we’ve written about two others since she took office in 2019.
The recent fake tweet is being shared as a screenshot meme on various social media platforms, including Facebook, spreading the falsehood that she posted this message about the restrictions imposed on businesses because of the COVID-19 pandemic: ""It’s vital that Governors maintain restrictions on businesses until after the November Elections because economic recovery will help Trump be re-elected. A few business closures or job losses is a small price to pay to be free from his presidency. #KeepUsClosed""
But Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter account shows no such post.
Some versions of the falsehood account for that by claiming that she deleted the tweet, but ProPublica’s log of her deleted tweets also shows that she deleted no such tweet. And a screen capture of her Twitter account that day on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine doesn’t show the tweet, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s account shows that she didn’t tweet anything on May 20, the date given in the phony tweet, but she did retweet four posts referencing her appearance that evening on ABC’s ""Nightline,"" where she was interviewed about the impact of COVID-19 on essential workers. Ocasio-Cortez advocated extending hazard pay for those workers.
""Two bucks an hour means the world to workers. It means nothing to Jeff Bezos,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on the show, referring to the billionaire who owns Amazon. ""So, why don’t we just give folks the actual wages that they deserve.""
Although Ocasio-Cortez didn’t post the tweet, Florida congressional candidate Jessi Melton and Fox News personality Mark Levin did post the bogus claim. They later deleted their tweets.

		Quick Take
An economics professor’s flawed interpretation of U.S. mortality data has prompted a viral, false claim that COVID-19 hasn’t led to more deaths than normal this year. In fact, multiple analyses have found there to be a higher-than-normal number of deaths during the pandemic — as much as 20%, according to some studies.

Full Story
Viral headlines and social media posts are propelling the erroneous claim that there have been ""no excess deaths"" in the U.S. this year, suggesting that concern over COVID-19 is overblown.
That’s wrong.
As we’ve previously explained, excess deaths are deaths above the number expected in a given time period. The metric in the context of COVID-19 can help assess the impact of the pandemic, including by capturing direct and indirect effects of the virus. It can account for unreported COVID-19 deaths and for other factors — such as people dying from other causes, say avoiding medical attention, as well as drops in other deaths due to pandemic-related restrictions.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in October published a report that found that from late January through Oct. 3, there were an estimated 299,028 excess deaths. Two-thirds were estimated to be directly attributed to COVID-19.
The COVID-19 death toll has surpassed 275,000, as of Dec. 3, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Cases are rising around the country, and projections anticipate that the death count will climb past 300,000 by the end of the year.
The viral claim about ""no excess deaths"" — which has been amplified by unreliable websites and disseminated on Facebook and Twitter — stems from an online presentation by an economics lecturer at Johns Hopkins. But it’s flawed for multiple reasons, experts say.
In a Nov. 13 webinar, Genevieve Briand, the assistant director for the university’s Applied Economics master’s program, looked at select CDC data, such as weekly reported deaths, to reach the faulty conclusion that there is ""no evidence that COVID-19 create[d] any excess deaths.""
""Total death number are not above normal death numbers,"" she claims. ""We found no evidence to the contrary.""
Her claims were then relayed in a story in the Johns Hopkins News-Letter, a student-run publication, which said the analysis showed COVID-19 ""has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States."" The publication later retracted the report. An archived version of the story, however, has been shared on Facebook 10,000 times according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
The student publication’s retraction also became part of the false narrative online, triggering claims that the university had published a ""study"" then retracted it. ""Johns Hopkins Study Mysteriously Disappears after it Revealed, In Spite of COVID, No More Deaths in 2020 Than In Prior Years,"" read the false headline on the Gateway Pundit, a far-right website known for spreading misinformation.
Briand, however, confirmed in an email to us that she had not published her analysis anywhere apart from the webinar. The video is still available on YouTube, where it’s been viewed more than 58,000 times. Briand told us she stood by her analysis.
But Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Population Health at the Virginia Commonwealth University, told us that ""multiple studies have shown that total deaths in the US are about 20% higher than expected.""
Woolf and colleagues relayed as much in an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October. ""Although total US death counts are remarkably consistent from year to year, US deaths increased by 20% during March-July 2020,"" the authors wrote.
Studies from others, including a paper by two University of Oxford economists, have reached similar conclusions.
Woolf said in an email that the lecture video instead presented a ""very unsophisticated analysis, in which the speaker uses crude death counts for one year (2018) as the basis for comparison and performs simple subtraction from 2020 values for her assertions. Any reputable analysis of excess deaths is based on statistical modeling that computes seasonal averages over a period of many years, and this is done to adjust for random variation from year to year.""
""For example, our studies use Poisson regression modeling. Statistical modeling is necessary to know whether differences in death counts are statistically significant,"" he said. ""The speaker admits to merely eyeballing the trend lines for 2020. Researchers prefer to use statistical modeling to know whether a supposed change in counts is random variation or a statistically significant trend.""
The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics excess death analysis (which uses such modeling) has found deaths above normal rates week after week since the end of March — as readers can see in the center’s chart below.
<a href='https:&#47;&#47;www.cdc.gov&#47;'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CO&#47;COVID_excess_mort_withcauses_11252020&#47;WeeklyExcessDeaths&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a>                   
 
Briand’s video doesn’t consider that analysis or any other previous studies on the issue.
Instead, she looks at some public CDC data and, in part, homes in on a spike in deaths in spring 2020, observing that it does not correspond with an increase in all deaths — such as heart disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, influenza and pneumonia — as was the case during a spike in deaths in early January 2018.
""Our death number increased in 2020 and we have less heart attack than in 2018,"" she said. ""Where have all the heart attacks gone?""
But she’s misleadingly comparing different points in time for the two years.
Bob Anderson, chief of NCHS’ Mortality Statistics Branch, said in an email statement that the video’s claims are born out of ""a fundamental lack of understanding of the seasonal nature of mortality.""
While deaths typically increase in the winter, peaking around the New Year, ""[d]eaths then decline in the spring through the summer and then increase again in the fall through the winter,"" Anderson said. ""But, what we are seeing in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic is very different. In the spring of 2020, during a period where we normally should be seeing declining mortality, deaths continued to increase and were at unusually high levels through the spring.""
The comparison of the two time periods used in the video is ""not appropriate,"" he said.
Anderson added that in 2018, ""deaths followed the normal pattern (although at a higher level than normal). In 2020, deaths did not follow the normal pattern … they should have been declining in the spring, but instead increased substantially. In addition, we have an additional peak in deaths in late July/early August that seems to have been completely ignored in this analysis.""
""With regard to heart disease, it is true that heart disease deaths did not increase in April 2020 to the same extent that they did in January 2018,"" he said. ""But, in January, heart disease deaths are normally at a peak. In April, heart disease deaths are normally on the decline. Even so, the number of heart disease deaths has been largely above normal throughout the pandemic. The same is true for other causes of death, especially diabetes, hypertension, and dementia.""
So far this year, through the week ending Nov. 21, there have been 598,659 reported heart disease deaths in the U.S. — according to incomplete, provisional death count data published by the CDC on Dec. 3. In all of 2018, there were 655,381 deaths from heart disease. 
In response to an inquiry about Briand’s claims, Johns Hopkins University spokeswoman Karen Lancaster said in a statement that ""[w]hen individuals associated with Johns Hopkins exercise the right of expression, they do not speak on behalf of the institution.""
""As set forth in the Johns Hopkins University Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom, academic freedom ‘is designed to afford members of the community the broadest possible scope for unencumbered expression, investigation, analysis, and discourse,’ all of which must be subject to the scrutiny of peer review,"" she said.
Lancaster added: ""Johns Hopkins University continues to have grave concerns regarding the extraordinary toll of death and illness wrought by COVID-19 and remains committed to contributing our expertise in responding to this continuously escalating global health crisis.""

		1Q: Are hospitals inflating the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more?
A: Recent legislation pays hospitals higher Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients and treatment, but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting.

FULL QUESTION
Are hospitals getting 13,000 per patient if they write that on the diagnosis is COVID19 on the patient’s chart, and 35,000 for each patient if they are on ventilators?
I keep seeing posts in social media claiming that hospitals are over-stating covid-19 deaths because the they are paid more for these deaths … The YouTube video link here is attributed to Fox News with the headline ""US: Hospitals Get Paid More to List Patients as COVID-19…"" Can you provide any clarification?


FULL ANSWER
A Minnesota state senator’s recent interview on Fox News about Medicare payments for COVID-19 hospitalizations has generated a frenzy of headlines on social media suggesting that hospitals may have a financial motivation when it comes to classifying cases or deaths as related to COVID-19.
One website ran a story headlined, ""US Hospitals Getting Paid More to Label Cause of Death as ‘Coronavirus.'"" It called the information ""disturbing"" and the interview ""bone-chilling.""
Numerous readers have asked us about such claims, some of which imply that hospitals are making money by simply listing patients as having the disease — when in fact the payments referenced are for treating patients. And while some of the posts imply that fraud may be afoot, multiple experts told us that such theories of hospitals deliberately miscoding patients as COVID-19 are not supported by any evidence. 
The initial comment was made by Minnesota State Sen. Scott Jensen, a family physician, who spoke with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on April 8 about the idea that the number of COVID-19 deaths may be inflated. Jensen was responding to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, who — while answering a reporter’s question about that theory — said ""you will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises. They are nothing but distractions.""
Jensen, April 8: I would remind him that anytime health care intersects with dollars it gets awkward. Right now Medicare has determined that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital, you’ll get paid $13,000. If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000, three times as much. Nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things impact on what we do.
In an interview with FactCheck.org, however, Jensen said he did not think that hospitals were intentionally misclassifying cases for financial reasons.
But that’s how his comments have been widely interpreted and paraded on social media. One YouTube video with Jensen’s interview, viewed 42,000 times, was titled ""US: Hospitals Get Paid More to List Patients as COVID-19…"" That video was then posted in a Facebook group called ""X22 Report [Geopolitical]"" with a caption referencing the specific dollar amounts that read in part: ""This also explains the inflated amount of covid deaths."" Nearly 3,000 users shared the video from that post.
""So, hospitals get an extra $13,000 if they diagnose a death as COVID-19,"" a widely shared meme on Facebook claimed. ""And an additional $39,000 if they use a ventilator!"" One post of the meme, shared by hundreds, was captioned: ""And then we wonder why the numbers of deaths are embellished…""
The figures cited by Jensen generally square with estimated Medicare payments for COVID-19 hospitalizations, based on average Medicare payments for patients with similar diagnoses.
Medicare — the federal health insurance program for Americans 65 and older, a central at-risk population when it comes to COVID-19 — pays hospitals in part using fixed rates at discharge based off a grouping system known as diagnosis-related groups.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has classified COVID-19 cases with existing groups for respiratory infections and inflammations. A CMS spokesperson told us exact payments vary, depending on a patient’s principal diagnosis and severity, as well as treatments and procedures. There are also geographic variations.
An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation looked at average Medicare payments for hospital admissions for the existing diagnosis-related groups and noted that the ""average Medicare payment for respiratory infections and inflammations with major comorbidities or complications in 2017 … was $13,297. For more severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support for greater than 96 hours, which was $40,218.""
It is true, however, that the government will pay more to hospitals for COVID-19 cases in two senses: By paying an additional 20% on top of traditional Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients during the public health emergency, and by reimbursing hospitals for treating the uninsured patients with the disease (at that enhanced Medicare rate).
Both of those provisions stem from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act.
The CARES Act created the 20% add-on to be paid for Medicare patients with COVID-19. The act further created a $100 billion fund that is being used to financially assist hospitals — a ""portion"" of which will be ""used to reimburse healthcare providers, at Medicare rates, for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured,"" according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
As the Kaiser analysis noted, though, ""it is unclear whether the new fund will be able to cover the costs of the uninsured in addition to other needs, such as the purchase of medical supplies and the construction of temporary facilities.""
Either way, the fact that government programs are paying hospitals for treating patients who have COVID-19 isn’t on its own representative of anything nefarious.
""There’s an implication here that hospitals are over-reporting their COVID patients because they have an economic advantage of doing so, [which] is really an outrageous claim,"" Gerald Kominski, senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told us. And, he said, any suggestion that patients may be put on ventilators out of financial gain, not medical need, ""is basically saying physicians are violating their Hippocratic Oath … it would be like providing heart surgery on someone who doesn’t need it.""
Robert Berenson, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute, said the notion that hospitals are profiting off the pandemic — as some of the social media posts may imply — isn’t borne out by facts, either.
Berenson said revenues appear to be down for hospitals this quarter because many have suspended elective procedures, which are key to their revenue, forcing some hospitals to cut staff. He surmised that potential instances of patients being wrongly ""upcoded"" — or classified as COVID-19 when they’re not — are ""trivial compared to these other forces that are affecting hospital finances.""
Berenson and others we spoke with also said that hospitals have profound disincentives for ""upcoding,"" which can result in criminal or civil liabilities, such as being susceptible to being kicked out of the Medicare program.
Jensen himself said in a phone interview that he was not alleging widespread medical fraud.
""Do I think people are misclassifying? No,"" Jensen said. He said his concerns centered on what he deemed ""less precise standards"" for certifying deaths promulgated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and how deaths classified as COVID-19 without corroborating positive test results could lead to an over-counting.
The CDC guidance says that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, ""if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty."" It further indicates that if a ""definite diagnosis of COVID–19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.'""
""If we think it’s presumptive … we can go ahead and put down COVID-19,"" Jensen said, ""or even in some situations, even if it’s negative."" He pointed to the example of a 38-year-old man in Minnesota whose death was attributed to the coronavirus even though he tested negative.
The man’s mother, however, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that doctors determined the test result was likely a false negative. It’s not known exactly how common false negatives are in the U.S., but public health experts and doctors have raised concerns about many instances of tests showing negative results even when all other indicators point to COVID-19.
Fact sheets for different COVID-19 tests from the Food and Drug Administration note that a ""negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19. When diagnostic testing is negative, the possibility of a false negative result should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The possibility of a false negative result should especially be considered if the patient’s recent exposures or clinical presentation indicate that COVID-19 is likely, and diagnostic tests for other causes of illness (e.g., other respiratory illness) are negative.""
As for the accuracy of the death toll, other experts have previously  told us that while it’s true that some deaths attributed to COVID-19 likely would have occurred regardless of the disease, other factors — like the deaths of undiagnosed COVID-19 victims, including those that occur at home — contribute to a more significant problem of under-counting the deaths. 
New York City recently added more than 3,700 victims to its death toll to account for presumed cases. The CDC’s national count now makes note of how many cases and deaths were deemed ""probable."" 
Jensen said he actually believed there could be both instances of under-counting and over-counting of COVID-19 cases and deaths — but said that ""if there’s an over-count it’s conceivable that that could down the road translate to increased dollars in terms of some of the recovery dollars from COVID-19.""
When it comes to the $100 billion fund to help providers, future grants by HHS are supposed to focus on providers in areas hit hard by the outbreak, among others. But the initial allocation of $30 billion from that $100 billion fund to assist hospitals wasn’t distributed in that way. Instead, it was based on prior Medicare business.
A Kaiser Health News analysis found that the distribution of that initial $30 billion resulted in hospitals in states less affected by the pandemic — such as Minnesota, Nebraska and Montana — being given funding that worked out to be about ""$300,000 per reported COVID-19 case."" In New York, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases, the grant money amounted to ""only $12,000 per case.""

		Quick Take
Viral posts wrongly suggest that the COVID-19 death toll is exaggerated because ""the state"" has instructed that ""anyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident"" be listed as a coronavirus victim. Experts say there is no such default classification — and that the U.S. death count is probably underestimated.


Full Story 
Many experts believe the number of deaths linked to the novel coronavirus in the U.S. is likely higher than the figures available — due to factors such as an insufficient number of tests and inconsistent reporting across locales.
One Facebook user has claimed the opposite, erroneously suggesting the count is being inflated by unrelated deaths, and copies of that claim have gone viral on the social media platform.
The repeatedly shared posts — citing the user’s purported recollection of a woman’s claim on a ""live broadcast"" — argue that ""the state"" has instructed ""that anyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident"" should be ""listed as covid 19 victims."" It claims ""the numbers are a lie"" and calls for an investigation.
We attempted to contact the user responsible for the original post, to no avail, so we don’t know what ""state"" was being referenced. But there’s no evidence that any state has adopted a policy to classify all deaths, regardless of the individual circumstances, as being related to COVID-19.
Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, called the allegation ""ridiculous.""
""Death certificates are basically federal, and each state has a public health division that answers to the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for death certification,"" Aiken, the Spokane County, Washington, medical examiner, told us in an email. ""For all practical purposes death certification is directed by the feds, via health departments.""
Contrary to the Facebook posts, Aiken said, ""Medical Examiners and Coroners certify hundreds to thousands of deaths each year, using investigation, autopsies, and medical tests as required, and do not choose a ‘default diagnosis’ such as COVID-19.""
Aiken pointed out that CDC offers guidance to public health officials on the certification of COVID-19 deaths. The latest guidance was issued April 2. 
""If COVID–19 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the [underlying cause of death], as it can lead to various life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"" the guidance says. ""In these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it.""
The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, ""if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty."" It further indicates that if a ""definitive diagnosis cannot be made … but it is suspected or likely … it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.'""
One hypothetical example cited by the CDC is an 86-year-old woman dying after exhibiting symptoms such as a high fever, severe cough, and difficulty breathing, ""after being exposed to an ill family member who subsequently was diagnosed with COVID-19."" The CDC says that ""probable COVID-19"" may be listed as the underlying cause of death — a deduction made ""given the patient’s symptoms and exposure to an infected individual.""
There was renewed attention given to the theory of the death toll being inflated after Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said during an April 7 press conference that ""if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.""
Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner of New York City and a high-profile pathologist, told Fox News that it’s reasonable to include people with the virus, who also had other health issues, in the count.
""In the normal course, autopsies would then determine whether the person died of the effects of the COVID virus, whether the person had a brain tumor or brain hemorrhage for example that might be unrelated to it and what the relative significance of both the infection and the pre-existing disease is,"" he said. Even if the number of autopsies being conducted are low because of concerns of infection, he said, ""then you will include in those numbers some people who did have a pre-existing condition that would have caused death anyway, but that’s probably a small number.""
Likewise, Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told us in an email: ""There are going to be some people who die of something else, happen to have COVID and get tested, and get counted as COVID deaths but would die anyway. It would be wrong to say that number is zero. However given current testing shortages and protocols, the number of such cases will be small.""
""A greater issue is errors in the other direction — deaths caused by COVID that are not counted as such,"" he said.
Lipsitch cited at least two reasons for that underreporting: Someone having and dying from clear COVID-19 respiratory symptoms but never being tested (especially early in the epidemic, when tests were scarce). Or, he said, someone dying from causes, such as a heart attack or stroke, triggered by the infection — with no one ever suspecting or testing for the disease.
This is not an isolated issue: A 2013 study of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the U.S. found that lab-confirmed tests accounted for only about 1 in every 7 deaths attributable to the disease.
""So overall it seems likely that while a few individuals who would have died anyway are getting called COVID deaths, there are [many] more deaths caused by COVID that are not being attributed to COVID,"" Lipsitch said. And it is ""simply not true that anyone who dies of something other than a car accident or gunshot wound is attributed to COVID.""
In New York City, an epicenter for the outbreak with more than 4,000 reported deaths, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had not been counting the many deaths happening at home if the individuals had not been confirmed to have the disease. After a WNYC and Gothamist report on a sharp increase in the number of daily deaths happening at home in the city — and the suspected undercounting of cases — city officials said they would begin to include suspected cases in their counts.
Gary Watts — the coroner for Richland County, South Carolina, and president of the International Association of Coroners & Medical Examiners — also told us that the notion that the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are somehow being inflated didn’t make sense to him.
Watts said in a phone interview if an individual with a pre-existing condition, such as a heart disease or COPD, gets the virus, ""COVID-19 is going to be a very detrimental complication to your already existing disease."" Someone could live for years with COPD, for example, then die within weeks after getting COVID-19. In such cases, when the person is confirmed to have the virus, COVID-19 would be listed as a contributing factor.
In terms of known COVID-19 related deaths in hospitals, Watts said hospitals certify deaths and report that information. He said his office is only conducting postmortem tests for COVID-19 in limited cases — if the decedent was healthy, for example, and family indicated he or she had COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Watts said the purpose is to determine the cause of death but also ""as a safety precaution for the first responders"" who had contact with the individual. But if there was a clear cause of death — say, a stabbing — with no relation to COVID-19, Watts said he would not include the disease, even if the decedent tested positive.
""If it was not related to the cause of death, then I’m not going to list it,"" he said.
As of April 8, there have been more than 14,000 COVID-19 related deaths reported in the U.S., according to a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
""The true facts are that COVID-19 deaths will likely be underreported on death certificates and not over-reported,"" Aiken said. ""This will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount. Not all jurisdictions are able to test home deaths with typical symptoms for COVID-19.""

      The White House Spins Trump’s Disinfectant Remarks

		At an April 23 press briefing, President Donald Trump mused about the possibility of using ""very powerful light"" and injecting disinfectant into the body to kill COVID-19 – a suggestion that, in the case of disinfectant, was roundly criticized by experts as dangerous. A day later, he said he was being ""sarcastic.""
There’s no clear indication in his remarks that Trump was joking, either in his initial comment or when he returned to the topic later in the briefing. But we’ll leave it for readers to judge.
The Briefing
At the briefing, William Bryan, who leads the science and technology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, addressed the media about recent DHS research on how well the coronavirus survives on nonporous surfaces in heat, humidity and sunlight. Bryan said the ""virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight"" and also talked about the testing of disinfectants that quickly kill the virus on surfaces.
Trump then spoke about the powers of sunlight and disinfectant, turning at times to address Bryan.

Trump, April 23: A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it’d be interesting to check that. So that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful.
Here, Bryan responded to a reporter’s question about injecting a cleaner into the body, and Trump backtracked on his previous speculation about an ""injection"":

ABC News chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, April 23: The president mentioned the idea of a cleaner, bleach and isopropyl alcohol emerging. There’s no scenario where that could be injected into a person, is there?
Bryan: No, I’m here to talk about the finds that we had in the study. We don’t do that within that lab at our labs.
Trump: It wouldn’t be through injection. We’re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t work. But it certainly has a big effect if it’s on a stationary object.
Later in the briefing, Trump suggested applying ""light and heat to cure,"" and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, responded to Trump’s question by saying she hasn’t heard of heat or light ""as a treatment.""

Trump, April 23: I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure. You know — if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can’t. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can’t. I’m not a doctor. But I’m like a person that has a good you know what. Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?
Birx: Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as — I’ve not seen heat or light …
Trump: I think it’s a great thing to look at. I mean, you know. Okay?
The Day After the Briefing
The following morning, after numerous press reports cited experts calling the injection or ingestion of disinfectants dangerous, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a statement claiming Trump’s words had been taken ""out of context.""
""President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing,"" McEnany said. ""Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.""
That morning, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams also issued this warning via Twitter, ""A reminder to all Americans- PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/ medication to yourself or a loved one. Your safety is paramount, and doctors and nurses are have years of training to recommend what’s safe and effective.""
Later in the day, Trump claimed his comments the previous day were ""sarcastic.""

Reporter, April 24: Can you clarify your comments about injections of disinfectant?
Trump: No, I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you, just to see what would happen.
Now, disinfectant, or doing this, maybe on the hands, would work. And I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday — Bill — because when they say that something will last three or four hours or six hours, but if the sun is out or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday? But I was asking a sarcastic — and a very sarcastic question — to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside. But it does kill it and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters. Okay.
Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.
Trump: Uh, no, no, no, no.
Reporter: Were you being sarcastic with them?
Trump: To look into whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands, but whether or not sun can help us because, I mean, he came in yesterday and he said they’ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn’t where he hasn’t done it. This is where they’ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact, negatively, on this vir– in other words, it does not live well with humidity, and it doesn’t live well with sun — sunlight — heat. It doesn’t live well with heat and sun and disinfectant. And that’s what I brought out. And I thought it was clear. Okay. Anything else?
Although Trump said he told Bryan ""to look into whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands … can help us,"" that is not what the video shows. At the briefing, Trump didn’t say anything to Bryan about hands.
Turning to Bryan, Trump said at the briefing, ""And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it’d be interesting to check that.""
Again, we didn’t detect any sarcasm – and we aren’t alone in that – but since sarcasm is subjective, we’ll leave it to readers to make up their own minds about the president’s intent.

      FactChecking Biden’s CNN Town Hall
      
      
         By Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore, Jessica McDonald and Lucía OssesPosted on July 22, 2021
      

    

    

    

      
      



      

        
        
        

          


	

		In a prime-time town hall aired on CNN, President Joe Biden overstated some facts and misled on others.

The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing symptomatic disease, hospitalizations and deaths from the disease. But no vaccine is 100% effective, as Biden suggested in contradictory remarks.
Biden also overstepped when he referenced the delta variant. It’s not yet clear whether it is ""more deadly.""
He overstated the percentage of fully vaccinated people in the U.S. older than 50. But he was close if considering those who had received at least one shot.
The president made a misleading claim about his administration creating more jobs to date than previous administrations. On a percentage basis, job growth was slightly higher during the same five-month period of Jimmy Carter’s presidency in 1977.
Biden said ""the cost of an automobile is kind of back to what it was before the pandemic."" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index for new and used cars in cities was up about 20% between January 2020 and June of this year, but a car price expert says that’s partly because people are buying bigger, more expensive cars.
Although Americans’ trust in the federal government has ticked up a bit since 2019, it’s at about the same (low) level under Biden as it was late in Donald Trump’s presidency. Biden cited the small uptick, which some may have taken to mean there has been improvement since he took office.

The town hall was broadcast on July 21 from Cincinnati, Ohio.
Vaccine Effectiveness
The COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. are highly effective in preventing symptomatic disease, hospitalizations and deaths from the disease. But no vaccine is 100% effective, as Biden suggested in the town hall and afterward in contradictory remarks.
""Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn’t been vaccinated,"" Biden said. The percentages from that example generally check out.
In a July 1 briefing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that ""preliminary data from a collection of states"" since January indicated that ""99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in these states have occurred in unvaccinated people.""
In a July 16 press briefing, Walensky also said, ""This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" noting that ""over 97% of people who are entering the hospital right now"" with COVID-19 ""are unvaccinated.""
The Associated Press similarly reported in late June that ""nearly all"" — or about 99.2% — of the people in the U.S. who died from COVID-19 in May were not vaccinated. The unvaccinated accounted for nearly 99% of the COVID-19 related hospitalizations that month, as well, the AP said.
But Biden then went on to suggest the vaccines were 100% effective in preventing hospitalizations and death, despite the figures he gave indicating there would be some, albeit few, breakthrough cases. ""This is simple, basic proposition. If you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in an ICU unit, and you are not going to die,"" he said.
After the town hall, in speaking with reporters, Biden again echoed the words of the CDC director, saying that ""this virus is only killing primarily those people who had not been vaccinated."" But later went on to say he knew of no breakthrough cases that led to hospitalization or death.
Biden was asked what he would say to Americans who were fully vaccinated but still contracted COVID-19. ""There are very, very, very, very, very, very few people — number one,"" Biden responded. ""Those that it happened to, I don’t — it may be possible — I know of none where they’re hospitalized, in ICU, and/or passed away. So, at a minimum, I can say that even if they did contract it — which I’m sorry they did — it’s such a tiny percentage, and it is not life-threatening.""
The CDC and AP figures show that COVID-19 deaths among vaccinated individuals are a very tiny percentage of deaths from the disease. But there have been some.
Delta Variant
Biden also overstepped when he referenced the delta variant. 
""We’re not in the position where we think that any virus, including the delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of unvaccinated people, the — the various shots that people are getting now cover that,"" he said. ""You’re OK. You’re not going to — you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.""
As we’ve just explained, the vaccines are not perfect, so Biden can’t guarantee that a vaccinated person won’t fall ill with COVID-19.
Against delta, the vaccines remain remarkably resilient, especially in protecting against severe disease, but there appears to be a drop-off in effectiveness against symptomatic disease — and several studies have emphasized the importance of receiving both doses of the mRNA vaccines.
Public Health England, for example, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 21 that the real-world effectiveness of two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fell from 93.7% against the alpha variant to 88.0% against delta in preventing symptomatic disease — a modest decline. But with only one dose, the effectiveness dropped more, from 47.5% to 35.6%.
In an unpublished study from Canada, researchers estimated the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against delta to be 87% after two doses, while a report from Scotland, published in the British medical journal the Lancet, pegged the figure at 79%.
Meanwhile, in Israel, the health ministry released information on July 5 suggesting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 64% effective against infection or symptomatic illness, but still 93% effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization.
Biden is also on shaky ground when he says the delta variant is ""more deadly."" It’s possible the variant is more dangerous than previous versions of the virus, but that’s still far from clear.
One study from Scotland, published in the Lancet in June, found the risk of hospitalization with the delta variant was almost double that of the alpha variant, but the finding was preliminary. 
In its latest assessment of the variant, posted on July 8, Public Health England stated that analyses continued to suggest an increased risk of hospitalization relative to alpha, but there was no evidence of increased severity ""once in hospital"" — and there was a ""high level"" of uncertainty about this.
The CDC, notably, does not list increased virulence as a feature of the delta variant on its website. 
As we and others have explained, it can be difficult to pin down whether a viral variant that is more transmissible is also inherently more dangerous, or whether its ability to sicken and kill more people is just related to its increased contagiousness or to other features, such as who is falling ill.
Certainly, delta’s easier spread is still concerning, as it can lead to more deaths in a population, but it’s premature for Biden to say the variant is ""more deadly.""
Vaccinations for the Over-50 Crowd
Biden overstated the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals older than 50. But he was close if considering those who had received at least one shot, according to CDC data.
Biden said, ""We’ve made sure that since I got in office, we’ve inoculated over 160 million people, 85% of people over the age of 50.""
Biden’s first comment is correct. The CDC’s COVID Data Tracker shows that nearly 162 million people in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, as of July 21. Around 187 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine.
But Biden exaggerated when he followed up his figure on those fully vaccinated by saying, ""85% of people over the age of 50.""
If considering only the percentage of people over 50 who have been fully vaccinated, then the president overstated the group’s vaccination rate by more than 12 percentage points. According to CDC data from July 21, 79.7 million people older than 50 have been fully vaccinated. The CDC report, which cites 2019 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, lists the total number of residents over 50 at 109.8 million individuals. That’s 72.6% of people in the age group that have been fully vaccinated.
Biden’s statement was close, however, if considering the percentage of people over 50 who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. As of July 21, 89.8 million people over 50, or 81.8% of those in the age group, had gotten at least one shot, just a few percentage points shy of the 85% value claimed by the president.
Perhaps that’s what Biden meant to say. But he used the statistic in conjunction with the figure for those who are fully vaccinated.
Another Shaky Jobs Comparison
Biden made a misleading comparison about job growth during the current and past presidential administrations.
""We’ve created more jobs in the first six months in our administration than any time in American history,"" Biden said. ""No president has ever, no administration has ever created as many jobs.""
While Biden referenced his first six months in office, currently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics only has data for five of the six months that Biden has been in office. The data show that, from January, when Biden was sworn in, to June, total nonfarm employment increased by a little more than 3 million workers.
We assume Biden meant to compare only the first five months of his administration to the first five months of other newly elected presidents. That would be similar to another Biden talking point that we fact-checked in May.


The more than 3 million jobs added so far under Biden is indeed the most jobs added in the same January-to-June period of any newly elected administration since 1939, which is as far back as the BLS data go. The nearly 1.8 million increase in employment during the first five months under President Jimmy Carter in 1977 is the second largest increase in that time span.
However, on a percentage basis, the growth in jobs under Carter was slightly better than the increase under Biden to date.
Since Biden has been president, total nonfarm employment went up by about 2.1% from January to June, BLS data show. Under Carter, employment grew by 2.2% during the same period in 1977. 
Comparing the percentage increase — rather than raw numbers — helps account for changes in the size of the labor force and the overall population over time.
Car Prices
Asked about rising inflation, particularly in the gas and auto industry, Biden said that ""the cost of an automobile is kind of back to what it was before the pandemic.""
In fact, new and used car prices are significantly higher than they were before the pandemic.
A global shortage of microchips has slowed manufacturers’ production of cars, driving up prices of new cars. And that, in turn, has led to escalating used car prices as well.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index for new and used cars in cities was up about 20% between January 2020 (pre-pandemic) and June of this year. The CPI for used cars and trucks, alone, for urban buyers was up nearly 43% between January 2020 and June of this year.
According to Edmunds.com, an auto sales data provider, the average transaction price for new vehicles reached $40,827 in the second quarter of this year, up about 5.8% since March 2020. The bump in average used car prices is even higher, rising about 25% over the same period to $25,410 in the second quarter. Even high-mileage cars (between 100,000 and 110,000 miles) are fetching record amounts, Edmunds reports.
""Tighter inventory and fewer discounts in the new car market are pushing shoppers to seek a reprieve in the used market, and this consumer behavior is what’s also driving used car prices to astronomical levels,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ executive director of insights, in a press release. ""Car shoppers are used to getting deals, and often far below the sticker price for new, so anyone returning to the car market for the first time in a while is in for some serious sticker shock.""
But Talia James-Armand, a spokesperson for Edmunds, said those average prices are a bit deceptive.
""Average transaction prices are really high right now because people are opting to buy bigger, more expensive vehicles,"" James-Armand told us in a phone interview. ""They are opting to buy optioned-out trucks and SUVs instead of more affordable sedans. That’s what is kind of inflating prices right now.""
Trust in Government
The public’s trust in the federal government is at about the same low level in the early months of Biden’s presidency as it was in the last year under then-President Donald Trump, with more Democrats and fewer Republicans now saying they trust the government, according to the Pew Research Center. But trust has edged up slightly, by 7 percentage points, from 2019.
Biden said that part of the reason he ran for president was to ""restore faith in government"" and that government trust ""is coming up some"" after an ""incredibly low ebb.""
Biden didn’t specify over what period trust in government began to rise, but if he meant that it has risen since he took office, polls from the Pew Research Center don’t back that up.
Biden, July 21: One of the things I said when I ran for office, it is not Democrat/Republican here — it is, we’ve got to restore faith in government. We have got to get people to the point where they trust government. And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I’d tell you and I’ve made mistakes. And when I think I got it right, I’ll say it, but I’ll take responsibility for what I do and say.
Part of it is, generally raising confidence in elected officials, raising confidence. … You know, the criticism I got by saying, I want to unite the country. They said, he can’t unite the country. If we can’t unite the country, we can never get some of these problems solved, and that goes to trust. Why can’t you unite the country? Why isn’t there a willingness to trust? Government trust is really — was at an incredibly low ebb, it is coming up some.
According to a Pew Research Center poll on April 11, 24% of Americans said they trust the federal government to do what is right ""just about always"" or ""most of the time."" That was also the moving average at that time as well.
Although a Pew poll on Aug. 2, 2020, found public trust in the government was 20%, the moving average was at the same 24% figure (a poll on April 12, 2020, put the figure at 27%).
That moving average of 24% is historically low, but it is trending up slightly from 17% in March 2019. The lowest moving average, 15%, came in October 2011 under then-President Barack Obama.
Pew has been keeping ""trust in government"" data since 1958. Back then, nearly three-quarters of Americans (73%) said they trusted the federal government to do the right thing almost always or most of the time. The trust percentage has risen and fallen in the decades since, but has been stubbornly low for more than a decade.
Pew, May 17: Trust in government began eroding during the 1960s, amid the escalation of the Vietnam War, and the decline continued in the 1970s with the Watergate scandal and worsening economic struggles. Confidence in government recovered in the mid-1980s before falling again in the mid-1990s. But as the economy grew in the late 1990s so too did confidence in government. Public trust reached a three-decade high shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but declined quickly thereafter. Since 2007, the share saying they can trust the government always or most of the time has not surpassed 30%.
Whether one has trust in the government, of course, is affected by whether the president is of the same political party. In April, 36% of Democrats (or those who ""lean"" Democrat) said they trusted the government, as opposed to 9% of Republicans. The roles were reversed under Trump. In August 2020, 12% of Democrats and 28% of Republicans said they trusted the government.
Black Americans’ trust in government has risen sharply with Biden in office (37% compared with 15% last year), though trust has remained the same (18%) among white Americans.

      FactChecking Biden’s Vaccination Goal

		President Joe Biden this week boasted on Twitter about his promise to administer 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, ""With the progress we’re making I believe we’ll not only reach that, we’ll break it."" But as some critics have noted, it was a pretty low bar to begin with.
On the day Biden was inaugurated, the U.S. administered nearly 1.5 million shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID Data Tracker. On that day, the seven-day average for the previous week was about 966,000 shots a day. In other words, the U.S. was already virtually at the pace Biden set as his goal before he took any action as president.
By Biden’s second day in office, the seven-day average was at the 1 million doses per day average needed to meet his 100-day goal.


The goal seemed more ambitious when Biden first announced his ""100 million shots in the first 100 day"" goal in a Dec. 8 speech in Wilmington, Delaware, as president-elect. At that point, vaccinations hadn’t even begun yet.
A New York Times story that day called it an ""ambitious"" goal and said ""fulfilling it will require no hiccups in manufacturing or distributing the vaccine and a willingness by Americans to be vaccinated."" The reporters said the experts they spoke to found Biden’s timeline to be ""achievable"" but ""optimistic.""
It still seemed like an ""incredible goal,"" as Biden put it, when he talked about the promise on Dec. 29, less than two weeks after the first vaccine doses were administered.
""It would take ramping up five to six times the current pace to 1 million shots a day, but even with that improvement, even if we boost the speed of vaccinations to 1 million shots a day, it will still take months to have a majority of the United States population vaccinated,"" Biden said.
The day before he made that speech, Dec. 28, two weeks into distribution, the U.S. had administered a total of 3.5 million doses of vaccine. So measuring from Day One, the daily average was about 250,000 — and it would take four times that rate to get to Biden’s goal of 1 million a day.
But even then, Biden was misleadingly ignoring the upward trend. On Dec. 29, the day of Biden’s speech, the CDC reported that 686,411 vaccines were administered — or roughly two-thirds of what would be needed to meet Biden’s daily goal. The seven-day average that day was 317,766.

To be sure, the vaccine rollout was slower than expected at the beginning. Although then-President Donald Trump had promised to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020, the total at year’s end was just 5.4 million.
But the number of doses administered continued to trend upward during the final weeks of the Trump presidency. On Jan. 7, a little more than a million doses were administered, and the seven-day average was up to 542,000, according to the CDC. By Jan. 14, the seven-day average was up to 918,000 doses per day.
Despite the upward trend, an article in USA Today on Jan. 14 continued to call Biden’s 100-shots-in-100-days promise ""a lofty goal to reverse a slow start to the nation’s vaccine rollout.""
That same day, Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, called Biden’s goal ""aspirational … but doable’’ and warned that the ""first days of that 100 days may be substantially slower than it will be towards the end.""
""It’s not going to occur quickly … you’re going to see the ramp-up occurring only when the resources really begin to flow,"" Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told STAT news.
But by that time, the average number of daily doses was already nearing the 1 million shots a day threshold needed to meet Biden’s promise. And by Jan. 20, the day of Biden’s inauguration — a day that saw nearly 1.5 million vaccines administered — the seven-day average was about 966,000.
The following day, Jan. 21, another roughly 1.5 million doses were administered, bringing the seven-day average to over 1 million per day. After Biden gave a speech on the COVID-19 response, a reporter asked if — given the pace of vaccination he inherited — Biden shouldn’t have set his bar higher.
""When I announced it, you all said, ‘It’s not possible.’ Come on, give me a break man,"" Biden responded.
At a press briefing later that day, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was also asked why Biden wasn’t ""shooting just a little bit higher.""
""Well, none of us are mathematicians, myself included, so I asked our team to do a little math on this,"" Psaki responded. ""So, the Trump administration was given 36 million doses when they were in office for 38 days. They administered a total of about 17 million shots.  That’s about less than 500,000 shots a day. What we’re proposing is to double that to about 1 million shots per day. And we have outlined this goal and objective in coordination and consultation with our health and medical experts. So it is ambitious. It’s something that we feel is bold and was called that certainly at the time, and we’re working overtime to help to achieve it — try to achieve it.""
Psaki’s math is roughly accurate, but again, it misleadingly ignores the trend line, and the fact that the U.S. had virtually reached the 1 million doses per day average in the week before Biden took office.
Indeed, many experts were underwhelmed by Biden’s goal.
""I think we probably need to be a bit more audacious in these goals,"" CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said on air shortly after Biden bristled at the reporter who asked if the goal shouldn’t be higher.
Gupta praised the Biden administration’s vaccination plans, particularly for expanding the role of the federal government in helping states to administer the vaccinations.
But given the number of vaccinations occurring by the time Biden took office, Gupta said the administration may be ""under promising and with the hope of over delivering.""
In remarks on Jan. 25, Biden seemed to acknowledge the low bar, suggesting the U.S. might beat his goal by 50%.
""I think, with the grace of God, and the goodwill of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to … 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,"" Biden said.
But by the following day, he had retreated back to his original ""ambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days."" He added that was ""not the endpoint; it’s just the start.""
By Feb. 9, the seven-day average had already moved beyond 1.5 million doses per day. According to an NBC News tracker of Biden’s vaccination goal, the U.S. is on pace to reach 150 million doses in Biden’s first 100 days, which ends April 29.
In a press briefing on Feb. 17, a reporter asked Psaki about Vice President Kamala Harris’ comment in an interview that aired Feb. 14, ""In many ways, we [the Biden administration] are starting from scratch on something that’s been raging for almost an entire year."" Was that appropriate, the reporter asked, given that the U.S. was administering nearly a million shots a day in the week before Biden took office?
""When the president came in and the vice president came in, there were not enough vaccines, there were not enough vaccinators, there were not enough vaccination locations,"" Psaki said. ""They’ve taken significant steps to address all of those issues. Yes, in the week prior to the president taking office, there were about 800- to 900,000, as you said, doses doing — being given a day. The average was about 400- to 500,000 prior to that. Last week, the average was 1.7 million a day. So there are significant steps that have been taken.""
The Biden administration is free to boast about its efforts to ramp up vaccinations, which experts have also praised. But Biden and Psaki are spinning the facts. Although the initial rollout was slow under Trump and many first viewed Biden’s goal as ambitious, vaccinations steadily increased each week, nearly reaching 1 million doses a day when Biden took office.
At the current rate, there’s no reason to think the U.S. won’t ""break"" Biden’s goal of 100 million shots in 100 days, as he boasted on Twitter.

		Defending his early response to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that in late February, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was saying, ""This is no problem. This is going to blow over.""
In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci said that ""right now at this moment"" the risk was ""low"" and there was ""no need"" for people ""to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis."" But he added that ""this could change,"" that people needed to be wary of ""community spread,"" and that it could develop into a ""major outbreak.""
Trump’s comment came in response to a question about press reports that he ignored warnings about the growing threat of the coronavirus in more than a dozen classified intelligence briefings included in the President’s Daily Brief in January and February.
Reporter, April 28: Mr. President, can you clarify what your intelligence advisers were telling you back in January and February? Were you warned about what was happening with coronavirus and the threat to this country? Should there have been stronger warnings? What were you hearing every day?
Trump: Yeah, yeah. Well, I think probably a lot more to the Democrats, because a month later, Nancy Pelosi was saying, ""Let’s dance in the streets of Chinatown."" You go back and you take a look at — even professionals, like Anthony [Fauci], were saying this is no problem. This is late in February: ""This is no problem. This is going to blow — this is going to blow over."" And they’re professionals, and they’re good professionals.
Most people thought this was going to blow over. And if you can go — we did, I think, on January — toward the end of January, we did a ban with China. That was a very — I think you just said, a little while ago, that was a very important step. And then ultimately, we did a ban on Europe. That was very early in the process.
Because if you take the ban and you look at it, I was badly criticized by Sleepy Joe Biden, by others. I was criticized horribly for — I mean, he called — he said all sorts of things. We won’t even say it. And then he apologized because — two weeks ago, he put out a statement that I was right. We did a ban. … And many people — Democrats, professionals, probably Republicans — said that this would never happen, there’d be nothing; no big problem. You saw that, I think, better than anybody, Deborah. This was after the ban. So, obviously, I took it very serious. I’m not going be banning China from coming in if I didn’t take it seriously. And I did that early.
There are several misleading statements in this response:

As we have written, House Speaker Pelosi did not say, ""Let’s dance in the streets of Chinatown."" During her visit on Feb. 24 — three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions — she told people it was safe to eat and shop in Chinatown at a time when tourism was suffering because of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year. 
Trump did not ""ban"" travel from China. There were exceptions, including for Americans and their family members, and for cargo shipments between the countries.
Biden did not ""apologize"" for criticizing the China travel restrictions. His campaign on April 3 said Biden supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China, and argued that Biden’s comments about ""Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia"" — made the same day as Trump announced the travel restrictions — were not a reference to those restrictions.

But here we’ll focus on Trump’s claim that in late February, ""even professionals, like Anthony [Fauci], were saying this is no problem"" and ""this is going to blow over."" That’s not what Fauci was saying at that time.
This isn’t the first time Trump has misleadingly cited Fauci’s late February assessments of the virus.
On April 12, Trump retweeted a post by DeAnna Lorraine — a recently defeated California Republican congressional candidate — in which Lorraine claimed that ""Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large."" She ended her post, ""Time to #FireFauci…""

Sorry Fake News, it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN https://t.co/d40JQkUZg5
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2020

In a Feb. 29 interview with Kristen Welker and Peter Alexander on NBC’s ""Today"" show, Fauci said the risk from COVID-19 ""is still low,"" and he said there was no need for people to change their daily routines ""at this moment."" But he warned that could change if ""you start to see community spread.""
Alexander, Feb. 29: So, Dr. Fauci, it’s Saturday morning in America. People are waking up right now with real concerns about this. They want to go to malls and movies, maybe the gym as well. Should we be changing our habits and, if so, how?
Fauci: No. Right now, at this moment, there’s no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times even on this program. You’ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don’t need to change anything you’re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.
Welker: Dr. Fauci, quickly, how does this all end?
Fauci: You know, it ends if you — it depends on the nature of the outbreak. I mean, this could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled. At the end of the day, this will ultimately go down. Hopefully we could protect the American public from any serious degree of morbidity or mortality. That’s the reason why we’ve got to do the things that we have in our plan.
Fauci’s comments came as concerns were just starting to emerge in the U.S. about ""community spread,"" meaning that the ""source of infection is unknown,"" as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, and the virus may have been transmitted person-to-person from someone in the U.S., rather than by exposure to an infected traveler who had brought it to the U.S.
On Feb. 26, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a telebriefing that the CDC fully anticipated seeing community spread of the virus within U.S. borders.
""It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore,"" she said, ""but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.""
On Feb. 28, Messonnier reported that there were three confirmed cases of person-to-person spread in the United States. She said that while ""the immediate risk to the general American public remains low … [o]ur guidelines and advice are likely to be interim and subject to change as we learn more.""
At a press conference on Feb. 29, the afternoon after his ""Today"" show interview, Fauci reiterated that the country as a whole, at that time, ""still remains at low risk. But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation.""
Fauci, Feb. 29: But as we say this, we need to prepare for further challenges. And we will have them. You will hear about additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread.
So when you have cases throughout the world, the way we’re seeing now — South Korea, Italy, Iran and places like that — the United States cannot be completely immune to that. The challenge is how we deal with it.
It wasn’t until two weeks later, on March 16, that Trump imposed social distancing guidelines.
One could question whether Fauci was slow to publicly call on the federal government to enact those guidelines. But Fauci’s comments in late February were far different from Trump’s claim that Fauci said, ""This is no problem. This is going to blow over.""

		In this video, we show how President Donald Trump misquoted Dr. Anthony Fauci’s remarks in late February about the threat that the novel coronavirus posed for Americans.

At the White House on April 28, Trump — in defense of his early response to the coronavirus pandemic — falsely claimed that in late February, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had said, ""This is no problem. This is going to blow over.""
In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci was asked if Americans should ""be changing our habits."" He responded by describing the risk ""right now at this moment"" as ""low,"" so there was ""no need"" for people ""to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis."" But he added that ""this could change,"" that people needed to be wary of ""community spread,"" and that it could develop into a ""major outbreak.""
Trump repeated this false claim in a Fox News virtual town hall on May 3. ""Everybody, even Tony Fauci was saying, ‘It’s going to pass, not gonna be a big deal,'"" Trump said at the town hall.
As of the morning of May 4, the U.S. had more than 1.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 67,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.

      Trump Falsely Claims COVID-19 Death Projection Assumes ‘No Mitigation’

		Dismissing concerns that states are reopening too soon, President Donald Trump incorrectly said that a newly revised model projecting 134,000 COVID-19 deaths by August ""assumes no mitigation."" In fact, the model assumes states will keep their existing social distancing measures in place, unless suspensions have already been announced.
Trump’s error came when he was asked about a model from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The group’s modeling efforts previously figured prominently in presentations from the White House’s coronavirus task force, and until a few days ago, had been projecting around 72,000 deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus by August. According to Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracker, there were already more than 70,000 deaths as of May 5.
Reporter, May 5: Mr. President, on the IHME model, which is now showing 134,000 deaths by August, doubling its previous prediction, are you concerned that that’s happening because some of these states are relaxing guidelines too early?
Trump: No. No, I’m not, because that — that assumes no mitigation.
Reporter: Assumes less?
Trump: And we’re going to have mitigation. No, we’re letting people out. But the fact that we’re letting people go and go to their jobs — they have to do it.
When asked later if he believed the death toll numbers, Trump again suggested that the higher estimate from the model was because it didn’t incorporate any mitigation efforts.
""Well, that’s with no mitigation. We’re doing mitigation. We have a lot of mitigation,"" he said. ""The fact that they’re out — they’re mitigating. They’re social distancing. They all know that. They’re washing their hands a lot. But we have to get our country open. We have to open our country.""
The president then proceeded to draw attention to a different death estimate, made by Imperial College London early on in the pandemic, that unlike the IHME model, was done assuming no mitigation.
""I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,"" Trump said. ""But, you know, one model that’s very important is that if we did this a different way, we would have lost more — much more than 2 million people. And we did it the right way. We did everything right. But now it’s time to go back to work.""
In a March 16 report, researchers with Imperial College London projected as many as 2.2 million deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus in ""the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour.""
It’s fair for Trump to note that some models haven’t performed well, and to be skeptical of them in general. 
Many experts have been especially critical of IHME’s methods, as they essentially take previously reported COVID-19 death data from around the world and try to extrapolate those patterns and apply them to other outbreaks, without accounting for differences in how those outbreaks are being handled. That’s in contrast to epidemiological modeling, which actually tries to use what’s known about the virus and how it spreads to model disease transmission in a population.
But Trump is wrong to say IHME’s model doesn’t include any mitigation. As Amelia Apfel, a media relations officer for IHME, told us, ""[O]ur model has always assumed mitigation.""
The new IHME model, which was released on May 4 and now includes some elements of disease transmission modeling, incorporates a variety of government-mandated social distancing policies.
This is most obvious when viewing IHME’s projections for individual states. The top of each page shows which policies the model is assuming are in effect.
""As of May 4, our forecasts now account for locations that have lifted social distancing measures and assumes those measures will remain lifted through August 4,"" the website says. ""For locations that have not lifted social distancing, the model assumes measures will stay in place through August 4.""
The state of New York, for example, has not suspended any of its mandates, so the model’s projections are based on the idea that schools and businesses remain shuttered, and gathering restrictions and stay-at-home orders are in place. In Colorado, some social distancing measures still apply, but the model is factoring in that the stay-at-home order was lifted and some businesses were allowed to reopen.
IHME’s website further explains that it only classifies measures as being in place if they pertain to the entire population within a given state. So, if a city had ordered schools to be closed, but that order didn’t pertain statewide, the measure wouldn’t be part of the model.
Apfel said that the team incorporated information about states’ social distancing policies, including any that had ended or were scheduled to end, as of May 3. ""[A]s we update going forward,"" she said, ""we’ll be rolling in changes to state social distancing policies that we’re able to verify.""
The model, then, reflects some relaxation of policies as states begin to reopen, but is still trying to capture the mitigation efforts that remain. This is one of the key reasons why the IHME numbers increased — to 134,475, with a range between 95,092 and 242,890 — relative to its earlier estimates.
""The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,"" explains a press release for the new model.
It remains to be seen whether the new IHME estimate is anywhere close to being accurate, but the president was incorrect to say the model ""assumes no mitigation.""

      FactChecking Trump’s Weekend Claims

		On Sept. 26 and 27, President Donald Trump spoke for about two hours and 15 minutes in five appearances — including one campaign rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania. We’ve compiled many of the president’s false and misleading claims from those remarks.
By contrast, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spoke for less than 45 minutes in a few appearances. We wrote about Biden’s claims in ""FactChecking Biden’s SCOTUS Speech and Repeats.""
We examined the two candidates’ weekend remarks in the run-up to the first presidential debate on Sept. 29.
On Saturday, Sept. 26, Trump made remarks in announcing Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee for the Supreme Court, before departing the White House on Marine One and at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. On Sunday, Sept. 27, the president did an interview with Fox News and held a press confererence.
We’ve written about most of these claims before.
Distorting the Facts on Biden’s Positions
Biden’s health plan. Trump inaccurately suggested Biden supported a Medicare for All health plan. Biden has been clear in his opposition to the idea, pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, as the Democratic debates showed.
""The Biden plan would … destroy protections for preexisting conditions. You know that. They want to go socialized medicine,"" Trump said. ""Get rid of 180 million private plans that people love.""
Biden’s health plan calls for keeping and building on the Affordable Care Act, creating ""a public health insurance option like Medicare"" that people could choose to buy, expanding the tax credits under the ACA and offering a premium-free plan for those in non-Medicaid-expansion states who otherwise would have qualified for the program under the ACA.
Killing Osama bin Laden. Trump misleadingly claimed Biden ""opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden."" As we have written, Biden said only that he wanted further confirmation that bin Laden was actually present at the compound in Pakistan.
School choice/charter schools. Trump wrongly claimed that Biden ""wants to ban school choice and ban charter schools."" 
As we have written, Biden opposes federal funding going to ""for-profit charter schools,"" but schools managed by for-profit companies make up only a fraction of charter schools — about 10%, according to a researcher for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition — the ultimate in school choice for some — he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools.
Biden and guns. Trump said, ""Biden wants to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in schools, right?"" As we have written, it is not true that Biden favors confiscating weapons, and there is no evidence Biden wants to indoctrinate children with ""poisonous anti-American lies.""
After Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke — a proponent of mandatory buybacks of assault weapons — endorsed Biden in March, misinformation about Biden’s position on guns began to circulate. Videos and articles suggested Biden would be confiscating weapons should he make it to the White House. But that was unfounded, as we have written. While Biden did say O’Rourke would help him with gun policy, he never adopted the mandatory buyback approach.
Biden’s gun safety proposals include banning the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and a voluntary program to buy back assault weapons and high-capacity magazines from those who now possess them. Under Biden’s plan, assault weapons owners could either sell the weapons to the government or register them under the National Firearms Act.
Fracking. In Pennsylvania, the nation’s second-largest natural gas producer, Trump claimed that ""Joe Biden has vowed to ban fracking,"" which Biden recently said emphatically he would not do. In the past, Biden has incorrectly explained his climate change plan, which calls for only ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" 
In a July 2019 Democratic primary debate, for example, Biden said, ""we would make sure it’s eliminated,"" when he was asked if there would be a place for ""fossil fuels, including coal and fracking"" in a Biden administration. But Biden’s campaign later clarified that he meant that he supports ending federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, and transitioning, by 2050, to a clean energy economy with net-zero emissions. 
His plan allows for existing fracking permits to continue on federal lands and does nothing to prohibit fracking in non-federal areas — where most crude oil and natural gas is produced.
""I am not banning fracking,"" Biden said last month, at an Aug. 31 campaign rally in Pittsburgh. ""Let me say that again. I am not banning fracking — no matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me.""
Health care access. Trump falsely claimed, ""Biden is pledging to give federal health care to illegal aliens, which is decimating Medicare."" Biden has made no such promise. 
Biden has said that, unlike current law, his plan would allow those individuals living in the U.S. illegally to ""buy into the system,"" referring to the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges. 
A unity task force made up of supporters of Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also ""recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, [and] allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces.""
Refugees. Trump repeated his criticism of Biden for proposing to ""increase refugee admission 700%."" That is close to correct — largely because Trump, in a break from past administrations, sharply lowered the cap on refugees to just 18,000 in fiscal year 2020, which began on Oct. 1, 2019. 
Biden says on his campaign website that he will ""set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000,"" which is a 600% increase from 18,000. It is also 56% higher than President George W. Bush’s last fiscal year, and 14% higher than what President Barack Obama had authorized in his final fiscal year.
Election Ballots, Polls and Interference
Ballots found in ""river."" As part of his campaign against mail-in ballots, Trump misleadingly claimed ""many ballots"" were found ""in a riverbed.""
According to the Outagamie County Sheriff’s Office in Wisconsin, three trays of mail were found Sept. 21 along the side of a road and in a ditch next to a highway in Greenville. Officials there said the batch of mail included ""several"" absentee ballots, though a Postal Service spokesman would not comment on whether those were completed ballots, or blank ones being sent to voters, according to the Post Crescent. The paper quoted the county clerking saying election officials started to mail out ballots to voters on Sept. 17.
Double ballots. Trump also wrongly said before departing the White House on Sept. 26 that there was ""another case where a thousand ballots were sent, but not single — they were sent double, so you get to vote twice."" He said that ""thousands of ballots sent to people and they’re double ballots, where you get two votes.""
As NBC4 in Washington reported, election officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, believe up to 1,000 people who requested mail-in ballots may have gotten two by mistake. But those people won’t be able to vote twice. Fairfax County Registrar Gary Scott said that when every ballot is returned, ""we make an entry into their voter record that they have returned a ballot. So if something else shows up, the ballot has already been returned. We can’t count that ballot.""
General election polls. Prior to leaving for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the president said, ""We’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Florida. I think we’re leading everywhere."" He is trailing by nearly five points in Pennsylvania, according to polling averages by Real Clear Politics and Five Thirty Eight. It is a virtual tie in Florida, with Biden holding a slight advantage in the averages computed by both websites. It’s safe to say both states are very much in play for either candidate.
On soliciting Russian interference. Trump said that he was only joking when he said, ""Russia, if you’re listening, find her [Hillary Clinton’s] emails."" According to Trump, when he delivered the line, ""we all laughed together"" and ""the whole place cracks up along with me."" He blamed the media for creating the controversy, saying they ""cut off my last word.""
We’ll let readers decide for themselves Trump’s intent, but Trump did not laugh when he delivered the line at a press conference at his resort in Doral, Florida, in July 2016, nor did the assembled media. Watch for yourself.
On or about that same day, Russian military intelligence officers attempted ""to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton’s personal office,"" according to the July 13, 2018, indictment filed against 12 Russian military intelligence officers for waging cyberattacks on the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. 
COVID-19
Fatality rate decline. Repeating a line he’s now delivered more than a dozen times, Trump said at his Pennsylvania rally, ""We pioneered life saving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April."" 
As we’ve written, he’s right that the U.S.’s reported case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths from the coronavirus among diagnosed cases, has fallen dramatically since April. But Trump’s suggestion that that’s entirely due to treatment improvements — and advances Americans or the American government developed — is misleading.
To date, only one drug — the steroid dexamethasone — has demonstrated a mortality benefit for COVID-19 patients. That finding came from a randomized controlled trial conducted in the U.K. 
Because the case fatality rate is highly dependent on the number of identified cases, experts say part, if not most, of the decline can be explained by increased testing, along with a shift in the types of people who are infected with the coronavirus. In the pandemic’s early months, testing was often limited to people with symptoms and older, higher-risk patients made up more of the cases. Over the summer, testing became more widely available and diagnoses became more common in younger people.
Excess mortality. The president said that ""Europe has had almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States,"" echoing earlier claims about excess mortality, but using an even higher percentage. Available data show that it’s the U.S., not Europe, that has a higher excess mortality rate. Excess mortality is an alternative metric that avoids issues of miscounting or underreporting COVID-19 deaths, and instead uses the actual number of deaths, regardless of cause, relative to a ""normal"" or expected number of deaths during a given time period.
Our previous analyses, which have used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and EuroMOMO, a group monitoring mortality trends in Europe, along with the Human Mortality Database, have not borne out any of Trump’s past percentages.
Updated figures from these sources again fail to back Trump’s revised claim. The CDC’s latest estimate, which covers deaths between Feb. 1 and Sept. 12, ranges from 208,390 to 274,055 excess deaths, with a middle estimate of 241,222 excess deaths. That’s versus 211,025 excess deaths through week 38, or Sept. 20, for 24 European countries or parts of countries, according to EuroMOMO. When adjusted for population, the U.S. has had 730 excess deaths per million people, which is 6% more than the EuroMOMO region’s 686 excess deaths per million.
The Human Mortality Database figures, which include more of Europe, show that up until June 28 (the most recent data for the largest number of countries), Europe’s excess mortality is 9.9% above normal, versus 13.8% for the U.S. And when limited to countries that have data through week 35, or Aug. 30 — the latest date for the U.S. — America’s excess mortality rate is also higher: 14.5% compared with 12.5% for that subset of Europe.
Strategic National Stockpile ""cupboards"" weren’t ""bare."" As he has before, Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration left the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies ""bare."" ""We did a job, including ventilators that nobody had,"" the president said during the Pennsylvania rally. ""The cupboards were bare when we took over."" 
While some news reports note that some personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirator masks, were not replenished after 2009’s H1N1 influenza pandemic, the stockpile was not empty. In 2016, a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said there were at least six warehouses of items worth approximately $7 billion. The president’s boast about ventilators also rings hollow. As we’ve written, Trump actually inherited more ventilators in the stockpile — nearly 17,000 — than were distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Saving lives. At his rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Trump said of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, ""We had to close it down. We saved millions of lives."" As we have written, we don’t know for sure whether Trump is on target when he says that the lockdowns — which were imposed by many states, not by Trump — may have saved ""millions"" of lives. Also, Trump at times pressured states to open up before their governors wanted to.
An early model from Imperial College London projected in March that the U.S. could lose 2.2 million people to the pandemic, but only if no mitigation measures whatsoever were taken to combat the virus.
An unpublished study released in June by a group of economists estimated ""mitigating public health measures"" would save between 913,762 and 2,046,322 lives in the U.S. At the same time, they estimated that ""the economic downturn from shelter-in-place measures and other restrictions on economic activity could create an indirect collateral loss of 84,000 to 514,800 lives over the following years.""
A study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley published on June 8 in the journal Nature found that lockdowns had prevented 60 million infections in the United States. The study didn’t say how many lives were saved, but the lead researcher, Solomon Hsiang, did say the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect ""infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.""
A study by researchers at the Imperial College London estimated lockdowns saved about 3.1 million lives in 11 European countries. Columbia University researchers concluded that 36,000 fewer deaths from the coronavirus would have occurred if the U.S. had imposed social distancing one week earlier in March.
Popular Talking Points
Not the ""greatest economy."" As he frequently does, Trump falsely said at the rally that the United States had had ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before the novel coronavirus hit. As we have written, that was not the case. The real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product grew 2.2% in 2019  — down from 3% in 2018. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 3% a total of 17 times.
Trump also said, ""We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months."" He failed to mention that is fewer than half of the 22.2 million jobs the country had lost earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Auto plants. Trump repeated false claims about auto plants in Michigan, telling the rally crowd in Pennsylvania: ""What I’ve done for Michigan, in particular, also Pennsylvania, but what I’ve done for them with autos, forget it. They’re building 17, or expanding 17, different plants. They hadn’t built one in 42 years and we’re building a lot of them.""
The last vehicle assembly plant built in Michigan before Trump took office was a General Motors plant in Lansing Delta Township, completed in 2006. As for the country at large, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz both announced new plants in 2015 in South Carolina.
Despite Trump’s boasts, the number of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs in Michigan has gone down under Trump, even before the coronavirus pandemic caused economic shutdowns. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced in February 2019 it would convert two plants into a new assembly site in Michigan, and Honda and General Motors announced shortly after his inauguration a joint venture to produce hydrogen fuel cell systems in an existing GM facility. But there have been three plant closures announced in the state since Trump took office.
Oil and natural gas. Trump took credit for milestones reached long before his presidency when he claimed: ""We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world."" The U.S. became the leader in production of petroleum in 2013 and natural gas in 2009, as we’ve written before.
Nobel Peace Prize. At the rally, Trump complained that the media had ignored his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump said: ""I got nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes. … And I said, ‘They didn’t cover two Nobel prizes.’ I got two in one week. … But the fake news never even put it on. And somebody had a show where they said the amount of time devoted to Donald Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize, two of them, zero on the network, zero.""
As we have written, Trump makes a number of false statements when he discusses his nomination. Trump conflates being nominated, as he was, with actually winning, as his predecessor, Barack Obama, did. Trump hasn’t won one. Simply being nominated is not a huge deal: This year 211 individuals and 107 organizations have been nominated. And he wasn’t nominated for two: While he was nominated by two people, there is just one Nobel Peace Prize. 
Border wall and open borders. As he often does, Trump talked about the progress his administration has made on building his long-promised wall on the border between the United States and Mexico, a major Trump campaign promise during 2016. ""And we are just finishing a beautiful wall,"" he said. ""That wall 340 miles, 340.  … Now we’re up to 330 miles."" According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 341 miles of wall and fencing have been erected. But as we have reported, most of that is replacement of existing fencing or wall; there has been little new construction. The San Antonio Express-News reported on Aug. 7 that only five miles of new wall have been built.
Trump also said, ""By contrast, Joe Biden supports open borders."" As we have reported, that is not the case. There’s no doubt Biden supports a more open and welcoming immigration policy than the one championed by Trump. But that’s not the same as advocating open borders. ""I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry — that’s where all the bad stuff is happening,"" Biden said in an interview on Aug. 5.
Quelling urban unrest. Trump falsely took credit for sending the National Guard into Minneapolis to put down violent protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. ""You saw what we did in Minneapolis,"" he said. ""She called us like a week and a half too late. We went in. How long did that take? About a half hour. It was over. We brought in the National Guard. We told Seattle we’re coming in and they left that night.""
Trump is wrong about the National Guard in both cases. In Minneapolis, as we have written, after a second day of demonstrations got out of hand, Mayor Jacob Frey officially declared a local emergency and called for the state’s National Guard to be deployed. Minnesota’s governor Tim Walz signed an executive order activating the state’s National Guard following day. Similarly, in Seattle, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee activated the guard at the request of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan after protests turned violent.
Low–income housing in the suburbs. Trump said that he had ""knocked out"" an Obama-era regulation regarding low-income housing in the suburbs. ""I knocked out the regulation that allows low-income housing in the suburbs,"" he said. ""They’re changing the zoning so they can build. That’s what it is. They’re changing the zoning. It was a rule, a regulation that was a disaster."" As we have written, on other occasions Trump has said the regulation ""required"" building low-income housing in suburbia.
As we said in our story, it’s unclear whether the rule had any impact at all, as Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson suspended its requirements in 2018. Experts on regulatory processes and community development told us HUD’s 2015 final rule on ""Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing"" did not mandate either low-income housing or rezoning. In its published rule, HUD said of the regulation: ""This rule does not impose any land use decisions or zoning laws on any local government.""
Islamic State. Trump again took too much credit for recapturing Islamic State-held land. ""In just three and a half years, we’ve … obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate,"" he said. Before Trump took office, about half of the territory held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had been regained under his predecessor, Barack Obama. That’s according to figures provided by Trump’s own administration.
The rest of the land was retaken under Trump. In March 2019, the Syrian Democratic Forces announced that the final stronghold in eastern Syria had been retaken.
Obama’s unfilled judicial vacancies. Trump again wrongly claimed that President Barack Obama left the Trump administration ""over 100″ federal judicial court vacancies — it was precisely 112 — ""because he probably thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win. And, you know, in which case it wouldn’t have mattered too much. I guess that’s what he assumed.""
As we have written, the number of judicial vacancies left by Obama was historically high, but that wasn’t because Obama didn’t try to fill most of them. Rather, it was resistance to Obama’s judicial nominations from Senate Republicans who took over a majority during the last two years of Obama’s presidency. In early January 2017, just before Trump took office, there were 59 federal court nominees pending.
Ukraine
Ukraine prosecutor. At his rally and in a White House briefing, Trump repeated the false narrative about ""Joe’s involvement"" in the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor in 2015. Trump falsely accused the former vice president of withholding $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine ""until such time as they let go of a prosecutor that was investigating the company that his son was involved with,"" referring to Hunter Biden’s work as a board member for the Ukraine gas company Burisma. 
As we have written, the Obama administration joined the international community and anti-corruption advocates in Ukraine in calling for the prosecutor to be removed from office for his failure to aggressively prosecute corruption. A Republican-led Senate committee investigation recently found no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president.
Schiff and Trump’s Ukraine phone call. Trump criticized Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, for giving his own dramatic crime-novel representation of what happened in the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""Shifty Schiff, he gets up and says a totally different thing than what I said, totally different. They say, ‘Sir, you can’t go after him because he’s shielded because he made this speech.’ He totally lied,"" Trump said. 
A day after the White House released a memo of the July phone call, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and Biden’s son, Hunter, Schiff gave his own rendition at the start of a congressional hearing, saying this was ""the essence of what the president communicates"" in his call ""in not so many words."" Later in the hearing, Schiff said the summary ""was meant to be at least part in parody.""
So, it’s true Schiff admittedly gave an account that was different than the memo — and in some respects inaccurate, as we’ve said. But it wasn’t ""totally different"": Other parts of Schiff’s comments were similar to the memo of the phone call.

		Quick Take
Viral posts on Facebook falsely claim the government has approved a second round of coronavirus stimulus payments to everyone who signs up — and that the money will be forthcoming in ""5-7 business days."" Congress is considering another economic package, but a new round of support has not been passed.
Full Story
A government stimulus package — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — was approved in March to help an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The $2 trillion CARES Act most notably provided financial support in the form of $1,200 checks to qualifying individuals and dedicated $376 billion for small business relief.
High unemployment rates and the July 31 expiration of the $600-per-week unemployment payments authorized by the CARES Act have prompted Congress to consider another stimulus package.
On May 15, the House passed a $3 trillion Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES Act, which would distribute another round of federal stimulus checks of up to $1,200 to individuals and, among other measures, would expand the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses.
However, members of the Senate, who returned from recess on July 20, have indicated they will not pass the HEROES Act. Instead, they plan to propose their own stimulus package in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Senate hopes to keep the cost in the $1 trillion range, which will limit the scope of the bill.
But before Congress has agreed on the elements of another economic support package, a new iteration of an old prank post is circulating on Facebook, falsely suggesting that a second round of federal stimulus payments is imminent.
The new post reads, ""Everyone including essential workers will be compensated $1,000. The money will be available to u in 5-7 business days. Thank me later. Click the link to sign up.""
 When the link provided is clicked, up pops an image of a gorilla making an obscene gesture. 
Versions of the post use the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA – neither of which would be responsible for a second stimulus payment, we should note.
Another version of the bogus post show images of a check from the Treasury and the U.S. Capitol, and claims: ""And it passed[.] WE GET ANOTHER STIMULUS CHECK FOR $2000 on August 10, 2020[.] Everyone including ESSENTIAL WORKERS will be compensated $2000[.] The money will be available to you in 5-7 business days.""
But the amount of any additional stimulus checks, who would be eligible, and when any payments would be made have not been determined.

		Quick Take
A viral image on Facebook falsely suggests a vaccine exists for the novel coronavirus by referencing a photo of a vaccine for a coronavirus that infects dogs. The two viruses are not the same.


Full Story 
Facebook users are spreading a photo of a vaccine for canine coronavirus to wrongly suggest that a vaccine exists for the novel coronavirus now infecting humans around the world.
""Now this was 2001 tell me why 19 years later they say there is no vaccine,"" text in the viral image reads.
The image was shared in various corners of Facebook, including in a group dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy theory. One user’s popular post claimed that a ""CORONA VIRUS VACCINE EXIST SINCE 2001″ and ""WE ARE BEING PLAYED BY THOSE ON THE TOP.""

But the vaccine label in the photo clearly states ""Canine Coronavirus Vaccine.""
Like other instances of misinformation that have appeared since the outbreak began, the posts advance a false claim that centers on the term ""coronavirus."" The term refers to a family of viruses, but they’re not all the same.
The novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 — which causes COVID-19 — was first reported in China in late 2019.
The product in the viral photo is Nobivac 1-Cv, a vaccine sold by a subsidiary of Merck & Co. It protects dogs from the canine coronavirus, or CCV, a virus that typically causes a mild gastroenteritis, or inflammation in the intestines, in infected dogs. It was first identified in 1971.
As we wrote when debunking similar posts dealing with a vaccine for cows, experts say it is not safe for humans to attempt to vaccinate themselves with animal vaccines.

		SciCheck Digest
A chemical widely used to sterilize medical devices is also used for nasal swabs in COVID-19 testing. But a viral video misleadingly suggests that the swabs are dangerous — saying that the chemical causes cancer and can alter DNA. Experts say the chemical’s use in this context does not pose a threat to human health.

              What tests are available for COVID-19?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              Tests that detect current infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are known as viral tests. There are two types: a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test, or NAAT, and an antigen test. 
Many of the NAATs use a molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect even a very tiny amount of the virus in a specimen.
The PCR test takes advantage of some natural features of biology to essentially scan through all of the RNA present in a sample — such as a nasal swab — and search for the presence of coronavirus RNA. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says NAATs ""are unlikely to return a false-negative result of SARS-CoV-2,"" and it recommends only laboratory-based NAATS, the most sensitive tests, to confirm infection. It also says saliva tests aren’t as optimal as those using swabs of the nose or nasopharynx (upper throat behind the nose).
An antigen test is designed to detect the coronavirus antigen, a structure on the surface of the virus that triggers an immune response. Also conducted via a nasal or throat swab, antigen tests are less sensitive than NAATs but inexpensive and can usually produce results in about 15 minutes. Getting a result from a NAAT test can take about an hour or even a few days.
Testing can help stop the spread of the coronavirus from those who test positive, because they can then isolate themselves from others. But, as we’ve explained, testing has its limitations. It can take a few days or even longer after exposure to the virus before it’s detectable by the diagnostic tests. So even some with negative results could be infectious.
Still, to help limit the spread, the U.S. has instituted travel requirements and recommendations. All international airline passengers, including U.S. citizens and residents, and those who are fully vaccinated, arriving in the U.S. must show ""a negative COVID-19 test, taken within three (3) calendar days of departure​, or proof of recovery from the virus within the last 90 days,"" as the State Department explains.
The CDC also recommends that everyone, including the fully vaccinated, get a viral test three to five days after returning from international travel.
The CDC recommends that those who aren’t fully vaccinated avoid international travel, and if they must travel, to get a test one to three days beforehand. The unvaccinated also should self-quarantine for seven days after returning to the U.S., even if they tested negative before or upon returning.
International destinations may have their own testing requirements as well.
As for domestic travel, the fully vaccinated don’t need to get tested, but the CDC recommends the unvaccinated follow the same guidelines as those for international travel.

Full Story
A chemical routinely used to sterilize medical devices is the focus of a misleading video on social media that questions the safety of the nasal swabs in COVID-19 testing.

In a video viewed more than 100,000 times on YouTube and shared more than 5,000 times on Facebook, a woman who identifies herself as a registered nurse and medical investigator suggests that the swabs are dangerous because the packaging indicates that they are sterilized with ethylene oxide.
""I am bringing you today information about the swab — the swab that is used for the current claimed pandemic,"" the woman, whose website advocates against vaccines, says. ""These swabs are saturated with, coated with, EO — ethylene oxide.""
The woman notes that the Environmental Protection Agency classifies ethylene oxide as a human carcinogen and says that ""ethylene oxide is mutagenic, which means it can change the DNA in your cells.""
""We’re being poisoned in every way, shape and form,"" she later says in the video.
The video also has been uploaded directly to Facebook and elsewhere online — including on the website BitChute, where a headline reads: ""ALL ABOUT THE NASAL SWAB (IT IS DESIGNED TO STERILIZE AND CAUSE CANCER).""
It’s true that the EPA says that ""ethylene oxide is carcinogenic to humans by the inhalation route of exposure"" and that ""[e]vidence in humans indicates that exposure to ethylene oxide increases the risk of lymphoid cancer and, for females, breast cancer."" It also says that ""EtO is mutagenic (i.e., it can change the DNA in a cell). Children may be more susceptible to the harmful effects of mutagenic substances.""
But the chemical is widely used to sterilize medical devices — notably those that are sensitive to heat or moisture — in a way that limits residual traces on the products, ""since long-term and occupational exposure to ethylene oxide has been linked to cancer,"" according to the Food and Drug Administration.
In fact, the FDA notes: ""Literature shows that about fifty percent of all sterile medical devices in the U.S. are sterilized with ethylene oxide.""
""The types of devices that are sterilized with ethylene oxide range from devices used in general health care practices (for example, wound dressings) to more specialized devices used to treat specific areas of the body (for example, stents),"" the FDA says.
The EPA also says that use of ethylene oxide is ""necessary to assure that some types of medical equipment are sterilized for safe use.""
Stuart Batterman, an environmental health sciences professor at the University of Michigan, told us in an email that a ""swab is briefly exposed to the gas, then removed and packed. The gas would rapidly disperse. There is no coating or liquid or anything like that on the swab.""
""By the time the swab is used, there’s likely hardly a trace of EO remaining,"" he explained. ""It is true that this gas is hazardous when breathed in at high enough concentrations for long enough periods. This is not the scenario for the occasional use of a swab.""
On the viral video, he said, ""this is fear mongering, what we call a phantom risk — it just isn’t there."" 
Experts shared similar insights with our fact-checking colleagues at the Associated Press and Full Fact, in the U.K., which have reviewed similar claims.

		Quick Take
A viral post falsely claims Walmart, Amazon, Kroger, Target and Costco — while staying open during the COVID-19 pandemic — ""have not had any reported cases"" of employees contracting the coronavirus. There have been news reports across the U.S. of workers at those companies becoming infected or dying of the disease.
Full Story
The coronavirus pandemic reached the grim milestone of more than 1 million people in the U.S. who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 by late April, as some states slowly began easing rules on businesses and stay-at-home restrictions.
But as protests against state restrictions on businesses increase, a misleading social media post falsely claims some big-box stores — which have been allowed to stay open throughout the pandemic — have reported no cases of the disease among their employees. It questions why ""smaller businesses are still not allowed to open.""
The content of the post, which has been shared widely on Facebook, is wrong on several points.
First, it claims that even with hundreds of thousands of employees, interacting with thousands of customers, at Walmart, Amazon, Kroger (misspelled ""Kroeger"" in the post), Target, and Costco (misspelled ""Cosco"" in the post), ""these companies have not had any reported cases in the news.""
This is false. There have been news reports about infections and deaths from COVID-19 at stores in these chains throughout the U.S.
Two employees at a Walmart in Chicago died from the disease, according to an April 6 article in the Washington Post.  A Walmart in Colorado had eight employees with confirmed cases, including two who died, when it was closed by local authorities on April 24, Bloomberg reported.  Four employees at a Walmart in North Las Vegas tested positive, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on April 8.
Amazon announced on April 14 that one of its employees had died from the disease, Forbes reported. And at least 74 Amazon warehouses had reported infected workers by mid-April, the Washington Post reported.
Employees at Target stores in Illinois and Michigan have tested positive for coronavirus, according to local news outlets.
A Costco employee in Texas died from COVID-19, Fox Business reported on April 10, and two employees at Costco stores in Henderson, Nevada, tested positive, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on March 31.
The viral post also claims that ""none of these companies have closed stores"" because of COVID-19 — but that is also false.  As noted above, a Walmart in Colorado was forced to close by local authorities after multiple confirmed cases of COVID-19.  Amazon also shut down a warehouse indefinitely in Kentucky after three workers tested positive in March.
The post then claims that despite the purported lack of closures at the large retail chains, ""all of a sudden all the meat packing plants are closing and small business are still not allowed to open. None of this makes any sense at all…""
This characterization is not accurate, either.
Of the nation’s 2,700 slaughterhouses, 13 meatpacking and food processing plants ceased operations over the past two months after employees tested positive for COVID-19. Some of these closures were temporary to clean facilities and test employees. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on April 28 designating meat processing plants ""critical infrastructure"" in order to reopen or keep the facilities operating.
In addition, as some states gradually lift restrictions implemented to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, they have permitted some small businesses to reopen. It’s also worth noting that ""essential"" small businesses like local grocery stores, hardware stores and daycare centers have been permitted to remain open even during stay-at-home orders.

		Quick Take
An image on social media falsely purports to show a tweet from Donald Trump in 2009, saying he ""would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office."" There is no evidence Trump ever posted that tweet.


Full Story 
Critics of President Donald Trump have at times turned to his old tweets in a bid to contrast his words from the past with his actions as president.
A supposed screenshot of such a tweet circulating on Facebook, however, shows a message that Trump never posted regarding how he would respond to a pandemic if president.
""Obama’s handling of this whole pandemic has been terrible! As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you’re entirely to blame,"" the fictitious tweet, dated Nov. 23, 2009, reads. ""John McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office.""
We could find no evidence that Trump ever posted the tweet in question — or even any tweet mentioning ""pandemic,"" ""Obama,"" or ""McCain"" in 2009. McCain was the Republican nominee for president in the 2008 election.

In fact, Trump joined Twitter in March 2009 and he posted only 56 tweets that year, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. Ten years later, in 2019, he tweeted 7,781 times (including retweets).
Trump has in recent months misleadingly compared the novel coronavirus pandemic with the H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic, which killed an estimated 12,469 people in the U.S. between April 2009 and April 2010. On Twitter, he’s called the Obama administration’s handling of that pandemic a ""total disaster"" or ""disaster"" more than once.
The bogus Trump tweet is circulating as the U.S. grapples with a rising death toll from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. There have been more than 148,000 deaths related to COVID-19 reported in the U.S.
The fictitious post has circulated since at least April. One link to the image has been shared (including recently by a page that says its mission is to ""call out the hypocrisy of the GOP"") more than 26,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.

		Quick Take
An image spreading on social media purports to show a Trump campaign email asking supporters to ""please DONATE to help him recover from"" COVID-19. It is not from the campaign, and appears to have been created as a joke.

Full Story 
In the hours after President Donald Trump revealed that he and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for the novel coronavirus, an image began circulating on Twitter that falsely suggested the Trump campaign had sent a fundraising email to supporters to capitalize on the news.
But the viral screenshot of the purported email was not, in fact, a message from the Trump campaign — and appears to have been created as a joke.
Not everyone interpreted it that way.
""[F]undraising off of his diagnosis turns my stomach. Could it be a #Covidhoax2020 ? Who knows,"" one Twitter user’s post read, in part.
Another, from the president of the Georgia NAACP, called the supposed email ""sinister and insulting."" (He later acknowledged that it was ""not a legitimate email"" from the campaign.)
The Trump campaign confirmed to FactCheck.org that the image did not show an actual email sent by the campaign.

The bogus email began, ""Friend, By now you have heard the news. President Trump and the First Lady has tested positive for the China Virus.""
It later went on to say: ""President Trump would like to ask a favor. Will you please DONATE to help him recover from this disease?""
In its fifth paragraph, the email suggested the push was to raise ""421 million to ensure our President will recover to serve another 4 years!""
That $421 million is the same figure referenced in a New York Times investigation, which found that Trump ""appears to be responsible for loans totaling $421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.""

      Biden on the Stump
              We fact-check nine claims made by the Democratic presidential nominee in recent campaign speeches.

		After months of doing mostly virtual events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden returned to in-person events with small, socially distanced crowds in September. He’s kept up his travel in October.
We reviewed Biden’s speeches on the stump between Oct. 12 and 16. He held six events over three days in swing states: two in Ohio,  two in Florida and two more in Michigan. All combined, he spoke for almost two hours and 46 minutes, or less than 30 minutes per speech. His shortest speech (in Detroit) was about 19 minutes, and his longest (in Cincinnati) was more than 34 minutes.


Here, we’ve compiled his false, misleading or exaggerated claims from those speeches.


(We published a similar story looking at statements made by President Donald Trump during his stump speeches over the same period.) 

Social Security 
In two of his speeches, Biden misleadingly focused on only part of past comments Trump has made about the payroll tax that funds Social Security, as well as only part of a government analysis of hypothetical legislation eliminating that tax.


""We’ve seen his pledge, quote, ‘to terminate the tax dedicated to financing Social Security,’"" Biden said in Toledo, Ohio. ""You know what the actuary at the Social Security department said? If it goes through … it will actually bankrupt, bankrupt Social Security by the middle of 2023.""

In an Aug. 24 letter, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary said eliminating the Social Security payroll tax without providing an alternative source of funding would deplete the trust fund for retirement benefits by 2023, ""with no ability to pay"" benefits after that year. But that’s not what Trump has proposed, as we’ve written before.
On multiple occasions in August, the president said if he wins reelection he would look at ""ending"" or ""terminating the payroll tax."" However, White House and Trump campaign officials said the president only wants Congress to forgive a four-month Social Security payroll tax holiday for employees that he authorized that month. Congress could transfer money from the government’s general fund to make up the lost tax revenue, Trump said.
Even when Trump said he was ""going to terminate the payroll tax,"" as he did in an Aug. 12 press conference, he said the money to pay benefits would instead come from general revenues. In the Aug. 24 letter, the chief actuary said a law with that stipulation would leave the Social Security program ""essentially unaffected."" 
























Preexisting Conditions
One of Biden’s most frequent claims was that if Trump gets his way, and the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act in an upcoming case, protections for more than 100 million people with preexisting health conditions would be jeopardized.

""[I]t’s all about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, which has been an obsession for this president since he became president,"" Biden said in Cincinnati. ""That’s going to take away preexisting conditions coverage for a hundred-plus million Americans.""

The 100 million figure is an estimate of how many Americans not on Medicare or Medicaid have preexisting conditions. The ACA instituted sweeping protections for those with preexisting conditions, prohibiting insurers in all markets from denying coverage or charging more based on health status. But only those seeking coverage on the individual or nongroup market would immediately be at risk of being denied insurance.


Even without the ACA, employer plans couldn’t deny issuing a policy — and could only decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.

As of 2018, nearly 20 million people, or about 6% of the U.S. population, got coverage on the individual market, where those without employer or public insurance buy plans. 
Health Insurance
Also in Cincinnati, Biden blamed Trump for millions already losing health insurance during the pandemic. ""Because of his mishandling the economy and COVID … 10 million people have already lost their employer-based health insurance, 10 million,"" Biden said.
As we’ve written, the Urban Institute did estimate that 10.1 million people were expected to lose their employer-based health insurance during the COVID-19 recession. But Biden neglected to mention that study also said that most would regain insurance from another source, leaving 3.5 million uninsured.




Face Masks

In his Southfield, Michigan, speech, while stressing the need to wear face coverings during the pandemic, Biden said of Trump: ""It’s estimated by his own folks, if we just wore masks nationally, almost 100,000 lives would be saved in the next few months. His own director of CDC said while we’re waiting for a vaccine, even if we had a vaccine, this [mask] will prevent more deaths between now and the end of January than a vaccine would.""


As we’ve noted before, 100,000-plus preventable deaths was a projection from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — not the Trump administration. On Sept. 3, IHME said increased face mask use in the U.S. could save 122,000 lives between early September and Jan. 1, 2021. As of Oct. 15, IHME said with almost universal face mask use, 74,000 lives could be saved from then until Feb. 1, 2021.
Also, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield did tell senators in congressional testimony in mid-September that face masks currently ""are the most important, powerful public health tool we have"" against COVID-19.
""I will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings,"" Redfield said. ""I have said it, if we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks we would bring this pandemic under control. … We have clear scientific evidence they work and they are our best defense.""
As far as comparing face masks and a vaccine, Redfield didn’t definitively say the former would save more lives — although he said masks may offer more protection. ""I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine,"" Redfield told the Senate panel.
He later clarified his remarks on Twitter. ""I 100% believe in the importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a #COVID19 vaccine. A COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life,"" he wrote. ""The best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds. #COVID19.""
Misquoting McConnell
As he frequently does, Biden misquoted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s response to Democratic attempts to help cities and states that have lost revenue as a result of the pandemic.
""But you know what Mitch McConnell said recently about helping the states and cities. He said, quote, ‘Let them go bankrupt,’"" Biden claimed in his Toledo speech. But, as we’ve written, McConnell said bankruptcy should be a legal option for states facing money woes unrelated to the coronavirus, such as debt due to pension programs.
In an April 22 radio interview, McConnell said: ""I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,"" when asked about states with budgetary woes predating the pandemic. The Republican senator made clear in subsequent interviews that he was saying bankruptcy should be ""an option"" to ""fix age-old problems"" in states ""wholly unrelated"" to the coronavirus pandemic. ""I wasn’t saying they had to take bankruptcy,"" he said in an April 27 Fox News Radio interview. ""I think it’s just an option to be looked at, that unfortunately states don’t have that option now, cities do.""
Ivy League Presidents
Biden, who graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School, sometimes tells the story that, if elected, he would be the first non-Ivy League president in U.S. history or, as he said more recently, at least the first in 80 or 90 years. But it’s not true.
In Toledo, Biden said he has a ""little bit of a chip on my shoulder about guys like him,"" referring to Trump, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance. ""I read some stories after I got the nomination that quote, ‘If Biden gets elected, he’ll be the first non-Ivy League school graduate to get elected in … 80 or 90 years,’"" Biden said. ""But folks, since when can someone who went to a state university not be qualified to be president?""
It’s true that the last five presidents earned degrees from Ivy League schools. But Ronald Reagan went to Eureka College. Jimmy Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy. Richard Nixon graduated from Whittier College and Duke University Law School. If Biden would win, he would be the first non-Ivy League president in 32 years.


Auto Bailout

At one of his two Michigan events, Biden recalled how, ""over the objections of many, we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry,"" referring to himself and former President Barack Obama.


The Obama administration can claim credit for helping to resuscitate the auto industry after the 2008 economic crisis. However, as we’ve explained, the rescue effort began on Dec. 19, 2008, when then-President George W. Bush announced his administration would provide General Motors and Chrysler with $13.4 billion in loans under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, plus an additional $4 billion to GM after Congress approved releasing the second half of TARP funds. As part of the deal, the automakers were required to come up with a long-term viability plan by March 31, 2009.
The companies’ viability plans were ultimately rejected on March 30, 2009, by Obama, who later announced an agreement on a restructuring plan for Chrysler and GM on April 30 and June 1, respectively. As a result, the automakers filed for bankruptcy, restructured their companies and got more federal assistance. In total, the Treasury Department invested about $80 billion in the auto industry and ended up getting back all but $9.3 billion of that amount.
Beau Biden
In nearly all of his stump speeches, Biden mentioned his late son, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015. But in his remarks in Pembroke Pines, Florida, Biden falsely suggested that Beau was the only ""foreigner"" to have his own monument and highway in Kosovo. 
""My son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year,"" Biden said of Beau, who served in the Delaware Army National Guard. ""Before that, he had been in Kosovo for eight months. Best of my knowledge, the only foreigner who has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contribution to helping them set up their criminal justice system.""
In 2016, the Kosovo government did unveil a statue dedicated to Beau, ""who worked in Kosovo after the 1998-99 war ended, helping train local prosecutors and judges for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,"" according to Reuters. The country also renamed a highway leading to an American military base after him as well. But he’s not the only American to receive such an honor.
As Time magazine wrote: ""The ethnically Albanian and predominantly Muslim statelet at the southern-most tip of what was once Yugoslavia is perhaps the most pro-American country in the world. Its capital, Pristina, has boulevards named for presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush (spelled Xhorxh Bush) and a street named for Bob Dole. It also features an 11-foot tall statue of Clinton."" The statue of Clinton was revealed in 2009.
Reuters said: ""Clinton, as leader of the NATO alliance, is seen as the man who decided to bomb Serbia to force the late strongman Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, effectively handing victory to the Kosovo Liberation Army.""

      Trump and the ‘New Hoax’

		7.9KDemocratic presidential candidates harshly criticized President Donald Trump for using the term ""hoax"" in connection with the coronavirus outbreak. There’s no question that the president described the disease as the Democrats’ ""new hoax"" at a political rally on Feb. 28 in South Carolina.
But the following day, after the death of the first American from coronavirus in Washington state, Trump said that when he used the word ""hoax,"" he was referring to Democrats finding fault with his administration’s response to coronavirus, not the virus itself.
Even after Trump explained his remarks, some Democrats — including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg — continued to wrongly accuse Trump of describing the coronavirus as a ""hoax.""
The kerfuffle began at the rally in North Charleston, South Carolina when Trump accused the Democrats of ""politicizing"" the coronavirus outbreak.
""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right?"" he said. ""Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.""
Then the president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation as a hoax, continued, ""They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.""
Trump went on to praise his administration for taking ""the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States,"" referring to travel restrictions on foreign nationals who recently visited China. 
""A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,"" Trump said, ""and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right?""
Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on Trump’s ""hoax"" remark. Former Vice President Joe Biden described the president’s comments as ""absolutely bizarre""
""Look, this is a serious, serious problem,"" Biden told MSNBC on Feb. 29. ""It’s able to be solved, but it requires us to be absolutely level-headed and let the scientists have the lead in all of this,"" Biden said. ""But for him to start talking about it being a hoax is absolutely dangerous. It’s just not a decent way to act.""
Biden told reporters in Greenville, South Carolina, on Feb. 29 ""The president of the United States says it’s a hoax? It’s hard to believe. Even for him it’s hard to believe.""
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, at the time still a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, also said he was troubled by Trump’s use of the term ""hoax.""
""It’s critically important that the administration and the White House handle this in a way that’s based on science and not based on politics,"" Buttigieg said on NBC’s ""Today"" show on Feb. 29. ""I was particularly disturbed to hear the word ‘hoax’ used by the president recently in talking about this issue."" 
Buttigieg ended his run for the White House on March 1.
In the wake of the criticism, Trump said at a press conference on Feb. 29 that he used the term ""hoax"" to refer not to coronavirus itself but to Democrats’ criticism of how his administration had responded to it.
Asked if he regretted using that particular word, he replied ""No. No. No. Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them not… I’m not talking about what’s happening here. I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff…""
But that hardly put an end to criticism from Democrats.
In an interview on CBS’ ""60 Minutes"" on March 1, Bloomberg said, ""I find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did [Friday] night in South Carolina.""
Correspondent Scott Pelley responded, ""He said that the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.""
And Bloomberg shot back, ""This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world would say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, ‘We don’t know, but we have to prepare for the fact that, if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it.'""
A day later, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, similarly criticized Trump at a Biden rally on March 1 in Norfolk, Virginia.
""We got a guy in the White House who doesn’t know anything about patriotism, doesn’t know anything about empathy,"" McAuliffe said. ""He said the coronavirus was a hoax.""
But that’s not what Trump said he meant.

      The Falsehoods of the ‘Plandemic’ Video
      
      
         By Angelo Fichera, Saranac Hale Spencer, D'Angelo Gore, Lori Robertson and Eugene KielyPosted on May 8, 2020 | Updated on June 29, 2021
      

    

    

    

      
      



      

        
        
        

          


	

		The first installment of a documentary called ""Plandemic"" stormed through social media this week, promising viewers on its website that the film will ""expose the scientific and political elite who run the scam that is our global health system."" The video appeared across platforms, with individual uploads each garnering hundreds of thousands of views.
But the viral video, running nearly 26 minutes, weaves a grand conspiracy theory by using a host of false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus pandemic and its origins, vaccines, treatments for COVID-19, and more.
The video is largely an interview with Judy Mikovits, a former chronic fatigue researcher who has lobbed a number of accusations against National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. Mikovits was an author on a controversial 2009 study linking a retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome that was published in the journal Science, and then retracted in late 2011 after labs were unable to replicate the results and other issues were brought to light.
That same year, in September 2011, Mikovits was fired from her position as research director at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada and arrested two months later after the institute alleged she stole a laptop, flash drives and other property with institute information. While Mikovits claims in the documentary that she was held in jail despite being charged with ""nothing,"" a criminal complaint from November 2011 shows she was charged with two felonies related to the stolen property. The charges were later dropped.
What followed was a years-long legal battle in which Whittemore won a civil judgment against Mikovits; Mikovits filed for bankruptcy; and Mikovits alleged that Whittemore defrauded the government by misusing federally funded research materials. The latter case was dismissed this year.
Mikovits recently co-authored a book with self-described ""anti-vaxxer"" Kent Heckenlively, with a forward by vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr., and has spoken at events aimed at discrediting vaccines. 
In the video, she claims, ""And they will kill millions as they already have with their vaccines."" It’s unclear what vaccines she’s referring to, but vaccines have been credited with saving millions of lives. For instance, according to one estimate by researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the measles vaccine has saved more than 20 million lives across the globe from 2000 to 2016 alone.
In the sections below, we break down eight of the false, misleading and unfounded claims aired in ""Plandemic.""

Unfounded Attacks on Fauci
Scientists: Novel Coronavirus Not ‘Manipulated’
Misleading Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding
Flu Vaccines Don’t Contain Coronaviruses
No Evidence Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19
Hydroxychloroquine: Unproven COVID-19 Therapy
Wrong Message on Masks
False Suggestion About Ebola

Unfounded Attacks on Fauci
The first part of the video focuses largely on two sweeping, but unrelated, accusations against Fauci, who also has been a fixture at the White House briefings on COVID-19.
Without offering any evidence, the video claims that Fauci was part of a ""cover-up"" and that he worked with other doctors to ""take credit and make money"" on the AIDS epidemic.
Filmmaker Mikki Willis sets the tone for this section of the video, saying to Mikovits, ""So Anthony Fauci, the man who is heading the pandemic task force, was involved in a cover-up."" Willis, a former model, has a large following on YouTube, where he has previously claimed the novel coronavirus was ""intentionally released.""
""He directed the cover-up,"" Mikovits says. ""And, in fact, everybody else was paid off, and paid off big time.""
But at no point in the video does anyone explain what Fauci supposedly covered up.
We asked Mikovits in a phone interview to explain. She said it was a reference to her 2009 research paper that was later retracted. Mikovits holds Fauci responsible and claims it was part of a ""cover-up"" on the part of the medical establishment to keep hidden her research linking a mouse retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome. In the years since the research was first published, Mikovits has expanded its reach, suggesting that it could apply also to prostate cancer, lymphoma, and autism.
The NIAID funded Mikovits’ initial research related to chronic fatigue syndrome, and, after she was fired, another researcher at Whittemore was awarded the remaining grant money. But there is no evidence that Fauci, personally, had anything to do with it. And the journal that published the paper made no mention of Fauci in its retraction. Rather, it explained it was ""fully retracting"" the paper because the results couldn’t be replicated, even in the same lab, and ""there is evidence of poor quality control in a number of specific experiments in the Report.""
As for the claim about the AIDS epidemic, that goes back much further. In the early 1980s, Mikovits was working as a technician at the National Cancer Institute. She claims that the lab she was in had identified the HIV virus from blood and saliva samples and prepared a paper detailing those findings that was slated for publication.
But, she says in the video, referencing one of the pioneers of AIDS research, Dr. Robert Gallo, ""Fauci holds up the paper for several months, while Robert Gallo writes his own paper and takes all the credit.""
Mikovits could not provide the name of her lab’s paper or the journal that was going to publish it when we spoke to her, so we couldn’t check on that. But here’s what we do know about the timeline for AIDS research in the early 1980s:
1981 – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describing a rare lung infection in five young gay men in Los Angeles. Fauci would later recall seeing that article, saying in a 2011 interview, ""I remember putting the issue to the side of my desk, thinking, ‘Wow, what a bizarre curiosity.’ One month later, in July, a second MMWR report came to my desk, and this time, an additional 26 men had it, again all gay, all seemingly healthy, and not only in LA, but now also in San Francisco and New York City. I remember reading it very clearly. It was the first time in my medical career I actually got goose pimples. I knew something was very wrong. It changed the direction of my career.""
1982 – The CDC used the term AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, for the first time.
1983 – A group of French researchers identified the virus now known as HIV. Twenty-five years later, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier were awarded the Nobel Prize for that discovery.
1984 – A team led by Gallo at the National Cancer Institute published research showing that HIV causes AIDS.
Beyond the unsupported claim that Fauci — who didn’t become the director of NIAID until 1984 — stymied early AIDS research at the National Cancer Institute, Mikovits also claims that he has profited from the epidemic.
Referring vaguely to patents, Mikovits says in the video that Fauci was working with other researchers ""to take credit and make money"" on the AIDS epidemic. It’s true that Fauci’s name appears on at least six patents related to AIDS research. But it’s less clear how much he has profited from them. In 2005, the Health and Human Services Department was criticized for not disclosing how much government scientists were collecting from patent royalties. At the time, Fauci expressed concern over the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest and said that he donated all of his royalty money to charity.
Scientists: Novel Coronavirus Not ‘Manipulated’
Mikovits makes a claim that numerous scientists have refuted: that the novel coronavirus ""was manipulated"" in a laboratory and is not ""naturally occurring.""
""So it’s very clear this virus was manipulated, these, this family of viruses was manipulated and studied in a laboratory where the animals were taken into the laboratory,"" she says in the video. ""And this is what was released, whether deliberate or not, that cannot be naturally occurring. Somebody didn’t go to a market, get a bat. The virus didn’t jump directly to humans. That’s not how it works. That’s accelerated viral evolution. If it was a natural occurrence, it would take it up to 800 years to occur. This occurred from SARS-1 within a decade. That is not naturally occurring.""
The exact origin of the coronavirus is not known, but scientists have said the genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 indicate it was neither created in a lab nor manipulated.
""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" said an article published in Nature Medicine in March. Instead, the authors said it’s plausible that the coronavirus originated in one of two ways: ""natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,"" which refers to the spread of disease from animals to humans, or ""natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.""
The authors said the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out, but they ""do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible"" because they had observed ""all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.""
In a statement in April, University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, likewise said: ""Coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 are commonly found in wildlife species and frequently jump to new hosts. This is also the most likely explanation for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.""
Holmes said there is ""unfounded speculation"" that a bat coronavirus named RaTG13, which was being kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was the origin of the new coronavirus. But, he explained, that is not the case, for several reasons.
""In summary, the abundance, diversity and evolution of coronaviruses in wildlife strongly suggests that this virus is of natural origin,"" Holmes said. He added that more sampling of other animals ""is needed to resolve the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2.""
Mikovits also may give viewers a false impression when she says the novel coronavirus ""occurred from SARS-1,"" which is a different coronavirus that caused a global outbreak in 2003.
SARS-CoV, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is similar but distinct from SARS-CoV-2. The viruses share about 79% of the same genetic make-up, but SARS-CoV-2 is even more closely related (96%) to the bat coronavirus from which Holmes has said SARS-CoV-2 wasn’t derived.
We’ve already written about a bogus analysis that suggested the new coronavirus could have leaked from a Chinese lab because a portion of its genome is similar to part of a viral vector that was used in previous research on SARS.
Kristian Andersen, the director of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told us in an email that analysis was ""completely wrong.""
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for ""more investigation"" to determine how the pandemic began. ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,"" they wrote. ""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""
Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story ""The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus"" for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic. 
Misleading Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding
Also on the issue of the Wuhan lab, the video shows a clip claiming that ""$3.7 million flowed from the National Institutes of Health here in the U.S. to the Wuhan lab in China"" and that NIAID ""had already been conducting experiments with the Wuhan lab in the past in regard to coronavirus.""
That’s misleading.
The project referenced, as other fact-checkers have previously reported, is actually funding from NIAID to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit that researches emerging infectious diseases. The project was done to ""examine the risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China,"" in particular the risk posed by bats, according to a 2014 description.
NIH records show the project was awarded nearly $3.4 million altogether. Most of the funding was through a five-year grant awarded in 2014, Robert Kessler, an EcoHealth spokesman, said in an email to us. The group was renewed for a second five-year grant in 2019 and received $292,161 — but NIH recently terminated the grant.
Of that money, only $600,000 (from the first grant) was given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Kessler said. The Wuhan lab was a collaborator that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department, he added, and one that researchers used to conduct genetic analyses of the viruses.
""In each of nearly 30 countries around the world where we work, we collaborate with local institutions, all of which are pre-approved by our federal funders,"" EcoHealth said in an April 28 statement about the terminated funding. ""It’s been EcoHealth Alliance’s position for the past 15 years that coronaviruses present a clear and immediate threat to our safety. That seems clearer now than ever before.""
The group said its research ""aimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats. In fact, genetic sequences of two bat coronaviruses that we discovered with this grant have been used as lab tools to test the breakthrough antiviral drug Remdesivir.""
So it’s incorrect, and also lacks context, to claim NIAID gave ""$3.7 million"" to the Wuhan lab.
Flu Vaccines Don’t Contain Coronaviruses
Mikovits falsely claims that ""if you’ve ever had a flu vaccine, you were injected with coronaviruses.""
""She’s wrong,"" Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview. ""That’s not true.""
""This person doesn’t know what she is talking about,"" Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email, adding, ""I think this person is just seeking publicity.""
In an interview, we asked Mikovits what support she had for the claim, and she didn’t provide any. She only said that flu vaccines are cultured in chicken eggs and dog kidney cells, and those animals have coronaviruses. It’s an extreme leap to then claim animal strains of coronaviruses end up in vaccines tested and approved for people. Mikovits further said she attributes the spread of the novel coronavirus worldwide ""at least in part"" to the use of the flu vaccine.
As we’ve explained before, coronaviruses are a diverse family of viruses, and some, such as canine coronavirus, infect animals. Those aren’t the same as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
As for influenza vaccines, most are made using hen’s eggs, Offit explained, and about 10% of vaccines in the U.S. are cell-culture vaccines, which use mammalian cells instead of eggs. Specifically, the process uses Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK, cells.
""These lines have been around for a long time,"" Offit said. ""This is a well-tested … cell line that does not contain coronavirus"" and ""would never be allowed to.""
On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more information on how egg-based and cell-based influenza vaccines are manufactured. A cell-based method that also used eggs at the beginning of the process received Food and Drug Administration approval in 2012, and a fully cell-based process got FDA approval in 2016.
The CDC notes that once vaccines are manufactured, ""FDA tests and approves the vaccines prior to release and shipment.""
This cell-based technology has been used in other U.S. vaccines, ""including vaccines for rotavirus, polio, smallpox, hepatitis, rubella and chickenpox,"" the CDC says.
No Evidence Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19
Mikovits also repeats the unsubstantiated claim that ""the flu vaccines increase the odds by 36% of getting COVID-19,"" which we’ve previously covered.
Experts say that there has been no study linking the flu shot to elevated risk for the novel coronavirus. The military study cited by Mikovits involved four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2.
More than that, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person had an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone’s chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they’ve been vaccinated for the flu.
Multiple scientists have pointed out the same issue in other fact-checks, too, and have debunked the erroneous suggestion that the study looked at SARS-CoV-2.
The Military Health System told us in a statement that ""the study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19."" MHS further said ""it remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.""
Hydroxychloroquine: Unproven COVID-19 Therapy
The video makes the unsubstantiated claim that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine is ""the most effective medication to treat"" COVID-19, citing a survey of doctors.
Shortly after that, Mikovits says hydroxychloroquine is ""effective against these families of viruses,"" referring to the family of coronaviruses, such as COVID-19, but ""they keep it from the people.""
We have covered this ground before when President Donald Trump encouraged the off-label use of chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Both drugs are used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
But there is only limited evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for COVID-19, and it carries potential health risks.
The National Institutes of Health says there is ""insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.""
Despite insufficient clinical data, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization, or EUA, order on March 28 that allowed for the drugs to be used as a treatment for some hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
A little less than a month later, the FDA issued a warning against using ""hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems."" The warning came a few days after a study found that patients at Veterans Health Administration medical centers treated with hydroxychloroquine had an increased mortality risk compared with those that were not treated with the drug.
In the video, Mikovits says, ""The AMA was saying doctors will lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that’s been on the list of essential medicine worldwide for 70 years. Dr. Fauci calls that ‘anecdotal.’ It’s not storytelling if we have thousands of pages of data saying it’s effective against these families of viruses. This is essential medicine and they keep it from the people.""
It’s not true that the American Medical Association told doctors they ""will lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine"" for COVID-19. The AMA issued a statement saying it opposed ""purchasing excessive amounts"" of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for possible COVID-19 treatment. But it also said, ""Novel off-label use of FDA-approved medications is a matter for the physician’s or other prescriber’s professional judgment.""
As for hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness against coronaviruses, we have written that at least two studies show that it has antiviral activity against the novel coronavirus in cells grown in the lab. But there is only anecdotal evidence that the drug works in people.
Trump cited in a tweet the results of a small clinical trial in France, but the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal in which the study appeared, later issued a statement that said ""the article does not meet the Society’s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.""
We cover this more extensively in our story ""Trump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim.""
Wrong Message on Masks
In attacking public health measures taken to address the pandemic in the U.S., Mikovits wrongly suggests that using masks could lead to people infecting themselves with their own breath. ""Wearing the mask literally activates your own virus,"" Mikovits said. ""You’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2, then you’ve got a big problem.""
Experts were perplexed by what she meant and said the implication that simply breathing through a mask could lead to self-infection doesn’t square with science.
Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, told us: ""If you’re shedding (breathing out) virus, then you’re already infected. Even without a mask, infected people who are shedding virus probably rebreathe some of their own viruses, but there are already billions times more viruses in your body. Hopefully, the mask is protecting other people from your exhalations.""
And Lisa Brosseau, an expert on respiratory protection and infectious diseases and a certified industrial hygienist, said in an email that ""viruses are not ‘activated’ by anything,"" as Mikovits suggests.
Viruses instead ""require living cells in order to replicate,"" but their viability or ability to replicate isn’t affected whether someone is wearing a mask or not, said Brosseau, a former professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. If anything, viruses in the environment can be ""rendered non-viable by exposure to certain temperature"" and relative humidity conditions. 
""There is nothing magical about our breath that ‘activates’ or ‘reactivates’ a virus,"" Brosseau said.
As we’ve previously written, while there is little research on cloth masks, the hope is that they can help prevent individuals, even those who do not feel sick, from unknowingly spreading COVID-19 to others. Brosseau said people should frequently wash cloth masks, though, and stressed that masks are not a substitute for social distancing. The CDC notes the same.
False Suggestion About Ebola
Mikovits says in the video: ""In 1999, I was working in Fort Detrick … and my job was to teach Ebola how to infect human cells without killing them. Ebola couldn’t infect human cells until we took it in the laboratories and taught them.""
It’s not clear what she meant by that, and she didn’t explain when we asked about her claim.
But the suggestion that Ebola, which includes six species of ebolaviruses, didn’t infect people until 1999, or later, is false.
The first two species, Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus, were discovered after outbreaks in 1976 in Central Africa. Combined, those two viruses, which scientists believe may have come from bats or nonhuman primates (such as chimpanzees, apes, monkeys, etc.), killed about 430 people that year, according to the CDC.
Zaire ebolavirus — which is also linked to the largest Ebola outbreak which began in West Africa in 2014 — is said to have initially spread in 1976 through the use of contaminated needles and syringes at a hospital in the village where the first infected person was treated. And the Sudan ebolavirus is believed to have started with workers in a cotton factory.
In fact, the CDC says four of the six species of ebolavirus — Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Taï Forest ebolavirus (formerly Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus — are known to cause disease in people. And three of the four species were discovered prior to 1999.
A fifth species, Reston ebolavirus, was first discovered in 1989 in research monkeys imported into the U.S. from the Philippines. That species ""is known to cause disease in nonhuman primates and pigs, but not in people,"" the CDC says. There have been cases in which individuals developed Reston ebolavirus antibodies, but did not experience symptoms.
The sixth species, Bombali ebolavirus, was discovered in 2018 in a bat in Sierra Leone. It also is not known to infect humans.

      An April Filled with Repeats
              The president has used the coronavirus briefings to repeatedly misstate the facts about his administration's handling of the pandemic, the economy and trade with China.

		Throughout April, the White House’s coronavirus task force briefings, at times, sparked feelings of fact-checking deja vu: President Donald Trump made many of the same inaccurate statements repeatedly.
The president – as is the case with many politicians – has exhibited a penchant for reiterating his talking points. But that political trait is compounded when Trump speaks in near daily briefings, many running well over an hour.
These news conferences contained information about how the coronavirus outbreak was affecting the United States, which has had more than 1 million cases and 60,000 deaths, and the government’s response to it.
But they also harbored this lengthy list of false, unsupported and misleading assertions — both on the pandemic and old standards we have been debunking for months, if not years. For more information on these claims, see the links provided below to our original stories.
Travel Restrictions on China
The president often talked about travel restrictions on China that his administration announced on Jan. 31 as a significant action to combat the coronavirus. But he exaggerated what those restrictions entailed and made unsubstantiated claims about their impact.
Not a ""travel ban."" Three times during April — on April 7, 13 and 14 — he said he had imposed a ""travel ban."" On April 8, he said he had ""closed the border."" But the Trump administration’s travel restrictions stopped well short of a ""ban."" They were not absolute.
When Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the restrictions, he said the policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. But he said the new rules didn’t apply to U.S. citizens and their immediate family members. In addition, the rules don’t apply to permanent U.S. residents. And they don’t bar importing goods from China.
A New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect. So Trump had hardly ""closed the border.""
On six occasions in April, Trump said he had been ""early"" in imposing restrictions on travel from China. For example, on April 1, he said he acted to ban ""dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people. And we did that early — far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else.""
But, as we have reported, 36 countries imposed travel restrictions by Feb. 2, the day the U.S. restrictions went into effect.
""What this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,"" Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us via email. Kiernan is co-author of a council project, Think Global Health, that has been tracking travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19.
See ""The Facts on Trump’s Travel Restrictions"" and ""Trump, Biden Spin Travel Restrictions.""  
Impact of travel restrictions. Without evidence, in at least two briefings, the president claimed that the travel restrictions he implemented on China ""saved tens of thousands"" and even ""hundreds of thousands of lives,"" after using more general terms such as ""a tremendous number"" in March. We found no support for such figures, and the White House didn’t provide any.
The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
We found no study that looked only at the U.S. travel restrictions Trump instituted, and we found only one study, which wasn’t peer-reviewed, on Australia, that found an impact on decreasing the number of deaths — but the study had a major limitation. It didn’t consider any impact of cases coming to Australia from other countries besides China.
As we’ve written (twice), it’s possible the U.S. travel restrictions on China had some impact in slowing the importation of cases, but we don’t have evidence of that, or of what the magnitude of the impact would be.
In one briefing, on April 14, Trump claimed that countries that didn’t put travel restrictions on China now ""have problems the likes of which they cannot believe,"" but there’s no discernible pattern in the trajectories of COVID-19 cases between countries with such restrictions and those without, according to charts created by Think Global Health.
See ""Trump’s Snowballing China Travel Claim"" and ""FactChecking Trump’s Attack on the WHO.""
Testing and the Stockpile
In the face of criticism for being slow to ramp up testing and questions about the demand for emergency medical supplies, Trump has responded with misleading comparisons to other countries and misplaced blame for his predecessors.
Testing compared with other countries. At least five times, Trump misleadingly claimed that the U.S. had conducted ""more tests"" or ""the most"" for coronavirus cases ""of any country,"" even adding ""by far"" or ""it’s not even close."" But the U.S. still lags behind other countries in testing on a per-capita basis.
The per-capita number is important, because testing a higher proportion of the population gives countries a greater ability to control the spread of COVID-19.
The president first made this claim in late March, when he made a misleading comparison on the amount of testing done in the U.S. and South Korea, a country that had been held up as an example of how early, extensive testing can help contain the coronavirus outbreak. At that time, South Korea, and other countries, had done more tests on a per-capita basis than the United States.
Trump continued to make the claim throughout April, and eventually, the U.S. per-capita testing did outpace that of South Korea — but it still hasn’t caught up to that of other countries.
Charts compiled by Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford, show the U.S. leads the pack in the sheer number of coronavirus tests, but several countries, as of April 28, had done more testing per-capita, including Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Spain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.
Another source, Worldometer, a data aggregation website, showed the U.S. doing nearly 19,000 tests per 1 million people, as of April 30. But that was a lower figure than those of 42 other countries and territories. 
There are differences in the way each country reports this data; Our World in Data notes: ""there are substantial differences across countries in terms of the units, whether or not all labs are included, the extent to which negative and pending tests are included and other aspects.""
Trump also repeatedly claimed in April that the U.S. has ""the best tests,"" but we found no evidence of that. 
Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us in late March, after the president first made this claim, that there’s ""no data that would support"" the claim, and ""no reason to believe US tests are any better (or worse)"" than those being run in other countries. Sampath told us again in late April that there still wasn’t support for the claim.
See ""Trump’s Faulty Testing Claims.""
Misleading claims of a ""broken system."" Throughout April, the president repeatedly misled the public by claiming he had ""inherited a broken system"" from previous administrations. Once, he referred to it as a ""broken test.""
As we explained, the president would have a point were he to say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alone couldn’t conduct the amount of testing this pandemic demanded, a point Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made in March. But several former officials also have said the CDC simply isn’t set up to be a commercial test lab, nor the only source of testing for the entire country.
""The CDC designed a good system."" Fauci said on March 13. ""If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector.""
But, as we showed in a timeline of testing in the U.S., it was a month after the administration declared a public health emergency (on Jan. 31) that it took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly. The Food and Drug Administration said on Feb. 29 that it would allow labs to create and use their own in-house tests immediately. And it took several days more before the private sector announced testing availability. 
Another problem was a manufacturing issue with the CDC’s test kits that were sent to state and local public health labs in early February. It took more than two weeks for the CDC to provide a fix for that issue.
See ""Trump’s Spin on ‘Broken’ Testing.""
Coronavirus mortality rates. Currently available data do not support Trump’s April 21 claim that the U.S. has ""one of the lowest"" or ""most successful"" COVID-19 mortality rates ""in the entire world."" He similarly said on April 16, ""the United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries."" 
Johns Hopkins University is tracking coronavirus mortality numbers for nearly 140 countries, and, as of April 29, the U.S. (5.9%) had the 36th highest case fatality ratio (confirmed deaths divided by confirmed cases) and the 12th highest number of deaths (18.63) per 100,000 people.
These fatality rates, we should note, are based on only the known coronavirus cases and deaths. Unreported cases and deaths are not included, and because of that, it’s difficult to say with certainty what the rate of death from the disease is in any country.


Trump was more on target with his April 18 claim that, ""on a per capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of Western Europe, with the lone exception of possibly Germany."" Available data as of April 29 showed the U.S. has had fewer deaths per 100,000 people than Belgium (65.67), Spain (51.95), Italy (45.81), the United Kingdom (39.35), France (36.01) and the Netherlands (27.43). Those European nations, and Germany (7.80) along with the U.S., are all among the ""10 countries most affected by COVID-19 worldwide,"" according to Johns Hopkins University. 
See ""Trump’s Inaccurate COVID-19 Death Rate Comparison.""
Strategic National Stockpile wasn’t ""empty."" Trump has frequently claimed — falsely — that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies was ""empty"" or ""bare"" when he took office.
We counted nine times Trump made this claim in April task force briefings. On April 19, he said that ""initially … our stockpiles were empty. We had horrible stockpiles."" Prior to that, on April 13, he said, ""The whole administration, we inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing. … [W]e didn’t have medical supplies, we didn’t have ventilators, we didn’t have a lot of things that should have been had."" 
That’s not so. The government does not disclose the exact counts of the stockpile’s contents, but, as of 2016, the year before Trump took office, there were at least six warehouses holding ""approximately $7 billion in products across more than 900 separate line items,"" according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Plus, reporters who were allowed to tour at least one of the secret U.S. facilities that year described seeing ""shelves packed with stuff"" and ""row after row of containers filled with mystery medications and equipment — including that one item everyone’s been talking about lately, ventilators.""
It’s true that some personal protective equipment that was distributed from the stockpile to states during the Obama administration — such as 85 million N95 respirator masks for the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 — were not restocked, according to news reports. But that doesn’t mean there were none of those items in the stockpile when Trump was inaugurated in early 2017. 
See ""Trump Falsely Claims He Inherited ‘Empty’ Stockpile.""
Hydroxychloroquine
In March, Trump first touted two existing drugs — chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine — as potential treatments for COVID-19. Both drugs are used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, but the president was pushing for off-label use of the drugs for COVID-19.
As we wrote at the time, there has been only limited evidence to suggest the drugs might be effective against the new virus, and the drugs come with dangerous side effects that affect the heart. At a March 20 briefing, Fauci said that without controlled clinical trials ""you really can’t make any definitive statement"" about the effectiveness of the drugs as COVID-19 therapies.   
Pushing an unproven treatment. Still, on at least five occasions in April, Trump made false and misleading claims about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, while downplaying the drug’s risks. 
On April 3, the president said that hydroxychloroquine is ""looking like it’s having some good results,"" when in fact there was only anecdotal evidence.
A day later, the president made the false claim that ""there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus."" As we wrote, there is no such study, and, in fact, lupus patients have contracted COVID-19. And he claimed ""malaria countries … have very little of this virus,"" citing nonexistent ""studies."" In fact, hydroxychloroquine is not widely used for malaria in much of the world, we found.
On April 5, he said that ""there are some very strong, powerful signs"" the drug works against COVID-19. ""[Y]ou know the expression, I’ve used it for certain reasons: ‘What do you have to lose?’ "" Trump said.
On April 8, Trump said his administration had purchased ""30 million doses"" of hydroxychloroquine for the Strategic National Stockpile, based on ""a lot of good stories"" and ""some very good results"" that the drug worked against COVID-19.
Toward the end of the month, the president was asked why he wasn’t talking much about hydroxychloroquine anymore, and he acknowledged that the results were mixed. ""We’ve had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren’t so good,"" he said at the April 23 briefing.
The next day, the FDA issued a warning against using ""hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems."" The warning came a few days after a study found that patients at Veterans Health Administration medical centers treated with hydroxychloroquine had an increased mortality risk compared with those that were not treated with the drug.
See ""Trump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim.""
Pelosi
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of Trump’s favorite foils, and he repeatedly distorted the facts on Pelosi’s actions.
Pelosi and Chinatown. Six times in April, Trump inaccurately described what Pelosi did when she went to San Francisco’s Chinatown on Feb. 24. Trump variously said Pelosi held a ""rally"" in Chinatown, was having or wanted to have ""parties"" or a ""street party"" there and encouraged people to go to a ""big parade.""
Trump contrasted his administration’s announcement of travel restrictions on China on Jan. 31 with Pelosi supposedly encouraging public events during the pandemic.
Pelosi did visit Chinatown on Feb. 24, telling people it was safe there and urging them to shop and eat there at a time when tourism was suffering because of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year. But her visit came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the same day as Pelosi’s visit, Trump tweeted, ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!""
Pelosi never mentioned parties or rallies. And her visit came two weeks after the Chinese New Year parade on Feb. 8.
See ""Trump’s False Claims About Pelosi and Chinatown.""
Economic Impact
At a time of economic turmoil due to the pandemic, Trump has returned to a familiar, and false, boast about how well the economy was doing previously.
Not the ""greatest economy."" On 11 occasions in April, Trump said that the United States had ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before it was shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, on April 10, he used a variation, ""the greatest economy ever created."" And on April 4, he settled for the more modest ""greatest economy in the world.""
It’s certainly true that the economy was in good shape, with stocks soaring (the Dow Jones Industrial Average had a record close at 29,551.42 on Feb. 12), and unemployment was low. But it wasn’t the greatest economy in history. 
As we have reported, the economy has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration.
Trump had promised annual growth rates of 4% to 6% repeatedly, both as a candidate and as president. But the nation’s real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product has yet to reach even 3% a year under Trump. The real GDP grew 2.3% last year — down from 2.9% in 2018, according to data released on Feb. 27.
Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 2.9% 19 times. Under Reagan, real GDP grew by more than 3% in six of his eight years, including 7.2% in 1984. Under President George W. Bush, real GDP grew 3.8% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2005. The best year under President Barack Obama was in 2015, when it reached 2.9%, equaling the best year under Trump in 2018.  
Unemployment has been very low under Trump, falling to a 50-year low of 3.5% in December 2019. It was 3.6% in January, before the arrival of the novel coronavirus. But as far as job creation goes, as we have written, in the 35 months after Trump took office, the economy added just under 6.7 million jobs. In the 35 months before he took office, the economy added nearly 8 million jobs.
Trump’s repeated false claims of once having the ""greatest economy in the history of the world"" come at a time when the pandemic has devastated the U.S. economy. More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the last six weeks. The unemployment rate jumped to 4.4% in March and is expected to be much higher in April.
See ""FactChecking the State of the Union"" and ""FactChecking Trump’s Scranton Town Hall."" 
Reliable Repeats
Trump’s rhetoric went beyond the coronavirus crisis at hand, touching on familiar falsehoods, particularly about trade with China.
Still exaggerates trade deficit with China. Trump repeated a false claim that dates back to his time as a presidential candidate, saying on April 7, ""We had a deficit — a trade deficit — with China for years of $500 billion, $400 billion,"" and repeating the $500 billion figure three more times later in the month. That’s wrong.
The U.S. trade deficit with China on goods and services was $308.9 billion in 2016, the year before Trump took office and $333.5 billion the year before that. Figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis dating back to 1999 show the total trade deficit with China never hit even $400 billion.
Trump’s $500 billion figure is close to what the total U.S. trade deficit was with all countries before he was inaugurated: $503 billion in 2016. But that trade deficit has gone up under Trump’s presidency, not down. In 2019, it was $616.4 billion.
In the April 21 press conference, Trump made his false claim about the trade deficit with China, adding, ""Now, if you look at this last year, the deficit went way down."" It hasn’t gone ""way down"" compared with the deficit when he took office. It was $307.6 billion in 2019, merely $1.3 billion below the deficit in 2016. Last year’s figure was a drop from 2018, when the deficit with China hit $380.8 billion under Trump.
See ""Trump’s Habit of Inflating Trade Deficits.""
Tariffs on China. The president continued his trade spin in the April 27 briefing, falsely saying that the U.S. ""never took in 10 cents from China"" before he increased tariffs on goods imported from the country. In fact, the U.S. has collected billions annually in customs duties on Chinese imports for years.
Trump said, ""We took in tens of billions of dollars."" And it’s true that the amount of customs duties has increased substantially since he began a trade war with China. In 2016, the year before Trump took office, the U.S. collected $13.3 billion in customs duties on Chinese imports; the figure went up to $23 billion in 2018. Last year, customs duties totaled $45.5 billion, according to information from the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb, which uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
But it’s simply false to say, as the president also did in press briefings on April 14 and April 15, that China ""never paid us 10 cents"" in tariffs. 
He’s also wrong to say China is the one paying these tariffs, a false point he emphasized on April 18, saying, ""We didn’t pay. China paid."" Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, and to some extent by U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. Former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn told NPR in a May 2019 interview: ""For every dollar of tariff that’s collected, it’s coming out of disposable income of the United States consumer today.""
See ""Trump Wrong on China Trade, Again"" and ""Does China Pay Tariffs?""
China trade deal. As he has in the past, Trump repeatedly exaggerated the impact of the two-year trade agreement that the U.S. and China signed on Jan. 15.
Trump, April 6: I want to say one other thing. Our farmers — we love our farmers — and, as you know, as of April 1st, the China trade deal — 250-billion-dollar — they purchased $250 billion from us, if not more. And of that, approximately $50 billion is expected to be with our farmers.
On April 18, he repeated the claim, saying, ""we just made a trade deal where China is going to have to buy $250 billion a year on our product""; on April 19, he claimed China would buy ""$40- to $50 billion"" from farmers, adding the false claim that ""the most they ever spent was 15 to 16"" billion. And he brought up the topic again on April 20.
The agreement requires China to purchase $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services over two years — not $250 billion a year, as Trump has implied. For example, China agreed in 2020 to purchase $76.7 billion above the $186 billion that it purchased in goods and services in calendar year 2017. (The pre-trade war year of 2017 serves as the base year for both 2020 and 2021, the years covered by the two-year trade pact.)
So, when Trump says, ""China is going to have to buy $250 billion a year on our product,"" much of those purchases would have been expected with or without an agreement, based on past trade purchases.
As for U.S. agricultural products, Trump falsely said that the ""most they ever spent was 15 to 16"" billion a year. As we’ve written before, the most China has purchased in U.S. agricultural products was nearly $26 billion in 2012. 
Trump is also wrong when he says that under the new trade deal China will purchase ""up to $50 billion"" in U.S. agricultural products.
Under the deal, China agreed to increase agricultural purchases by $12.5 billion this year and $19.5 billion next year above the 2017 level, which according to the Department of Agriculture was $19.6 billion. That means total agricultural exports to China in 2020 and 2021 won’t add up to $50 billion a year, Chad E. Hart, an associate professor of economics and crop markets specialist at Iowa State University, told us in a phone interview in January.
""The document says $12.5 billion this year and $19.5 billion next year, and that would put [agricultural exports] at $32 billion this year and $39 billion next year,"" Hart told us. 
See ""Trump Exaggerates China Trade Impact on Farmers"" and ""Trump Wrong on U.S. Agriculture Exports to China.""
World Trade Organization. Trump continued to wrongly claim that before he became president the U.S. ""rarely, if ever"" won lawsuits within the World Trade Organization, but that because of his advocacy, the U.S. is now ""winning a lot"" of cases.
On April 14, Trump said, ""We’re now winning cases for the first time, because they know I’ll leave if we don’t get treated fairly. This country — our country — was at a point where we rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization. But now we’re winning a lot of them, because they know I’m not — I’m not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a 7-billion-dollar lawsuit, which was very nice.""
The following day, he similarly claimed, ""We’re winning a lot of lawsuits right now that we never won before in the past.""
But as we have written repeatedly, the U.S. has historically won the vast majority of cases it brings, and has lost most of the cases brought against it. That’s generally how other countries fare before the WTO as well, as countries typically only bring lawsuits they are likely win.
""Generally speaking, the US success rate at the WTO is about the same now as it was pre-Trump,"" Simon Lester, a trade policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, told us for an October article.
As for Trump’s reference to the U.S. recently winning ""a 7-billion-dollar lawsuit,"" he’s referring to the WTO announcement on Oct. 14 that it was authorizing the U.S. to impose tariffs of up to $7.5 billion a year on European Union goods and services because the EU had failed to remove subsidies for the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus that were inconsistent with a trade agreement and harmed Airbus’ U.S. rival, Boeing. But a string of WTO decisions since 2011 had already established that the subsidies broke trade rules, and trade experts said the award would likely have come down as it did no matter who was president.
See ""Flurry of Trump Falsehoods"" and ""Trump Wrong About WTO Record.""
South Korea Defense Costs. Trump gave himself too much credit when he said on April 20 that he ""went to"" South Korea last year ""and now they’re paying a billion dollars a year"" for the shared cost of the U.S. military presence in South Korea.
The Trump administration negotiated a one-year Special Measures Agreement for 2019 that saw South Korea increase its contribution to 1.039 trillion Korean won, up 8.2% from what South Korea paid in 2018 under a previous five-year deal approved in 2014. But the State Department said South Korea was already paying ""approximately $830 million per year"" under the five-year deal that expired in 2018.
Also, the one-year deal for 2019 has now expired, and the U.S. and South Korea have not yet agreed on a cost-sharing deal for future payments.

		Quick Take
The Trump administration has proposed a plan to provide direct payments to some U.S. citizens, beginning April 6, to blunt the economic impact of the coronavirus. But a prank post circulating on Facebook falsely states that the government is sending out checks every week and claim forms are already available.

Full Story 
The Trump administration recently announced plans for a $1 trillion emergency stimulus package to alleviate economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic. According to a proposal by the Treasury Department, the funding includes loans to airlines and small businesses as well as direct payments to individuals.
The proposal states that the individual payments would come in two rounds, with a total of ""$250 billion to be issued beginning April 6"" and ""$250 billion to be issued beginning May 18."" Each payment to individuals ""would be fixed and tiered based on income level and family size.""
On March 19, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said adults would initially receive $1,000 and children $500 within three weeks, and a second payment of the same amount in six weeks if the economic disruption continues.
Details about these payments have not been finalized, and legislation still needs to be drafted and approved by Congress.
But a series of viral Facebook posts wrongly claim that the government is sending out hundreds of dollars per week to each U.S. citizen ""starting from"" either March 16 or March 17, depending on the post.
""All US Citizens are Entitled to $700 USD per week to stay at home to avoid the spread of COVID-19 novel Coronavirus, starting from March 17, 2020,"" states one post, which has garnered more than 5,000 shares. ""The Government grant pay is accessible to all no matter employment status."" 
The post, accompanied by a ""BREAKING NEWS"" visual, includes a link that supposedly allows people to ""claim"" their money. The link leads to a photo of a gorilla with its middle finger up — revealing that the post is a joke. The same picture was used as a prank in another series of misleading posts about workplace and school closings due to the coronavirus, which we reported in early March.
Many commenters understood that the recent posts weren’t accurate. But with the Trump administration’s proposal to give out direct payments in the future, it’s important to sort fact from fiction.
The Treasury Department proposal states that there will be two payments, not weekly checks, starting on April 6 and May 18. It does not detail how much money each individual will receive, stating only that the amount will be determined in part by ""income level and family size.""
In a March 19 interview on ""Mornings with Maria"" on Fox Business, Mnuchin did provide dollar amounts for each of those payments — up to $1,000 for adults and $500 per child — but that is subject to negotiations with Congress before it can become law.
A day earlier, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech that ""a single $1,000 check"" isn’t enough.
Update, April 1: The president signed the $2 trillion stimulus package into law on March 27. Adults with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will receive $1,200 (married couples with an adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less will receive $2,400, plus $500 per child). The payment amount will scale down by income, phasing out at $99,000 for single individuals and $198,000 for couples without children.

		Coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas and Sen. Rand Paul have misleadingly suggested that much of the U.S. population has immunity to the coronavirus due to previous exposure to similar viruses. But scientists say any possible protection is theoretical — and can’t be relied upon to control the pandemic.
Paul, who is a Republican from Kentucky, broached the idea of preexisting immunity to the coronavirus during a Senate hearing on Sept. 23. 
In a heated exchange with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Paul argued that the reason why New York’s outbreak is now largely under control is because of community, or herd, immunity — and not because the population followed public health guidelines.
Fauci, Sept. 23: Right now, if you look at what’s going on right now, the things that are going on in New York to get their test positivity 1% or less is because they are looking at the guidelines that we have put together from the task force of the four or five things of masks, social distancing, outdoors more than indoors, avoiding crowds and washing hands.
Paul: Or they’ve developed enough community immunity that they’re no longer having the pandemic because they have enough immunity in New York City to actually stop it.
Fauci: I challenge that, senator. … You were not listening to what the director of the CDC said, that in New York, it’s about 22%. If you believe 22% is herd immunity, I believe you’re alone in that.
Paul: There’s also the preexisting immunity of those who have cross-reactivity, which is about a third of the public in many estimates … which would actually get you to about two-thirds.
Fauci: I’d like to talk to you about that also because there was a study that recently came out that preexisting immunity to coronaviruses that are common cold do not cross-react with the COVID-19.
It’s unclear which study Fauci was thinking of — NIAID’s press office did not respond to our inquiry — but Paul’s office told us he was referencing research on immune cells known as T cells from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.
As we’ll explain, there are studies showing that some people have T cells that can recognize SARS-CoV-2, or the novel coronavirus. But there’s no reason to think those cells would contribute to herd immunity, which occurs when enough of the population is immune to prevent spread of the disease.


Scientists have generally found that people do not harbor cross-reactive antibodies that can actually prevent infection with the coronavirus and that would be meaningful for herd immunity.
Although scientists are still debating what the herd immunity threshold is, most epidemiologists estimate that between 40% to 70% of a population would need to be vaccinated or have prior exposure to the virus for an outbreak to begin to die out.
Later that day, Atlas, the newest member of the coronavirus task force and a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, also brought up preexisting immunity in a press briefing at the White House.
When asked about Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield’s testimony, in which he said preliminary CDC antibody testing results showed that ""more than 90% of the population remains susceptible"" to COVID-19, Atlas said Redfield had ""misstated"" the findings.
Atlas, Sept. 23: The data on the susceptible that he was talking about was his surveillance data that showed that roughly 9% of the country has antibodies. But when you look at the CDC data state by state, much of that data is old. Some of it goes back to March or April, before many of these states had the cases. That’s point number one.
Point number two is that the immunity to the infection is not solely determined by the percent of people who have antibodies. If you look at the research — and there’s been about 24 papers at least on the immunity from T-cells — that’s a different type of immunity than antibodies. And without being boring, the reality is that — according to the papers from Sweden, Singapore and elsewhere — there is cross-immunity, highly likely from other infections, and there is also T-cell immunity. And the combination of those makes the antibodies a small fraction of the people that have immunity.
So the answer is no, it is not 90% of people that are susceptible to the infection.
A neuroradiologist who researches health policy, Atlas wasn’t trained as an immunologist, infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist. He has reportedly backed a ""herd immunity"" approach to the pandemic, although he denies embracing such a strategy.
Both Redfield and Fauci have expressed concerns about Atlas and the accuracy of the information he imparts to the president and the public, although Atlas maintains that he is following the science.
In a phone call on a commercial airline, Redfield was overheard saying, ""Everything he says is false,"" according to an NBC News report. A federal official similarly told CNN that the CDC head was worried that Atlas was providing Trump with misleading information.
When asked in a Sept. 28 CNN interview whether Atlas was misleading the president, Fauci replied, ""Well, yeah, I’m concerned that sometimes things are said that are really taken either out of context or actually incorrect.""
Cross-Reactive T Cells
Paul and Atlas reference studies that suggest a good chunk of people have T cells in their bodies that ""cross-react"" with SARS-CoV-2, even though they’ve never been exposed to the virus before.
These studies do indeed exist — but both men inaccurately conclude that people with cross-reactive T cells will be protected from becoming infected with the virus, when that’s almost certainly not the case.
A paper published in May by researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in the journal Cell, for example, found that about half of the 11 tested blood samples from unexposed donors contained T cells that could recognize SARS-CoV-2.
All of the control volunteers had donated blood between 2015 and 2018, so it wasn’t possible for them to have developed those T cells as a result of an infection with the novel coronavirus. But all of them did have antibodies to at least one of two human common cold coronaviruses, suggesting that these were so-called memory T cells generated as a result of past cold infections.
A follow-up study published in the journal Science by many of the same scientists further supported the idea that the responding T cells were primarily memory cells, present in the body because of past human cold coronavirus infections.
Other studies have found similar results, typically finding between 20% and 50% of the samples from people who were never exposed to the coronavirus nevertheless have T cells that can recognize the pathogen.
But immunologists don’t yet know what it means for a person to have these preexisting T cells. 
Shane Crotty, a professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and an author of the Cell and Science papers, explained in an Aug. 11 Twitter thread that T cells might be helpful to some people but are unlikely to contribute to herd immunity.
""We SPECULATE that it is conceivable that these T cells may potentially reduce COVID-19 disease severity, based on things we know about flu and T cells,"" he said, emphasizing that there was no data to support this, as it is only a hypothesis, but it was important to keep investigating to find out.
""[E]ven if our most optimistic speculations about crossreactive T cell memory were found to be correct, it would mean that just as many people would get infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fewer would become severely ill and die from COVID-19,"" he added. ""T cells generally don’t completely prevent infections, they limit disease (make it shorter and/or less serious).""
Crotty also responded on Twitter to Atlas’ Sept. 23 comments at the White House, noting that ""several major aspects"" of what he said ""are wrong.""
""There is no direct evidence that pre-existing T cell immunity affects COVID-19 infections,"" he said, noting that he and other researchers ""have proven that such T cells exist, but neither we nor anyone else have shown that the pre-existing T cells make COVID-19 better, worse, or no difference.""
""[W]e only SPECULATE that they may impact COVID-19 disease,"" he added. ""Even IF such a pre-existing T cell immunity exists, it would almost certainly not affect herd immunity.""
Previously, Crotty’s institution also batted down claims about being close to COVID-19 herd immunity. ""While many people have T cells that can recognize #SARSCOV2,"" the La Jolla Institute wrote in a tweet, ""this does not mean they are immune or can’t pass on the disease.""
Other experts agree. 
""There is evidence that people vary in the amount of T cell immunity that they have to SARS-CoV-2 and that this plausibly reflects exposure to other betacoronaviruses over the life course,"" said Harvard epidemiologist Bill Hanage in a press call, referring to the sub-group of coronaviruses to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs.
""However, the nature of the immune system is such that it’s by no means obvious what this actually means,"" he said. ""It could lead to more severe illness, it can lead to milder illness, and so on and so forth.""
Indeed, while the preliminary evidence does not suggest that the cross-reactive T cells are harmful in this case, it is a possibility. Crotty and his La Jolla colleague Alessandro Sette explained in a scientific review that preexisting immunity can sometimes be detrimental, either by making the immune response weaker than it otherwise would have been, or by having the immune system enhance disease.
""Any appeal to existing immunity,"" Hanage added, ""has to handle the fact that even in places … where we’re still doing relatively large amounts of physical distancing and mask use, infection proceeds at a sort of steady pace, which does indicate that if you’d provide the opportunity for it to transmit more, it will.""
""Any reliance upon existing immunity from other betacoronaviruses, unfortunately, is wishful thinking,"" he said.
Crotty and Sette also teamed up with public health scientists from Harvard to think through the ramifications of preexisting T cell immunity for the COVID-19 pandemic. Writing in Nature Reviews Immunology on Oct. 6, the group outlined several scenarios for how cross-reactive T cells might function in individuals and at a population level.
In the most plausible scenarios, the T cells help reduce severity of COVID-19, and in some cases might reduce the spread of the virus, although there is also a chance of increasing spread if the reduced symptoms made the infection harder to identify. But, as the authors write, potential for reduced transmission is already accounted for in models of disease spread since it’s based on real-world data. And again, and because this type of immunity doesn’t prevent infection, it is ""not expected to ‘supplement’ herd immunity.""
The researchers did examine a scenario in which herd immunity would be affected, but explain that it is ""highly unlikely"" and would be immunologically ""unprecedented."" In this scenario, the preexisting T cells in the upper respiratory tract would have to quickly block viral replication of the virus, eliminating all the infected cells within a day. This is the closest T cell immunity could get to the ""sterilizing immunity"" of neutralizing antibodies, which can intervene before any cells are infected.
All the evidence, however, indicates not only that this has never happened before in humans, but also that it doesn’t appear to be happening with COVID-19. This kind of T cell ""blitz"" has been reported only in animal models with other diseases and with a different type of T cell than what most people have from past coronavirus infections. 
Such a T cell response also has not been observed in past experiments with the cold coronaviruses, the authors write, ""making it implausible"" that cross-reactive T cells alone could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, the epidemiology also fails to fit with such a scenario, as outbreaks on ships report high levels of viral spread.
""In sum,"" the authors write of the plausible scenarios, ""the discovery of cross-reactive T cells should not substantially change projections of disease dynamics in populations or, specifically, of the proportion of the population who will become infected before transmission wanes.""
Understanding Seroprevalence
Atlas’ other claim was that Redfield was wrong when he said 90% of the American public remains susceptible to the coronavirus. While there are always caveats to the data, there is no reason to think that Redfield’s estimate, which stems from a CDC seroprevalence study, is wildly off. Such studies estimate how much of the population has developed antibodies using antibody tests.
In fact, another study published in the journal The Lancet two days after Redfield’s testimony also backs a similar figure. That study, performed by researchers at Stanford, found that 9% of people from a nationwide survey of dialysis patients had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Atlas said that one reason the estimate of susceptible people was so high is that the data was old — from March or April. But other CDC data, which are derived from commercial lab surveys, indicate that about 6% of the American population has antibodies to the coronavirus as of early August. And the Stanford study also used more recent data, from July.
As the Stanford authors explain in their article, their estimate based on dialysis patients might overestimate the number of people in the general population exposed to the virus, since many dialysis patients are minorities. Or, it could underestimate the total, perhaps because the dialysis patients are less likely to be working and may be more protected than others. But it’s in line with other seroprevalence surveys, which have concluded that the vast majority of people have not been infected and are unlikely to be immune. 
""In fact, even if the seroprevalence estimates derived from the US dialysis population overestimated true seroprevalence in the overall US adult population, our data nonetheless support that fewer than 10% of the US population has seroconverted as of July, 2020, and herd immunity remains out of reach,"" the authors wrote.
Although Atlas argues the percentage of susceptible people should be much lower because of T cell immunity, as we’ve already established, T cell immunity is unlikely to contribute to herd immunity and should not be counted toward the total unless new evidence arises suggesting that it does play a role.
Dr. Julie Parsonnet, an infectious disease specialist and co-author of the Stanford antibody study, told us that the overall consensus is that 9%, with or without T cells contributing, is ""very unlikely"" to represent herd immunity.
She emphasized that the virus can be brought under control without reaching herd immunity, but that involves using the public health strategies that have been shown to work. ""They didn’t need T cells in New Zealand or Taiwan,"" she said.
Former CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden also objected to the idea that far more Americans are already immune. ""Only at most 1 in 7 Americans have been infected with Covid. That means 6 in 7 are likely still vulnerable,"" he said in a Sept. 30 tweet. ""The US is nowhere close to herd immunity and anyone suggesting otherwise doesn’t know enough about epidemiology and public health.""

		Q: Does vitamin D help protect against COVID-19?
A: Some scientists have hypothesized vitamin D might be helpful, but there is no direct evidence that vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 or lessen disease severity. Nevertheless, it should be part of a healthy lifestyle.

FULL QUESTION
Could vitamin D help decrease the chance of covid 19?
FULL ANSWER
As the coronavirus has spread around the globe, some scientists have proposed that vitamin D could help with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. 
Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden, for example, published a March 23 column on Fox News’ website suggesting that vitamin D could reduce a person’s COVID-19 risk.
""There are many crackpot claims about miracle cures floating around,"" he wrote, ""but the science supports the possibility – although not the proof – that Vitamin D may strengthen the immune system, particularly of people whose Vitamin D levels are low.""
The idea stems in part from experiments that have found that the vitamin, which is synthesized in the skin after sun exposure and is found in select foods, is used by the immune system. Some research also suggests vitamin D supplements might protect against respiratory infections, especially if someone is deficient in the vitamin. And many of the people most affected by the coronavirus, such as the elderly and minority populations, tend to have lower vitamin D levels.
But experts caution against overinterpreting preliminary correlations or hypothetical mechanisms. As Pennsylvania State University nutrition researcher A. Catharine Ross told us, associations are not the same as cause and effect, and the evidence either for or against vitamin D and COVID-19 is ""extremely weak.""
A rapid review from Oxford University’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found ""no clinical evidence"" that vitamin D could prevent or treat COVID-19, and another review on the topic published by nearly two dozen nutrition experts in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health recommended avoiding vitamin D deficiency, but warned against taking high doses of the vitamin.
""As a key micronutrient,"" the authors wrote, ""vitamin D should be given particular focus—not as a ‘magic bullet’ to beat COVID-19, as the scientific evidence base is severely lacking at this time—but rather as part of a healthy lifestyle strategy to ensure that populations are nutritionally in the best possible place.""
Thus, while it’s a good idea to get enough vitamin D — pandemic or not — it’s too early to say that a lack of vitamin D makes COVID-19 worse, or that supplementing with vitamin D provides any protection against the disease. 
Vitamin D Basics
Although called a vitamin, vitamin D acts as a hormone in the body, and is best known for building strong bones, which is done in large part by promoting absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestine.
""It’s actually a prohormone, and of all the nutrients that we have, it’s the only nutrient where the main source is not diet,"" said Susan Lanham-New, a vitamin D researcher at the University of Surrey in the U.K.
Instead, she told us, most of a person’s vitamin D is made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, which is why darker-skinned people are more likely to have lower levels of the vitamin, and why people who go outside less frequently, including those who are older or less healthy, are susceptible to deficiencies.
For vitamin D to be used by the body, it must be converted into an active form, typically by the liver and kidney, according to a National Institutes of Health fact sheet. The nutrient is found naturally in only a few foods, such as eggs and oily fish, but is more widely available in the U.S. in food that has been fortified, including milk and cereals.
While there is a debate about exactly how much vitamin D a person needs, and what constitutes a deficiency, Lanham-New said a commonly used metric for deficiency is a blood level below 25-30 nanomoles per liter. Too little vitamin D can lead to rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults — conditions in which bones become soft and deformed. 
More is not always better, however, since vitamin D is fat-soluble, and is stored in the body. ""You can get what we call hypercalcemia if you take too much vitamin D,"" Lanham-New said, referring to elevated levels of calcium in the blood that can be especially dangerous for those with kidney diseases.
Vitamin D and Immunity
Beyond its role in bone health, vitamin D is also known to function in the immune system, which is a key reason why some think it’s plausible the nutrient might impact COVID-19.
Lanham-New, for example, said that vitamin D receptors are present on immune cells, and some immune cells make enzymes that help convert the nutrient into an active form.
""That very much provides the scientific rationale for the potential role of vitamin D in maintaining"" the immune system, she said.
Some experiments in cultured cells have shown that vitamin D can trigger the production of antimicrobial peptides, including in lung cells, that might act to fight off invading pathogens.
Other lab experiments have found vitamin D might act to tamp down overactive immune responses by tilting those responses toward less inflammatory ones, including by reducing the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, or signaling proteins. 
Some researchers have hypothesized that this mechanism might be relevant to the coronavirus, since some COVID-19 patients experience life-threatening surges of cytokines known as cytokine storms that can damage organs as immune cells rush into the lungs to clear the virus from the body.
But while a lot of basic research points to vitamin D having a role in the immune system, it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice. Studies assessing whether vitamin D can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally been inconsistent.
There is some evidence that vitamin D can protect against respiratory tract infections. In 2017, researchers at Queen Mary University of London published a meta-analysis in the journal BMJ that pooled individual patient data from 25 randomized controlled trials testing vitamin D supplementation in a variety of illnesses, including influenza, pneumonia, colds and ear infections. 
The authors identified a protective effect for those taking vitamin D supplements daily or weekly, with the greatest benefit going to those who had the lowest levels of the vitamin to start. Periodic large doses, or boluses, of vitamin D were not effective.
An accompanying editorial, however, noted that the absolute risk of coming down with at least one respiratory infection when taking vitamin D supplements dropped by only 2 percentage points — from 42% to 40% — and that given differences between the studies that were analyzed, large randomized controlled trials were still needed.
Lack of Evidence for Vitamin D and COVID-19
Because the coronavirus is so new, little rigorous research has been done specifically on vitamin D and COVID-19.
Oxford’s rapid review, which was posted last month and reflected literature searches performed in April, did not identify any clinical evidence that vitamin D is beneficial for COVID-19. The report concluded that ""well-masked randomized trials"" were needed before specifically recommending the nutrient for COVID-19, but that Britons should already be taking vitamin D supplements anyway, per national guidance. 
Since then, a variety of published and unpublished studies investigating potential links between vitamin D and COVID-19 have appeared, but Dr. Joseph Lee, a general practitioner and co-author of the report, told us that he was not aware of any subsequent studies that would alter his group’s recommendation that ""people should take vitamin D, but not because of COVID-19.""
Lanham-New, who was the lead author of the BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health review, also said her conclusions had not changed.
One U.K. study, published on May 6 in Aging Clinical and Experimental Research, identified a crude association between the average vitamin D level reported in 20 European countries and the number of per-capita COVID-19 cases and deaths in those nations. 
Another similar paper, appearing in the Irish Medical Journal, found an inverse relationship between the vitamin D levels in older people in different European countries, as reported in past studies, and a country’s COVID-19 mortality rate, with fish-loving Nordic countries generally faring better than those in southern Europe.
But these so-called ecological epidemiology studies can only hint at any effect of vitamin D, since they’re simple correlations at the population level. ""This is not a design suited to identifying causal effects,"" Lee said, ""and I would not consider them as evidence of a role for vitamin D in COVID-19.""
Other reports also claim to identify links between lower levels of vitamin D and COVID-19 infection or disease severity in different cohorts of people, but most of these have not yet been vetted by other scientists through peer review. 
One unpublished report of 780 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia found that the majority of deaths occurred in patients with abnormally low vitamin D blood levels, and claimed to have found an association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 mortality after controlling for other factors, such as other preexisting health conditions.
But as Lanham-New noted in an interview, the paper ""doesn’t in any way prove cause and effect."" Lee, too, said that while the authors attempted to control for other health conditions, the group did so in an odd way, lumping all of the conditions together. And even if the team had controlled for them individually, that doesn’t necessarily eliminate bias, so the relationship could reflect the fact that people who are in poorer health generally fare worse with COVID-19.
""It is relatively easy to calculate associations, and that is what most of these papers have done,"" Penn State’s Ross said. ""But associations do not show cause and effect, and in fact, ‘reverse causation’ is not carefully considered."" The disease itself could cause a reduction in a person’s vitamin D levels, she said, noting that there are negative associations of serum vitamin D with diabetes, obesity and other infections. ""I place little confidence on any of these studies,"" she said.
More credible, Ross said, were two analyses of U.K. biobank data, neither of which support the idea that less vitamin D leads to a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Given concerns that the disproportionate number of coronavirus infections in blacks and South Asians in the U.K. could be due to lower vitamin D levels in darker-skinned people, the researchers checked to see if there was any connection between a person’s vitamin D levels, which had been measured in participants about a decade ago, and testing positive for COVID-19.
While the published report affirmed that black and South Asian participants were several times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than whites, there was no association with vitamin D. The authors concluded that vitamin D ""is unlikely to be the underlying mechanism for the higher risk observed in black and minority ethnic individuals and vitamin D supplements are unlikely to provide an effective intervention.""
The other analysis, which Lanham-New said has since been submitted to a journal with additional participant data, found no difference in vitamin D status among those who tested positive versus negative for COVID-19. She said additional work was planned once COVID-19 severity and mortality data became available.
Another consideration when interpreting many observational studies, Lee said, is something called collider bias, which can sometimes result in spurious correlations when the people included in a dataset aren’t representative of the wider population. Some researchers have already noted that COVID-19 studies may be especially prone to collider bias, making it hard to identify risk factors and medications that work.
Consider a study analyzing outcomes among people who are tested for COVID-19. Some people are likely getting tested because they are quite ill and have been admitted to the hospital, while others may be tested because they’re a health care worker or because they’re more privileged and have access to testing.
In this scenario, Lee said, people with good levels of vitamin D will be less likely to test positive, compared to the sick people. ""This selection will in itself induce an association between low vitamin D and COVID-19 positive tests or severity of disease,"" he said, ""even if it isn’t true in the general population.""
Recommendations
In the end, Ross is skeptical that vitamin D will prove to be beneficial for COVID-19, although she hesitated to entirely discount the possibility, given how much is still unknown about the disease.
""[I]t is hard for me to conceive that vitamin D has much chance of being as effective as other kinds of treatments, if at all,"" she said. ""We don’t know however.""
Several randomized controlled trials are in the works, which may reveal a more concrete answer.
Her recommendation, irrespective of COVID-19, is to consume vitamin D-rich foods or take a supplement to provide the recommended dietary amount, or RDA, of 600-800 International Units per day. This matches the Institute of Medicine’s national guideline, which Ross helped write, and which assumes minimal sun exposure.
One cup of fortified milk, for example, contains 120 IUs of vitamin D, while a 3-ounce serving of cooked salmon provides 570 IUs.
Lanham-New emphasized that excessive doses of vitamin D should not be used. But especially for those who have been cooped up indoors while social distancing, it may be a good idea to take regular supplements. 
""If you’re in self-isolation, definitely be taking a vitamin D supplement according to your government guidelines,"" she said. 
Lee also pointed to following state or national vitamin D recommendations. ""There is no reason to think it will help with COVID-19, but that might change when the trials report,"" he said of vitamin D. ""Our advice is to take vitamin D in accordance with local guidelines.""

		Quick Take
Social media posts falsely suggest that news outlets are misusing a boy’s image to report the same child died of COVID-19 in three different countries. The posts actually refer to three different young people who died from the novel coronavirus in Portugal, Belgium and the UK.

Full Story
Older adults are at a significantly increased risk from the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization has reported. But age is not the only factor in the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Dr. Hans Henri Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe. 
""The very notion that ‘COVID-19 only affects older people’ is factually wrong,"" Kluge has stated. ""As a colleague of mine recently said, ‘Young people are not invincible.'""
Kluge added: ""Severe cases of the disease have been seen in people in their teens or twenties, with many requiring intensive care and some unfortunately passing away.""
In fact, cases of young people becoming ill or dying from COVID-19 have been reported around the world. But posts circulating on social media falsely imply that news media have been misusing the image of one young COVID-19 victim, reporting his death in different countries across Europe.
One Facebook post features side-by-side screenshots of three purported articles that allegedly use the same image of a young boy to report that a child had died from COVID-19 in the UK, Portugal and Belgium. The post reads, ""CHILD DIES IN 3 COUNTRIES OF CORONA VIRUS."" Similar claims involving the same child’s photo have also appeared on Twitter.
The content of the post, which has been widely shared across social media, is misleading on several points.
The child pictured in the post is Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a Portuguese boy who died at age 14 after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. Record, a Portuguese newspaper, first wrote about Godinho’s passing on March 29. Other media outlets quickly followed suit, publishing stories about Godinho’s death alongside images of the child, including the photo used in the social media posts. Godinho is correctly identified in the screenshot from the Daily Mail (center) in the Facebook post. 
The social media post implies that news outlets then used Godinho’s image to report the death of a 12-year-old girl in Belgium on March 31. The Facebook post includes screenshots of an internet search result showing a Daily Express article featuring Godinho’s image with the caption, ""Belgium coronavirus: 12-year old girl dies of coronavirus…""
Indeed, the Daily Express article does use Godinho’s image, but not to depict the unnamed 12-year-old girl who had died. Rather, Godinho’s photo was included in the story in reference to other young people who had died of COVID-19 in Europe, and it accurately identifies the photo as that of Godinho.
Prior to the passing of the unnamed Belgian girl, Godinho was believed to be ""Europe’s youngest coronavirus victim."" There are no pictures of the Belgian girl in the Daily Express article or any other article we were able to find.
The social media post also claims that Godinho’s image is being used in the news report of a 13-year-old boy in the UK, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died from the coronavirus. The post includes a screenshot of what appears to be an article in the Daily Record, a Scottish newspaper, with the headline, ""Schoolboy, 13, with no health conditions becomes UK’s youngest coronavirus victim.""
Abdulwahab’s death on March 30 has been widely reported. Madinah College, an Islamic sciences school where Ismail’s sister is a teacher, set up a GoFundMe to raise money for Abdulwahab’s funeral and family. A photo of Abdulwahab does not appear in coverage of his death and funeral. There is no photo of any child with the Daily Record story. It is unclear where the incorrect combination of Godinho’s image and Abdulwahab’s name originated.
So, social media posts do reference the deaths of three young people from COVID-19 in Europe. But the posts do not show that news outlets misused the same image of one boy to report the deaths of three children.

      Walmart Hasn’t Adopted ‘Staggered Shopping’ Based on Age

		Quick Take
A viral post circulating on Facebook falsely claims that Walmart, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, has instituted a ""staggered shopping schedule"" that allows only certain age groups on specific days. The store has started a weekly ""senior shopping event,"" but no other restrictions based on age.

Full Story
As the novel coronavirus spreads across the U.S., governments and public health experts are cautioning people to stay home, go out only when necessary, and keep a safe distance from other people to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Some retail companies are adopting procedures to help deal with the crisis by limiting the number of shoppers in a store at one time and protecting at-risk patrons.
But a viral post on Facebook falsely purports to be an announcement from Walmart, one of the largest retail chains, that a new policy has been instituted allowing only certain age groups to shop on specific days of the week.
""Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective immediately Walmart is adopting a staggered shopping schedule as follows,"" reads the post, which has been shared extensively on Facebook and bears the logos of Walmart and its members-only Sam’s Club. ""We apologize for any inconeince: Monday Age 66+, Tuesday 56-65, Wednesday 46-55, Thursday 36-45, Friday 25-35, Saturday 24 and below, Sunday shopping emergency only""
The misspelling of ""inconvenience"" is a hint that this announcement came from an unreliable source.
Rebecca Thomason, a Walmart corporate communications senior manager, told us in an email that the information presented in the viral posts is ""completely false.""
Walmart has changed the hours at many of its stores, which are now open from 7 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Some stores were previously open 24 hours or until midnight, although closing times vary by location. In a March 18 press release, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Walmart U.S., Dacona Smith, said: ""This will further help associates restock the shelves for customers while continuing to clean and sanitize the store."" 
In addition, Smith said in the press release, ""We know our older customers could be more vulnerable to the coronavirus and to better support them, Walmart is offering special shopping hours. From March 24 through April 28, Walmart stores will host an hour-long senior shopping event every Tuesday for customers aged 60 and older. This will start one hour before the store opens.""
Walmart also has launched a policy that reduces crowding during the pandemic. In an April 3 press release, Smith announced: ""[W]e will limit the number of customers who can be in a store at once. Stores will now allow no more than five customers for each 1,000 square feet at a given time, roughly 20 percent of a store’s capacity."" 
Thomason, the Walmart communications senior manager, said the company is implementing other protocols to protect its customers and associates.  The company is encouraging people to socially distance while in stores, aided by signs and floor decals. It is installing sneeze guards at pharmacy lanes and checkout, and prohibiting employees with fever or other symptoms — determined by a temperature check and questionnaire — from working.

      FactChecking Biden’s Town Hall

		At a televised town hall in Philadelphia, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made false and misleading claims on COVID-19, health insurance, the 1994 crime bill and more:

Biden falsely claimed all members of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team in China ""came home"" before the coronavirus pandemic. The staff was cut, but not eliminated.
He claimed the Trump administration stopped providing masks for schools. One agency did stop, but another intends to distribute up to 125 million masks for schools.
Biden claimed he opposed giving states more money for prison systems in 1994. He supported $6 billion in funding, just not the $10 billion that was in the final crime bill.
The former vice president cited an estimate that 10 million would lose employer-sponsored insurance during the pandemic, but didn’t mention most would regain other coverage.
Biden left the false impression that 100 million people with preexisting conditions could lose insurance if the ACA were repealed. Those with employer plans couldn’t be denied policies.
We couldn’t find support for Biden’s claim that ""the boilermakers overwhelmingly endorse me."" The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers hasn’t endorsed a candidate.
Biden wrongly said that the Green New Deal would require the U.S. ""to be carbon free"" by 2030, but the resolution’s goal is less stringent than that.

The town hall, which aired on ABC, was held in place of the second presidential debate, which was canceled after President Donald Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate. The debate commission decided to switch to a virtual debate after Trump contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized for three days, leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Oct. 5.
At the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Biden fielded questions from socially distanced audience members and moderator George Stephanopoulos. The topics included COVID-19, Trump’s tax cuts, race relations, the Supreme Court, LGBTQ rights, health insurance, restoring bipartisanship, fracking, foreign affairs and the crime bill that Biden sponsored in 1994.
Meanwhile, the president was on NBC News for a one-hour town hall, which we also fact-checked.
CDC Staff Cuts
Biden falsely claimed the Trump administration recalled all the members of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team in China.
""All the way back in the beginning of February, I argued that we should be keeping people in China,"" Biden said. ""And we had set up in our administration a pandemic office within the White House. There were 44 people on the ground [in China]. I suggested that we should be seeking … to have access to the source of the problem. And to the best of our knowledge, Trump never pushed that. All those 44 people came home, never got replaced.""
As we’ve written before, Biden was referring to a March 25 Reuters report that said the Trump administration had reduced the CDC’s staff in China. But the whole team didn’t come home, as Biden said.
That story, citing CDC documents, said CDC’s Beijing office ""has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.""
Reuters said the majority of the CDC staffers let go were actually Chinese nationals on the U.S. payroll. There were only eight Americans assigned to the CDC’s Beijing office, and five of them were cut at the start of the Trump administration. A fourth American, a deputy director, was later added.
FEMA and Face Masks
Biden misleadingly said: ""The government initially said they were going to provide masks for every student and every teacher and then they said … the president or whomever said, ‘No, no. That’s not a national emergency.'""
In September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it would stop reimbursing states for the costs of masks for schools, but the Department of Health and Human Services said it would provide up to 125 million cloth masks for schools.
NPR reported on Sept. 1 that Keith Turi, FEMA assistant administrator for recovery, told state and tribal emergency managers that FEMA would stop on Sept. 15 reimbursing states for cloth masks and other personal protective equipment for places, such as schools, that are deemed nonemergency locations.
""The changes narrow what constitutes an ’emergency protective measure’ and is thus eligible for FEMA’s Public Assistance Program,"" according to NPR, which obtained a recording of the call.
But another federal program will still provide masks to schools. HHS’ Public Health Emergency webpage says: ""The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be providing up to 125 million cloth masks to states for distribution to schools. The Administration intends for these masks to support students, teachers, and staff in public and private schools reopening, with an emphasis on students who are low-income or otherwise with high needs and schools providing in-person instruction.""
NPR also noted that nothing prevented states from stockpiling such protective equipment before the FEMA policy went into effect.
1994 Crime Bill
When asked about the 1994 crime bill he had championed at the time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden said the bill contained ""both bad and good"" things, but he stretched the facts on at least one point.
""I wrote the Violence Against Women Act, that was part of it. Assault weapons ban and other things that were good,"" he said. ""What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they could build – state prison systems.""
Biden did support $6 billion in funding for state prison construction, but not the $10 billion that was part of the final bill. When we wrote about a similar claim in July 2019, his campaign told us the $4 billion difference is what he meant when he said he didn’t support ""more money"" for state prisons.
The prison funding went to states that had ""truth-in-sentencing"" laws requiring that people convicted of violent crimes serve at least 85% of their sentences. According to the Department of Justice, 11 states adopted such laws in 1995 and three years later, 27 states and Washington, D.C., met the criteria for the prison construction grants.
This is one of the measures experts have cited in saying the 1994 legislation contributed to already increasing incarceration. ""Although incarceration was already rising steadily before the crime bill, several of its provisions helped increase incarceration even further,"" experts with the Brennan Center for Justice said in 2016.
The authors said: ""On their own, states passed three-strikes laws, enacted mandatory minimums, eliminated parole, and removed judicial discretion in sentencing. By dangling bonus dollars, the crime bill encouraged states to remain on their tough-on-crime course.""
In the town hall, Biden also said the crime legislation ""had three strikes and you’re out, which I voted against in the crime bill.""
We found there’s evidence supporting Biden’s claim that he didn’t back the final legislation’s three-strikes provision, but he did vote in favor of one version, a Republican amendment that was added to the Senate legislation. Biden is on record at the time as saying he supported a three-strikes provision for ""serious [violent] felonies against a person,"" but he was against including nonviolent offenses and expressed concern that minor crimes could get swept up in the measure.
The provision in the final bill said anyone with at least two prior convictions for serious violent felonies, or one of those being a drug distribution or trafficking offense, who then committed a federal serious violent felony would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
One DOJ-funded research report published in 2000 found that, with the exception of California, the state and federal three-strikes laws had ""virtually no impact on the courts, local jails or state prisons."" The report said this type of legislation was ""carefully crafted to be largely symbolic,"" but also that courts and prosecutors had minimized the impact.
Health Insurance Claims
Biden gave a bleak assessment of what it would mean for millions of people if the Affordable Care Act — perhaps better known as Obamacare — were struck down.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in a case aimed at nullifying the ACA a week after the election, and the Trump administration has backed the suit.
""Ten million people have already lost their insurance from their employer and [Trump] wants to take 20 million out of system as well, plus 100 million people with preexisting conditions,"" Biden said, suggesting that would be the effect of ending the ACA.
But those numbers need some explanation.
The first figure — 10 million — is a reference to the number of people who are expected to lose their employer-based health insurance during the COVID-19 recession. The former vice president cited the same figure during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. It comes from an Urban Institute study — but that study also said that most would regain insurance from another source, leaving 3.5 million uninsured.
The study estimated that job losses would cause 10.1 million people to lose their health coverage from April through December. But many would switch to insurance through another family member, Medicaid or the individual market.
The 20 million figure reflects the number of people who had gained coverage by 2016 — two years after the major provisions of the ACA went into effect in 2014.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2017 that if the ACA were repealed and not replaced with new legislation, the uninsured would increase by 32 million over 10 years.
As we’ve written before, it’s unclear what a Republican replacement plan for the ACA might be. The president backed a 2017 GOP health care bill that would lead to 24 million more uninsured in 2026, according to an analysis by the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation.
So, projecting a loss of 20 million people from the insurance system if the ACA were dismantled may actually underestimate the potential effect.
The third figure — 100 million — is an estimate of the number of Americans, outside of Medicare and Medicaid, who have preexisting conditions. Without the ACA, they would lose the preexisting condition protections in that law, which prohibits insurers from denying coverage, charging more or excluding coverage of certain conditions based on health status. 
But, as we’ve written before, to be at risk of being denied insurance, they would have to seek coverage on the individual market, where those without employer or public insurance buy plans. Before the ACA, employer-based plans couldn’t deny insurance, but they could decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.
Only 6% of the population gets coverage on the individual market, while 49% have employer-based plans.
So, suggesting that 100 million people may be denied coverage due to preexisting conditions overstates the potential effect of doing away with the ACA.
Trump has said he would require insurers to cover preexisting conditions, but it’s unclear what those protections would be since the president hasn’t offered a health plan to replace the ACA. 
Boilermakers Endorsement?
When Stephanopoulos asked Biden about comments made by a member of a Pennsylvania boilermakers’ union who was skeptical of Biden’s claims that he won’t ban fracking, Biden responded by saying, ""Tell him the boilermakers overwhelmingly endorse me, OK.""
But it’s not clear which union(s) Biden was claiming has endorsed him.
Boilermakers Local 154, the Pittsburgh-based union Stephanopoulos mentioned, has endorsed Trump for president. And the website of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, which claims to represent 60,000 workers in the U.S. and Canada, says: ""The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers has not endorsed any U.S. Presidential candidate for the 2020 Election, and the information contained on this webpage in no way serves as an endorsement by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers for any U.S. Presidential candidate.""
Green New Deal
In attempting to distance his climate change plan from the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution introduced in 2019, Biden made confusing remarks about the latter.
""The difference between me and the New Green Deal, they say automatically, by 2030, we’re going to be carbon free, not possible,"" Biden said.
Actually, the Green New Deal — not the ""New Green Deal"" — doesn’t call for banning all fossil fuels or carbon emissions by 2030. As we’ve written before, its primary climate change goal is to reach net-zero greenhouse emissions in a decade. ""Net-zero"" means that after tallying up all the greenhouse gases that are released and subtracting those that are sequestered, or removed, there is no net addition to the atmosphere.
When Stephanopoulos pushed back on Biden’s criticism of the proposal and noted that Biden’s own website called the Green New Deal a ""crucial framework,"" Biden said, ""my deal is a crucial framework, but not the New Green Deal."" That’s not what his campaign website says.
""Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face,"" the website says. ""It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.""

		In the days leading up to President Donald Trump’s first campaign rally since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, Trump and his supporters are making false and misleading claims about COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and testing: 

In a tweet, Trump claimed that the U.S. testing program ""is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases."" Although the U.S. has completed the highest number of coronavirus tests, it still lags behind other nations in tests per capita, and a higher proportion of tests have also come back positive.
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow inaccurately said in a television interview that ""hospitalizations may be going up, but that’s because elective procedures are now permitted."" COVID-19 hospitalization figures, which are increasing in some locales, are limited to those with COVID-19 diagnoses.
Vice President Mike Pence, Trump and Kudlow all suggested that the uptick in COVID-19 cases seen in some states is driven by increases in testing. Testing accounts for some of the rise, but doesn’t explain all of it.
Oklahoma, the site of Trump’s rally, has seen an increase in the number of people who are ""currently hospitalized"" with confirmed cases of COVID-19, state data shows. But GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma falsely said of his state: ""We continue to see hospitalizations decline."" 
Similarly, Pence wrongly said that COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma have ""declined precipitously."" The state Health Department reports that ""Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases,"" reaching a new single-day high on June 16.

Trump is set to speak at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 20.
Trump’s Testing Tweet
In a June 15 tweet, Trump once again bragged about America’s ability to test for the coronavirus, leaving the misleading impression that better testing is responsible for the country’s large number of cases. 
""Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases,"" he said. ""Without testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases.""
Later in the day, Trump repeated the sentiment, saying in a roundtable at the White House, ""If you don’t test, you don’t have any cases. If we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any.""
To some extent he’s right — if there were less testing, then the reported number of cases would be lower, although of course those infections would still exist. 
But experts say Trump is wrong to claim that the U.S. is more advanced on testing ""than any other country.""
""The US may have done the most tests, but not the highest # of tests per capita. And our positivity is higher than many other countries,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on Twitter in response to the president’s tweet.
""In summary: we still haven’t done enough testing for the size of our epidemic, which is largest in world,"" she added.
As we have explained before, the total number of tests completed is not necessarily reflective of how well a country is meeting the challenge of diagnosing its COVID-19 patients. Typically, a superior indicator is tests per capita, which takes into account a country’s population. And even better is the test positivity rate, or the proportion of tests that are positive, which can show how much testing has been done relative to the size of an outbreak.
As of June 14 — the latest data available when Trump made his claim — the U.S. had completed just over 23.5 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project. 
That is the largest number of total tests performed by a single country, per statistics collected by Our World in Data. But it is not the top per-capita rate. On that metric, 16 other nations best the U.S., including Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Italy and Australia.
And with nearly 9% of all tests having come back positive, the U.S. is not even close to being in the vanguard for low test positivity: The U.S. ranks behind at least 50 other nations.
As we’ve mentioned before, there are limitations with the figures compiled by Our World in Data, since different countries report their testing statistics differently. So the numbers may not be directly comparable, but they are widely viewed as the best available international data on the subject.
A Johns Hopkins website that uses slightly different calculations based on daily averages — which Nuzzo told us was done because different countries are in different stages of their pandemics — also shows the U.S. lagging behind numerous other countries on per-capita tests, test positivity or both.
The website notes that countries’ testing programs ""should be scaled to the size of their epidemic, not the size of the population"" and says the positivity rate ""is the most reliable way to determine if a government is testing enough.""
The World Health Organization suggested on May 12 that nations achieve a 5% or lower test positivity rate for at least two weeks before considering loosening public health measures.
The cumulative test positivity rate in the U.S. has yet to go that low, although the U.S. is close to reaching that two-week benchmark, as data from the COVID Tracking Project demonstrates. 
The national number, however, still obscures vast differences in locations across the country. A Johns Hopkins data visualization shows that as of June 16, 34 states plus Washington, D.C., have had 5% or fewer tests come back positive, as averaged over the past seven days, while 16 states and Puerto Rico are still above that level.
Kudlow’s False Hospitalization Claim
In an interview on CNN about COVID-19, Kudlow inaccurately attributed rising hospitalization numbers in some parts of the country to elective procedures. Those figures are specific to people diagnosed with COVID-19, and therefore are unaffected by elective procedures.
Kudlow also suggested that increased testing was responsible for the uptick in cases. But more testing only partially explains the trends.
Kudlow made his remarks in a June 14 interview on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" with Jake Tapper. 
He first acknowledged that some places in the U.S. have recently seen a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections.
""We have had an increase in cases in some states. I don’t want to hide that. That’s a fact,"" he said. ""I think Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina and Florida. There have been some small metropolitan areas that have had an increase.""
But then he pointed out that testing has increased, and said that hospitalizations were up because of elective procedures now being allowed.
""Now, remember, Jake, we are now testing at about a hundred times the rate we were back in March, when the pandemic first exploded,"" Kudlow said. ""[H]ospitalizations may be going up,"" he added, ""but that’s because elective procedures are now permitted. And maybe, most importantly, Jake, although the case rate has increased a bit, we’re not talking about a second round here.""
But hospitalizations are not up in some areas because of elective procedures. ""States should be tracking COVID-related hospitalizations,"" said Johns Hopkins’ Nuzzo in an email to FactCheck.org, ""not all hospitalizations.""
And indeed, they are, although not all states report hospitalizations or document them over time. Texas posted a record-high of 2,287 ""COVID-19 hospitalizations"" on the day Kudlow made his remarks — a tally that has since climbed to 2,518, according to the state dashboard. 
The number is the sum of all ""lab-confirmed"" COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the state’s trauma service areas, which has risen nearly 40% since Memorial Day.
State data in Arkansas also shows a surge since the end of May, with 214 ""currently hospitalized COVID-19 patients"" as of June 16 — approximately double the number two weeks ago.
North Carolina, too, has seen a steady rise in the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations for the past month. The state notes that the figures reflect the ""current hospitalizations due to COVID-19,"" which are self-reported by hospitals.
There is another hospital metric — bed use rates, or hospital capacity — that could change as hospitals reopen and begin to do more surgeries. As Nuzzo said, ""Bed availability is another element to track and that would be influenced by the resumption of elective procedures."" 
But even if that is what Kudlow meant — and we asked the White House for clarification, but didn’t hear back — it isn’t what he said.
Upticks in COVID-19 Cases Not Just Due to More Testing
Kudlow’s more fundamental claim, which Trump echoed and Pence also suggested, is that the increases some states are now seeing in their COVID-19 cases are because of expanded testing.
The New York Times reported on June 15 that Pence told governors in a private call to ""make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,"" and that in ""most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that’s more a result of the extraordinary work you’re doing.""
In the call, Pence also repeated Kudlow’s false claim that ""because people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up.""
At a roundtable the same day, the vice president said, ""We really believe that the vast majority of new cases is a reflection, as you said, of a dramatic increase in testing.""
He then gave the example of California, which he said had flat hospitalization and test positivity numbers. ""And in those areas where — just a few states — where we’re seeing positive rates go up, we’ll be talking to governors today, in states like Georgia and Arizona and Texas, about deploying additional CDC personnel to help them identify where those outbreaks are occurring and how we can mitigate those efforts.""
""With more than 22 million tests having been performed across the country, we — we continue to see overall that what’s called a positive test rate remains very stable in the country,"" he continued. ""As we said earlier, Mr. President, there is a few states where the positivity rate is climbing, and we’re working very closely with those governors to identify that.""
Pence is right that at least for now, the nation’s test positivity rate hasn’t gone up, and that California’s increased COVID-19 caseload is likely explained by bolstered testing. 
But that’s not true everywhere — and it’s not just a ""few"" states that have reported growth in their test positivity rates.
""It is true that the number of cases reflects not just how many cases there are in the community, but also testing capacity,"" Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us during a press call. But, she added, ""I think that the signals that we’re seeing from across the country are real, and they correspond to what we knew would happen when society started to open up, which is that we get more mixing, and we’ll start to see the emergence of the virus spreading again.""
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Wall Street Journal in a June 16 interview that while more testing leads to more cases, higher positivity rates in many states ""cannot be explained by increased testing.""
""Testing positivity is going UP in nearly half of US states, which is a sign that increasing case numbers is not just due to more testing,"" noted Nuzzo in a tweet.
Test positivity is an important metric because it should stay steady or decrease if increased testing is behind a higher number of identified cases. An increasing percentage of positive tests, as long as testing hasn’t dropped off, indicates a surge in infections.
According to a Johns Hopkins data visualization that tracks the weekly change in states’ test positivity numbers, many of the states with increases in the percentage of positive tests are located in the South.
Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, noted that testing could explain some — but not all — of the upticks.
""Are increased case counts partially attributable to increased testing?"" she asked in a tweet. ""Probably in part. But in places where hospitalizations and the % of tests that come back positive is high or rising, those are sure signs of trouble.""
In a June 11 call with reporters, Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, also emphasized looking at the hospitalization figures to understand what is happening — a point he later iterated in a Twitter thread.
""In Texas, if you look at the numbers in detail, you can see that hospitalization rate is going up. Similarly, in Arizona, ICU beds, hospitalization rates for COVID patients are going up. So those are real changes,"" he said. ""There are more sick people than there were a month ago, substantially more.""
He said California, though, did not have the same concerning trends. ""In California, even though the number of daily cases is higher on a day-to-day basis than it was weeks ago, the overall hospitalization rate on their dashboard is stable,"" he said. ""So that would suggest perhaps there’s more testing going on in California and maybe they’re finding more mild and moderate cases, but they aren’t seeing a rise in the number of very sick people.""
""Other states like Florida aren’t reporting hospitalization,"" he added. ""So you can’t really make any determinations without having access to that data.""
Many public health experts suspect that reopening policies are behind the rise in some states, although Inglesby noted that not all states have experienced increases.
""In some cases, some states that have reopened have not had sharp rises. I think as reopening goes forward, we’ll be able to know more,"" he said. ""But what we do know is that this virus transmits person to person, the more activity that’s allowed that is based on close personal interaction, the more opportunities there will be for transmission.""
Buckee said it was too early to know what will happen for certain, but that the rising number of cases in some places will likely lead to more severe illnesses and deaths, even if it hasn’t shown up yet.
""I think that there’s no question that we’re going to see a surge in hospitalizations and deaths in places like Arizona, due to that uptick in cases,"" she said. ""It’s just a matter of waiting for a few weeks.""
Cases that happen now, she said, will result in deaths in about three weeks.
In addition to the increase in cases, she said many of the states in the southeastern U.S. have worrying demographic factors as well, which put those populations at higher risk.
""The concern is not just the policies and the reopening and spreading of the virus, but the significant risks of morbidity and mortality in those populations,"" she said. ""We know that African American communities are being hit particularly hard, diabetes is a risk factor, and so on. Those are all going to mean that we expect more illness and more death from COVID.""
Oklahoma’s ‘COVID-19 Current Hospitalizations,’ Cases Increase
On ABC’s ""This Week,"" Sen. Lankford of Oklahoma was asked whether the president should postpone his Tulsa rally due to health concerns.
""I do not believe so, actually,"" Lankford said. ""We’ve gone through phase one, phase two, and phase three. We continue to see hospitalizations decline, deaths decline in Oklahoma.""
The senator is right about COVID-19 deaths, but not about hospitalizations.
In its most recent Weekly Epidemiology and Surveillance Report for the week of June 5 through June 11, the Oklahoma Department of Health said there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.
Oklahoma Department of Health, June 12: Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, though the number of deaths have remained approximately the same and the percentage of positives remains low at 3.7%. The increase in the number of cases is caused by both ongoing community transmission and outbreaks that affect specific populations. The threat of COVID still exists and we anticipate it to grow.
For the two-week reporting period, from June 1 to June 12, the number of ""COVID-19 Cases Currently Hospitalized"" increased from 69 to 86, according to separate Executive Order Reports that the state Health Department publishes every weekday.
As of June 15, there were 98 current hospitalizations — the highest since May 7, when there were 113 people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, which tracks hospitalization data for 42 states, including Oklahoma.
Prior to Lankford’s appearance on ""This Week,"" the Executive Order Reports showed a one-day drop on June 11, from 97 to 86. But, until the June 11 drop, there were six straight days of more COVID-19 hospitalizations, the reports show.
The most recent weekly epidemiology report also said there were 719 confirmed cases for the week ending June 11, an increase of 12.9% from the previous week, while deaths had declined 11.6%.
Despite the current uptick in COVID-19 hospitalizations, there are still far fewer than there were in mid-April, according to the Carlson School of Management’s hospitalization tracking website. The Sooner State recorded the highest number of hospitalizations on April 13, when 194 people were hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the university website.
(Technical note: The state also issues ""situation update"" reports every weekday that provide ""current hospitalizations,"" which the state Health Department says represent ""a combination of hospitalized positive cases and hospitalized persons under investigation."" The Carlson School’s website reports ""only the confirmed cases of hospitalizations"" when a state provides the data, as Oklahoma does, according to Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a professor of health care risk management and a project team leader. We, too, are using only confirmed cases for this story.)
Oklahoma has been slowly reopening its businesses since April 24, when it entered what Gov. Kevin Stitt called phase 1 of a three-phase plan. The state fully opened for business on June 1.
""Under Phase 3, businesses may resume unrestricted staffing at their worksites by observing proper CDC-recommended social distancing protocols and are recommended to continue increased cleaning and disinfecting practices,"" according to a press release issued by the governor’s office. ""Individuals should minimize time spent in crowded environments and continue following CDC guidelines regarding social distancing.""
Despite the state’s advice to ""minimize time spent in crowded environments,"" Trump said he expects to fill the BOK Center, which seats about 19,000, and is looking for a second location to increase capacity for the event.
""We have a 22,000-seat arena, but I think we’re going to also take the convention hall next door, and that’s going to hold 40,000,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on June 15. ""So we’ll have 22,000 plus 40,000. … [I]t’s an amazing — nobody has ever heard numbers like this. I think we’re going to have a — we’re going to have a great time.""
At the same Cabinet meeting, Pence expressed confidence about Oklahoma’s ability to host the rally, in part because COVID-19 cases in the state have ""declined precipitously.""
Pence, June 15: The number of cases in Oklahoma — it’s declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward with the rally this coming weekend.
That’s false. As we stated earlier, the state reports that the number of COVID-19 cases is now on the rise in Oklahoma.
In its weekly epidemiology report for May 29 through June 4, the state Health Department said there had been ""637 confirmed cases in the past week 8.0% increase from the week before (May 22-28)."" A week later, the department said that from June 5 to June 11 there had been ""719 confirmed cases in the past week 12.9% increase from the week before (May 29-June 4).""
A day after Pence’s remarks, the state recorded a single-day high of 228 new cases on June 16, as well as four deaths.
As of June 11, at the time of the last weekly report, the state had 7,626 confirmed cases. As of June 16, Oklahoma had 8,645 confirmed cases — an increase of 1,019 cases, the daily state data shows.
Update, June 18: The article was updated to include comments about testing from NIAID Director Anthony Fauci.

		Quick Take
The National Security Council is warning Americans of a ""FAKE"" rumor circulating on social media that falsely claims President Donald Trump will impose a nationwide ""mandatory quarantine."" President Donald Trump said his administration ""may look at certain areas,"" but it is not considering anything that would affect the whole country ""at this time.""

Full Story
A rumor inciting Americans to ""stock up"" on two weeks of supplies, claiming a ""mandatory"" nationwide quarantine will soon be implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been circulating online. It’s false.
The rumor started as a text message and migrated to social media as a screenshot meme, claiming: ""within 48 to 72 Hours… The president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation. Stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything. Please forward to your network.""
Different versions of the rumor attribute this misinformation to various sources, including ""military friends,"" the ""DC mayor,"" and ""a physician at the Clev. Clinic.""
Each version is false.
The White House’s National Security Council addressed the claim in a statement on Twitter, saying: ""Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.""


President Donald Trump also rejected the idea that his administration is considering a ""nationwide lockdown."" When asked about it by a reporter on March 16, Trump said: ""We may look at certain areas, certain hot spots as they call them."" But, he added, ""at this moment,"" they are not considering anything that would affect the whole country.
The day before, Trump had urged Americans not to panic. Following a call with the CEOs of more than a dozen major grocers and food suppliers on March 15, he said that the U.S. supply chains are ""powerful"" and ""[t]here’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies.""
The only thing the rumor gets right is its reference to the Stafford Act, which Trump invoked when he declared a national emergency on March 13. Before making the false claim about the mandatory quarantine, it says: ""within 48 to 72 Hours the president will evoke what is called the Stafford act.""
However, Trump’s use of that federal disaster relief law actually allows for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help state and local governments dealing with the outbreak.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that organizers cancel events that host more than 50 attendees. It also has suggested strategies that communities can implement to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, but there is currently no federally mandated ""quarantine.""

      FactChecking Biden’s Town Hall

		President Joe Biden got some facts wrong and spun others in a Feb. 16 town hall that aired on CNN.

He said it was ""not true"" that he had revised his 100-day school reopening goal, saying it ""was reported"" that he meant a majority of schools only need to be open one day a week. That’s exactly what his press secretary had said.
Biden left the false impression that the preceding administration had contracted for fewer COVID-19 vaccines than it actually had.
The president wrongly claimed that Federally Qualified Health Centers would now receive 1 million vaccines per week. That’s the total number of vaccines that they will receive, not the weekly amount.
He claimed, without evidence, that racehorse owners receive tax breaks worth almost $9 billion.
Regarding his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, Biden said there is ""consensus among economists left, right, and center"" that ""we can’t spend too much."" But some center-left economists say the plan may be too large.
The president wrongly said the federal minimum wage of $7.25 would be $20 if it had been indexed for inflation; he instead meant if it had been indexed for worker productivity.
Biden wrongly claimed the ""vast majority"" of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are not ""Hispanics,"" but ""people who came on a visa … and didn’t go home."" Most of the unauthorized population came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico and other Latin American nations.

The town hall was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Biden Clarifies School Reopening Goal
Biden said it was ""not true"" that he had revised his 100-day school reopening goal to mean a majority of schools only need to be open one day a week, claiming that was ""what was reported.""
It’s what was reported because that’s exactly what White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.
As we noted in our story ""Biden’s Underwhelming School Reopening Goal,"" two studies that looked at random samples of school districts around the country estimated that a majority of schools were already offering in-person school at least one day a week, and had been doing so before Biden took office.
At his town hall, Biden told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that his 100-day goal is to have a majority of kindergarten through eighth grade schools open five days a week, and he blamed the confusion on ""a mistake in the communication.""
Cooper: Well, let me ask you, your administration had set a goal to open the majority of schools in your first 100 days. You’re now saying that means those schools may only be open for at least one day a week —
Biden: No, that’s not true. That’s what was reported. That’s not true. That was a mistake in the communication. But what I’m talking about is I said opening the majority of schools in K through eighth grade, because they’re the easiest to open, the most needed to be open in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay at home.
Cooper: So when do you think that would be K through eight, at least five days a week if possible?
Biden: I think we’ll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days.
Biden’s answer may have left the impression that the media had misreported the specifics of his goal. But that’s not the case.
The fine-print addition to Biden’s stated 100-day goal was detailed by Psaki in a Feb. 9 press briefing, when a reporter asked what exactly Biden’s definition of ""open schools"" was.
""His goal that he set is to have the majority of schools — so, more than 50 percent — open by day 100 of his presidency,"" Psaki said. ""And that means some teaching in classrooms. So, at least one day a week. Hopefully, it’s more. And obviously, it is as much as is safe in each school and local district."" Later, she put it his way: ""teaching at least one day a week in the majority of schools, by day 100.""
Psaki did not move off that clarification of the goal when asked at a press conference the following day why Biden had never ""mentioned the small print that that was just going to be for one day a week."" Psaki said, essentially, that no one had asked.
""The president made a — set a goal of reopening the majority of schools within 100 days, and when you asked what that meant, I answered the question,"" Psaki said.
Psaki described that narrower goal as ""our own effort to … set a bold and ambitious agenda for how we’re going to measure ourselves and progress."" She added that the administration hoped to ""exceed"" that goal.
Indeed, as we have written, the U.S. may already be exceeding the goal defined by Psaki. According to Burbio, a company that aggregates school event information and tracks school reopenings, 40.6% of K-12 students in the U.S. are attending schools that offer traditional, in-person learning; 25.5% are attending schools that offer hybrid, or two to three days a week in-person learning; and 33.9% are attending schools that offer ""virtual only"" school.
In other words, as of Feb. 10, an estimated 66.1% of K-12 students attended schools that offer either traditional in-person instruction every day, or hybrid instruction — at least one day a week in person.
Reaching the goal as stated by Biden may take a little longer. As we said, Burbio estimates that about 40% of K-12 students in the U.S. are attending regular, full-time, in-person school.
We should note that the Burbio data is for K-12 students, and Biden’s goal is specifically for kindergarten through eighth grade — not high schools — a caveat Biden has been adding since late December. At the town hall, Biden said his goal has been focused on the earlier grades ""because they’re the easiest to open, the most needed to be open in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay home"" and because high school students ""socialize a lot more and they’re older and they transmit more than young kids do.""
The Department of Education says it will begin collecting data on the status of elementary and middle school reopenings, but that information is not yet available.
Vaccine Confusion
Biden made some confusing comments on the amount of COVID-19 vaccines that were available when he took office, and his remarks left the false impression that the preceding administration had contracted for fewer vaccines than it actually had.
Biden said when he took office ""there was only 50 million doses that were available. We have now, by the end of July we’ll have over 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate every single American.""
Shortly after that, he said that ""we got into office and found out the supply, there was no backlog, I mean there was nothing in the refrigerator figuratively and literally speaking.""
The latter comment appeared to contradict his earlier statement that there were 50 million doses available when he was inaugurated, but Biden said ""there was no backlog.""
That’s not surprising, given the Washington Post had reported on Jan. 15 that the Trump administration had stopped holding in reserve second doses of the vaccines and had begun sending those to states in late December. (Both of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized so far — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — require two shots, spaced a few weeks apart.) The then-incoming Biden administration also had supported such a policy of not holding back doses.
There was a backlog in terms of allocated vaccines not yet being administered. As of the morning of Jan. 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 50 million doses had been distributed and nearly 30 million had been administered. As of the morning of Feb. 17, 56.2 million doses have been administered out of 72.4 million delivered, according to the CDC.
Overall, there have been issues with vaccine supply. A late December NBC News analysis determined: ""The Trump administration’s Covid-19 vaccine distribution program needs a major shot in the arm because at the current rate, it would take almost 10 years to inoculate enough Americans to get the pandemic under control.""
As for Biden’s comment that ""by the end of July we’ll have over 600 million doses,"" that was the plan of Donald Trump’s administration, too, though that plan depended on other vaccines in development getting authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The Biden administration asked Pfizer and Moderna, the only two companies that now have authorized COVID-19 vaccines, to provide the U.S. with more.
According to the Government Accountability Office, ""As of December 31, 2020, the government had at least 800 million vaccine doses under contract expected to be delivered by July 31, 2021, pending any issues with clinical trials, EUA issuance, or other factors."" Those doses included vaccines from four companies who have not yet received FDA authorization.
In the town hall, Biden said: ""We’ve moved out, went to the Pfizer and Moderna and said, can you produce more vaccine and more rapidly? They not only agreed to go from 200 to 400, then they agreed to go to 600 million doses.""
Pfizer and Moderna had already agreed to go to 400 million doses (200 million each) in December. The initial agreement with the Trump administration was for 200 million doses total from the two companies, but the administration made agreements for another 200 million total by July 31, according to the GAO report.
The Biden administration announced this month the two companies would provide another 200 million doses by then, for a total of 600 million.
Vaccines for Federal Health Centers
When asked what he would do to increase the number of available vaccines for Black and Hispanic people, Biden overstated what his administration has done.
Biden wrongly claimed that Federally Qualified Health Centers, or FQHCs, would now receive 1 million vaccines per week. But that’s the total number of vaccines that they will receive — at least initially.
Biden: That’s why last week I opened up, I met with the Black Caucus in the United States Congress and agreed that I would — all of the — all of community health centers now, which take care of the toughest of the toughest neighborhoods in terms of illness, they are going to get a million doses, you know, a week, and how we’re going to move forward because they’re in the neighborhood.
On Feb. 9, the Biden administration announced that FQHCs would receive vaccines for their clients, beginning Feb. 15. On the day of the announcement, Psaki, the White House press secretary, said, ""Ultimately, in this initial program phase, we plan to reach 250 community health centers. And again, across this initial phase, our goal is to allocate 1 million doses during this phase. That’s 500,000 first doses and 500,000 second doses.""
Tax Breaks for Racehorse Owners
Biden claimed, without evidence, that racehorse owners receive tax breaks worth almost $9 billion. The president made that remark while advocating for having the federal government pay to provide free tuition for community college students.
Biden: Everyone should be able to go to community college for free, for free. That costs $9 billion. And we should pay for it. And the tax policies we have now, we should be able to pay for you. You spend almost that much money as a break for people who own racehorses.
Biden is right that it would cost about $9 billion to provide free tuition at the two-year colleges, according to the Department of Education. But we found no evidence of a $9 billion tax break for racehorse owners. The White House did not provide any evidence, and tax and budget experts we interviewed were left scratching their heads trying to figure out what the president meant.
There was criticism late last year of certain tax provisions contained in a massive $2.3 trillion bill that then-President Trump signed into law on Dec. 27 to fund the government and provide COVID-19 relief.
Among other things, the bill contained provisions that benefited racehorse owners. ""The provision most people focus on is the special cost-recovery rule for racehorses age 2 or younger,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us.
""Most horses must be depreciated over 7 years, but one of the tax extenders temporarily allows these young horses to be depreciated over just 3 years,"" Gleckman explained. ""This is scheduled to expire at the end of 2021.""
But the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper, said that provision had no impact on federal revenues, despite criticism of it. ""Special depreciation rules for young racehorses may be indefensible as tax policy but they don’t cost the government a lot of money, at least in the context of the federal budget,"" Gleckman said.
""Horse breeding overall is a relatively small business as these things go: about $1b annually in revenues"" for all North American breeders, Gleckman said, citing 2019 data from the Jockey Club. Alicia Hughes, a spokeswoman for the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, also cited the $1 billion in annual revenues in an email to us about Biden’s statement.
""The President is NOT correct when he says the tax break for horse owners costs almost $9 billion – especially when the total sales figures for horses at public auction is only around $1 billion,"" she said. 
Alex Waldrop, CEO of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, said: ""I don’t really know what he’s referring to."" He was not alone. 
Steve Ellis, president of the government waste watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Biden’s remark about racehorse owners ""leaves me scratching my head,"" adding, ""for the life of me I can’t figure out what he was referencing beyond this relatively small provision.""
Size of the Proposed Rescue Package
Biden said there is ""consensus among economists left, right, and center"" that ""we can’t spend too much"" in a COVID-19 relief bill. In fact, even some center-left-leaning economists have raised concerns that Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan may be too large.
Cooper: You’ve made passing COVID relief bill the focus of your first 100 days. Those on the right say the proposal is too big. Some on the left say it’s not big enough. Are you committed to passing $1.9 trillion bill or is that final number still up for negotiation?
Biden: I’m committed to pass — look, here’s — some of you are probably economists or college professors or you’re teachers in school. This is the first time in my career — and as you can tell, I’m over 30 — the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over — and including the IMF and in Europe, that overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much.
In fact, there has been spirited debate among center-left economists about just that.
In an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Feb. 5, Larry Summers, former U.S. treasury secretary to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s National Economic Council chair, argued that legislators needed to consider the potential risk that the spending is too large.
""Judged relative to either the macroeconomic output gap or declines in family incomes, the proposed covid-19 relief package appears very large,"" Summers wrote.
Summers warned the massive spending package could trigger a sharp rise in inflation and could hinder future ""public investments that should be the nation’s highest priority.""
Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard echoed Summers’ concerns, writing on Twitter on Feb. 5, ""I am known as a dove. I believe that the absolute priority is to protect people and firms affected by covid. Still, I agree with Summers. The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive. Protection can be achieved with less.""
The following day, Blanchard added, ""Let me double down and go through some numbers. I agree that too much is better than too little and we should aim for some overheating. The question is how much. Much too much is both possible and harmful. I think this package is too much.""
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the New York Times, ""We’re already in uncharted territory."" Noting that fourth-quarter gross domestic product was only about $119 billion below where it was a year ago, Holtz-Eakin said, ""Do we need another $1.9 trillion to deal with that problem? I have an arithmetic problem with where we are.""
In an analysis of Biden’s plan, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculated that the $1.9 trillion proposal would ""likely be enough to close the output gap"" between actual and potential GDP ""two to three times over."" That ""overshoot could be beneficial"" the report states, but the authors also warned it could ""pose risks to the economy and the fiscal outlook.""
""While the economy can operate above its long-term potential for periods of time, it cannot do so indefinitely or sustainably,"" the authors wrote. ""One possibility is that the excess funds are economically ineffective, adding to the debt without improving the economy."" The excess stimulus could also lead to higher inflation, the report states, and could lead to ""an economic cliff or crash as the stimulus fades.""
To be sure, there are also many economists who think the stimulus package proposed by Biden is appropriately sized. We’re not going to wade into how many economists may agree or disagree with Biden’s proposal, let alone who is right, but as the examples we cited above show, Biden was stretching the facts when he claimed there is ""consensus among economists left, right, and center"" that ""we can’t spend too much.""
Off on Minimum Wage
In talking about his support for a $15 federal minimum wage, Biden mixed up his talking points, wrongly saying that if the current rate had been indexed for inflation, it would be $20 an hour now.
Biden: For example, if it went — if we gradually increased it — when we indexed it at $7.20, if we kept it indexed by — to inflation, people would be making 20 bucks an hour right now.
The federal minimum wage was set at $7.25 in July 2009, and it remains there today. If it had been tied to inflation, however, it would be $8.81, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator.
The left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, however, did say that the minimum wage would be more than $20 if it had kept pace with worker productivity, not inflation. The White House press office referred us to that report. ""While the national minimum wage did rise roughly in step with productivity growth from its inception in 1938 until 1968, in the more than five decades since then, it has not even kept pace with inflation,"" senior economist Dean Baker wrote in January 2020. ""However, if the minimum wage did rise in step with productivity growth since 1968 it would be over $24 an hour today.""
Immigration and Overstaying Visas
While answering a question on whether he would sign immigration legislation that did not include a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people already living in the U.S. illegally, Biden wrongly said that most of the unauthorized population is not Hispanic and came to the U.S. legally but overstayed their visas.
""The vast majority of the people, those 11 million undocumented, they’re not Hispanics,"" Biden said. ""They’re people who came on a visa, was able to buy a ticket to get in a plane, and didn’t go home. They didn’t come across the Rio Grande and swim.""
That’s false.
A February 2020 report written by Robert Warren of the Center for Migration Studies estimated that, of the 10.6 million people in the U.S. illegally in 2018, ""about 5.7 million (54 percent) entered across the border, and 4.9 million (46 percent) entered with a temporary visa and overstayed.""
The report does make the point that a majority of the 4 million of the total unauthorized population who arrived between 2010 and 2018 originally came to the U.S. legally. 
""Of those, 2.6 million (66 percent) overstayed their temporary visas, and 1.3 million (34 percent) entered illegally across the border,"" it said.
And though the report doesn’t offer a breakdown by race or ethnicity, it does show that at least 70% of individuals in the U.S. illegally, as of 2018, are estimated to have come from primarily Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. Mexico alone (5.11 million) accounted for nearly half (48%) of the unauthorized population in the U.S. in 2018, the report said.
Those figures are similar to the most recent country-of-origin estimates from the Migration Policy Institute.

Following the deaths of four British Airways pilots and five Air India pilots, social media posts claimed without proof that the pilots died as a result of receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Air India said its pilots died from COVID-19. British Airways said ""there is no truth whatsoever in the claims on social media speculating that the four deaths are linked.""

              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected the aviation industry on a global scale, as we’ve reported, causing massive layoffs and unexpected deaths among employees. The International Air Transport Association categorized last year as ""the worst year in history"" for air travel demand, with global passenger traffic declining 66% compared with 2019.
 In April 2020, British Airways announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs due to the pandemic — totaling more than a quarter of the company’s jobs. 
In recent months, British Airways also suffered the deaths of four pilots. 
The loss of the British pilots — and pilots’ deaths in other countries — sparked a burst of unsubstantiated claims about the cause of their deaths on social media.  


""Four British Airway PILOTS have DIED of the COVID VACCINE in the past 7-days,"" read a post on Facebook. Another Facebook post repeated a similar false claim about the pilots dying ""in the same week, just days after getting [the] second"" vaccine dose.
A post on Instagram read, ""4 British Airways pilots DEAD. 1 Delta pilot DEAD. Canadian pilot unconscious on runway. All in ONE WEEK. What do they all have in common? [Needle emoji] Safe Travels!"" 
But it’s not true that all the British pilots died in the same week, and there is no evidence the pilots died after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
In response to the claims, British Airways tweeted on June 17: ""Sadly four members of our pilot community passed away recently. Our thoughts are with their family and friends. However, there is no truth whatsoever in the claims on social media speculating that the four deaths are linked.""
Capt. Nicholas Synnott died in early June following a long battle with COVID-19. Senior First Officer Edward Brice-Bennett was declared dead on June 2, after being found unconscious on a mountain bike trail, according to news reports. Snopes confirmed the death of Senior First Officer Grant Mercer, who passed away on May 4, and a person with knowledge of the circumstances of his death said it had no connection with the COVID-19 vaccination. The fourth pilot was not identified by the airline or in media reports.
A British Airways spokesperson told Reuters that none of the deaths were linked to vaccines. British Airways hasn’t said if the pilots were vaccinated. We could find no public mention that they received a first or second vaccine dose.
Yet the claim keeps spreading, adding more unfounded details and a baseless claim that five Indian pilots died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. 
""Five vaxxed British Airway pilots just died in a week from heart attacks and internal bleeding. A 6th has severe blood clots that have disqualified him from flying. 5 commercial pilots in India just died after being vaxxed in May,"" read an Instagram post shared on June 22.  
As we’ve reported, there is no evidence of an added risk of blood clots for vaccinated air travelers, as suggested in the Instagram post.
There is also no evidence that the Indian pilots had been vaccinated, as the Instagram post claimed. In fact, Air India has said the five pilots died in May of COVID-19. The deaths occurred between May 9 and May 30, according to Asian News International.
A second wave of the pandemic — which started in mid-March and peaked in May — infected millions and killed tens of thousands across India, hitting at a time when the country was experiencing a vaccine shortage. 
As of June 29, India had one of the lowest vaccination rates, with only 19.05% of the population receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Pilots and aircrew were essential in the efforts to contain the outbreak by evacuating some citizens and delivering essential items, such as oxygen tanks or ventilators.
Unfortunately, frequent traveling puts pilots at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association, a union of Air India pilots, wrote a letter to the airline management on May 4, stating, ""Many crew have been diagnosed Covid positive and are struggling to get oxygen cylinders. We are left to fend for ourselves for hospitalization."" 
Air India, a public limited company, said later on May 4 that it would vaccinate all of its employees against COVID-19 by the end of the month.
But on May 10 the carrier announced it had to cancel the vaccination drive, saying, ""The proposed Covid vaccination camp at GSD Complex, Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) on May 11 and May 13 stands cancelled because government authorities have expressed inability to hold these camps due to non-availability of vaccines.""
After facing pay cuts and being denied a priority for vaccinations, many pilots contracted COVID-19. Since February, 17 pilots have died of COVID-19 from several Indian airlines — including the five Air India pilots who died in May.  
On June 3, Air India officials announced that pilots Captain Harsh Tiwary, Captain Gurpratap S. Gill, Captain Prasad Karmakar, Captain Sandeep Rana and Captain Amitesh Prasad died due to COVID-19. The airline also said it had started vaccinating its employees on May 15 after a delay due to the lack of vaccines.
There is no evidence the Air India pilots received vaccines, as suggested by the social media post.

      Trump’s False Claim on Coronavirus Harm

		The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that through May 30, 14% of confirmed coronavirus cases led to hospitalizations — including 2% in intensive care units. But President Donald Trump falsely claimed ""99%"" of cases ""are totally harmless.""
The president, according to his press secretary, was referring to the case fatality rate, and he claimed the amount of testing the U.S. has conducted showed this. The testing actually shows a case fatality rate of 4.5%, but not everyone who has contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has been tested. Some estimates say the fatality rate among those infected is likely around 1%.
Asked whether cases that don’t result in death are ""harmless,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: ""The president was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this.""
""Some estimates do place the mortality at about 1%,"" Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us in an email, noting that we don’t have a solid figure for the total number of people who have been infected. ""However, 1% mortality is not the same as ‘99% … totally harmless’. I wish that were true. ‘Totally harmless’ suggests that the infection doesn’t do any harm.""
In addition to patients who get sick enough to need hospitalization, some who have recovered from COVID-19 report experiencing long-term effects, ""including lung damage but also other symptoms, and we don’t know how common these sequelae (the term for aftereffects of disease) are,"" Morse said.
Trump made his claim in July 4 remarks at the White House.
""Likewise, testing — there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people,"" he said. ""By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country can show, because no other country has testing that we have — not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.""
The president exaggerated the number of tests a bit: 36.3 million had been conducted as of July 3, according to the CDC. The COVID Tracking Project had the total at 34.9 million as of July 4.
What those tests show is that 2.8 million people had tested positive for COVID-19 and 122,464 had died in the U.S., as of July 4. That puts the case-fatality rate — the percentage of confirmed cases that resulted in death — at more than 4%.
Trump is also wrong to say these are ""results that no other country can show."" Several countries have lower case fatality rates than the U.S.
Among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19 now, the U.S. has the sixth highest case fatality rate — which means 14 other countries have lower rates, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.
And, as we’ve written before, the president is wrong to claim other countries don’t have the same ""quality"" of tests. Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us in late April there wasn’t any data to support Trump’s claims that the U.S. tests are better than those in other countries. 
Morse said: ""Most of our tests for the virus are of very good quality, but quality varies, too, and many tests in other countries use the same methodology and are just as good."" 
Mortality Rates and Disease Severity
""There’s a lot of debate about the infection fatality rate,"" Dr. Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said in a July 6 press call. ""I think the broad consensus in the community is that the infection fatality rate is somewhere between 0.6% and 1%,"" but that varies based on whether a population is older or younger.
Jha pointed to a study published in the Lancet on July 6 that used antibody tests to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain. The findings — that about 5% of the population could have been infected — suggest an infection fatality rate of 1.2%, as Jha explained in a Twitter thread.
Based on several studies in various countries, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said on July 2 that the infection fatality rate is about 0.6% — at least for now, according to the New York Times.
Jha said he thinks the rate ""should come down over time because we’re getting better at treating COVID.""
""And so somebody who spends three weeks in the ICU, has severe lung damage and would have died two months ago might now survive,"" he said. ""But let’s be very clear, that if you spent three weeks in the ICU, have severe, diffuse lung damage and you survive, it’s fabulous that you survived. That was not inconsequential.""
Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that’s ""still a lot of people,"" Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. ""I’m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.""
As of July 6, that figure was 130,208 deaths in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins’ figures.
""Whatever the proportion, we’ve had over 130,000 deaths in the US so far,"" Morse, at Columbia University, said, ""more than twice as many as died in the Vietnam War, and more than died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined, but I don’t think war could be called ‘99% harmless’.""
McEnany said in the July 6 press briefing that Trump’s claim was a reference to ""the fact that mortality in this country is very low."" And the case ""fatality rate in this country, vis-a-vis other European countries, is much lower than, let’s say, France and Italy.""
The U.S., at 4.5%, does have a lower case fatality rate than France (14.6%) and Italy (14.4%), as well as other countries, but a higher rate than many countries, too.
But McEnany’s explanation doesn’t support what Trump said, in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases are ""totally harmless.""
In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: ""Overall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died.""
A study published in late February by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention similarly found that 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. The latter category included ""respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.""
The WHO also says that 13.8% of confirmed coronavirus patients have severe disease and 6.1% have critical cases.
Beyond the harm caused by being sick and hospitalized, there are the financial ramifications of that treatment, the impact on hospitals of the pandemic and the burden to the U.S. health system, Riley said.
And even those who have mild symptoms may transmit the infection to others. ""They can still pass it on to others, who may get sick or even (tragically) die,"" Morse said.
Lingering and Long-Term Effects
Not much is known about how frequently COVID-19 patients suffer long-term effects, but there are signs that the disease does not always completely resolve itself as rapidly as expected — and is unlikely to be described as ""harmless"" by many who are affected.
""We don’t have any long-term data because the virus has only been around for a little while,"" said Harvard’s Jha. ""But we certainly are seeing more and more cases of people with … lingering symptoms.""
According to the WHO, it takes about two weeks for a person to recover from a mild case of COVID-19, and three to six weeks to recover from a severe or critical one.
Anecdotally, however, some patients — even those with mild cases — report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches, brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult.
These so-called ""long-haulers,"" as some call themselves, have shared their stories in online support groups and with journalists. One patient in the U.K. told The Atlantic that her case might be ""mild relative to dying in a hospital, but this virus has ruined my life.""
Without more data, it’s difficult to know how common these complaints are or why they might be happening, but similar types of symptoms have been reported in the wake of other viral infections, including SARS.
One hypothesis is that the lingering symptoms are the result of the immune system still reacting to the virus, even if infectious virus is long gone from the body.
Experts also have concerns that some proportion of those who survive severe COVID-19 infections may be left with organ damage.
""The amount of lung damage that we’re seeing in a lot of CAT scans make me very worried about functional capacity and long-term lung function in a lot of these people who survive,"" Jha said. ""And so my best guess — and it is just a guess — is a sizable minority of people who end up getting infected, I don’t know, 10, 20% of people will end up having meaningful long-term clinical effects of this virus.""
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute launched an observational study in June to investigate the long-term health effects of having been hospitalized with COVID-19, with a special focus on the heart and lungs.
Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, was asked about Trump’s ""totally harmless"" claim on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" on July 5. Hahn wouldn’t say whether the president was wrong.
""I’m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong,"" he said. ""[W]hat I will say is that we have data in the White House task force. Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously.""

		In a Labor Day press conference and at a rally in North Carolina the following day, President Donald Trump made several unsupported or inaccurate statements about a COVID-19 vaccine and distorted comments made by the Democratic ticket.

Trump charged Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris with spreading ""anti-vaccine conspiracy theories."" The candidates support properly approved vaccines, but have expressed concerns — shared by some in the scientific community — that Trump may not follow the standard protocols.
The president claimed without support that ""if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn’t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn’t have it all.""
Trump inaccurately said that ""we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas"" and that ""the numbers are looking unbelievably strong."" No trial has met its enrollment target of 30,000, and no one knows yet how the vaccines are performing.
While insisting that he has never said there will definitely be a vaccine in October or November, Trump repeated the idea that it was possible, and previously said that such timing was likely. Health officials have said a vaccine is unlikely to be available that soon.

Biden/Harris Vaccine Statements
The president distorted what Biden and Harris have said about a COVID-19 vaccine, calling for them to apologize for their ""anti-vaccine rhetoric."" The candidates have said that they are supportive of a safe and effective vaccine, but not one based on Trump’s word alone.
""[Biden and Harris] should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science,"" Trump said in his Labor Day press conference.
""And what’s happening is, all of a sudden, you’ll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric — it’s a politic rhetoric; that’s all it is. Just for politics,"" he continued. ""Because now they see we’ve done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before.""
Later, Trump focused on Harris, saying, ""[S]he’s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don’t think the achievement was a great achievement.""
The next day during a rally in North Carolina, Trump repeated the same sentiments, but went further to say that the pair was spreading ""anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.""
The White House did not explain which comments Trump was referencing, but he was likely responding to statements Harris made on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" when she said she would ""trust the word of public health experts and scientists"" about a vaccine, ""but not Donald Trump.""
In a clip of the interview, which was released on Sept. 6, Harris said she did not think scientists would get the ""last word"" on the efficacy of a vaccine.
""If past is prologue that they will not, they’ll be muzzled, they’ll be suppressed, they will be sidelined, because he’s looking at an election coming up in less than 60 days and he’s grasping for whatever he can get to pretend that he has been a leader on this issue when he is not,"" Harris said.
Scientists in the administration have communicated with the public throughout the pandemic, although some media appearances have been limited and Politico reported a Trump adviser unsuccessfully attempted to alter messaging about the coronavirus.
Harris was then asked if she’d receive a vaccine that was approved and distributed before Nov. 3, Election Day.
""Well, I think that’s going to be an issue for all of us,"" she replied. ""I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump. And it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he’s talking about. I will not take his word for it.""
Later in the interview, Harris said that she would trust National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci to give an accurate assessment of a COVID-19 vaccine and agreed that at some point in the future there would hopefully be a safe and effective vaccine available. She also emphasized the need for a vaccine distribution plan.
Biden was asked on Labor Day whether he’d take a COVID-19 vaccine before the election. ""I would want to see what the scientists said,"" he replied. ""I want full transparency on a vaccine. One of the problems is the way [Trump] is playing with politics. He’s said so many things that aren’t true, I’m worried if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it. And so he’s undermining public confidence.""
""But pray God we have it,"" Biden continued. ""If I could get a vaccine tomorrow, I’d do it. If it cost me the election I’d do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now,"" he said, adding, ""But we have to listen to the scientists.""
The same day at a labor union virtual event, Biden also said he’d take a COVID-19 vaccine ""[o]nly if it was completely transparent, that other experts in the country could look at it.""
Around the time Trump made his remarks at the rally, the Biden campaign released a statement that  outlined multiple ways the government should act to reassure Americans that any vaccine that receives authorization is safe and effective, including making the data publicly available along with statements from Fauci, the career Food and Drug Administration staff and relevant vaccine advisory committee.
The president can have his opinions on why his challengers made statements skeptical of a Trump-endorsed coronavirus shot, but it’s incorrect to suggest they do not support a coronavirus vaccine that has been fully vetted and properly approved.

Some scientists have expressed concerns similar to those of Biden and Harris about the FDA authorizing a vaccine before sufficient phase 3 data are available.

In June, University of Pennsylvania professors Dr. Paul Offit and Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who is a coronavirus adviser to Biden campaign, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times warning that Trump might attempt an ""October surprise"" and release a vaccine prematurely to sway the election.
Other experts have published similar articles in which they call on the FDA — the agency that would be responsible for authorization of a vaccine — not to act too soon or cave to political pressure.
Offit told the New York Times in August that other scientists working within government shared his concerns, and he told us that he remained worried about politics influencing a COVID-19 vaccine approval.
He pointed to mounting international pressure and the FDA’s previous decisions during the coronavirus pandemic, including the agency’s emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine — which was subsequently revoked — and for convalescent plasma, which has yet to be shown to be safe and effective for COVID-19.
Of course, not all scientists are anxious that the government will authorize a vaccine without the necessary evidence. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us in June that he had faith in the FDA not to release an insufficiently tested vaccine — a sentiment he still holds — but he was nevertheless concerned about the White House’s emphasis on speed.
""The messaging coming out of the White House is extremely poor and detrimental,"" he said, ""so it’s actually fomenting distrust and creating a problem.""
Importantly, there are no signs that the administration will deviate from its plan to authorize a vaccine only after the necessary phase 3 trial data are in.
In Senate testimony on Sept. 9, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said, ""I can’t say strongly enough that the decisions about how this vaccine is going to be evaluated and assessed is going to be based on science."" 
""Science and science alone will be the way in which this decision is made,"" he added. ""Otherwise, I’ll have no part of it.""
Fauci has made similar reassurances. He explained in a Sept. 3 CNN interview that the trials have independent data and safety monitoring boards that intermittently look at the data, and noted that the information would ultimately become public. ""So I think that we can have some confidence and have faith in what the FDA is saying,"" he said. ""They’re saying very explicitly that they’re going to be making the decision based on the scientific data and we hope that that’s going to be the case.""
In an interview with Science, Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed, said there had been ""absolutely no interference"" in the process so far and vowed to resign if that changed.
And on Sept. 8, the CEOs of all of the companies involved in the vaccines receiving U.S. governmental support pledged to make safety a ""top priority"" and only submit ""for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities.""
Vaccine Under Other Administrations
Trump boasted of his unique ability to provide for a rapid coronavirus vaccine, saying in his Sept. 7 remarks that ""if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn’t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn’t have it all.""
At the North Carolina rally the following day, he repeated the idea. ""This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations,"" he said. ""We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe.""
He has previously made similar claims, including at another North Carolina rally and in remarks throughout August.
It’s his opinion that he alone could pull off a vaccine in record time, but it’s premature to declare victory. And the idea that no other leader could do the same lacks support.
As we’ve explained before, the key idea behind Operation Warp Speed, which is to manufacture a vaccine before it’s known to work so that it can more quickly be distributed if it ends up being approved, is not new. It was done in 2009 for the H1N1 influenza vaccine. 
Although the effort this time is much larger, given the greater concern of the coronavirus pandemic, there’s no reason to think a different president would not have come up with a similar strategy, as other countries and organizations are using the same approach now.
Dr. Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response under Obama, noted that similar vaccine efforts were underway in other places around the world and that good progress was being made by companies that didn’t get involved with the U.S. government until recently.
""What the success is really due to is the success of science,"" she said.
Lurie, who now advises the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an organization dedicated to developing vaccines to stop epidemics, including COVID-19, said that previous investments in science and experiences from past administrations are what have allowed a fast response in these extraordinary circumstances.
""None of this response would have been possible without prior investments in science and technology,"" she said.
One key realization after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, was that existing vaccine technologies were simply too slow for pandemic situations. In 2010, the president’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology released a report recommending more investment and focusing on more rapid vaccine methods.   
After that report, Lurie said, there started to be investments, largely by NIH, to develop new vaccine platforms, which are bearing fruit today.
A New York Times article also explains that work underpinning Johnson & Johnson’s viral vector COVID-19 vaccine goes back more than a decade, including efforts to create a Zika vaccine before Trump came into office.
Collins, the NIH director, also noted during his Sept. 9 testimony on vaccines that the preparation effort has been decades in the making. ""There were things that Congress had done over the past couple of decades, the creation of BARDA, other things that you’ve mentioned, that made it possible to move more swiftly now,"" he said.
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, which is spearheading the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, was created by legislation President George W. Bush signed into law in 2006.
While Trump should get some credit for Operation Warp Speed, there’s no support for his claims that other administrations wouldn’t be able to achieve similar results.
Vaccine Trial Progress
Trump also exaggerated the progress of vaccine trials in his Labor Day press conference.
""If you talk to your sources in the FDA, you’ll see it’s going very, very well,"" Trump told a reporter when being asked to elaborate on his comments on Biden and Harris. ""The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.""
Later, he continued: ""You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we’re going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.""
No vaccine company has yet reached its enrollment goal of 30,000 participants for its phase 3 trial, although one is close. 
As of Sept. 7 — the day Trump made his remarks — Pfizer/BioNTech had enrolled 25,189 volunteers in 39 states, and Brazil and Argentina. 
As of Sept. 4, Moderna had enrolled 21,411 participants, all within the U.S. That day, the CEO said the company wanted to increase minority participation in the trial, even if that meant slower recruitment.
The third company currently performing a phase 3 trial in the U.S., AstraZeneca, began a trial in America on Aug. 31, but has not yet started recruitment. On Sept. 8, the company put its trial on hold to investigate a potential adverse reaction in a U.K. woman.
Although the idea is to test multiple candidates to make it more likely that at least one vaccine will prove successful, there is no guarantee that any of the vaccines being tested will work, despite Trump’s claim that there will be ""a good result, one way or the other, very soon.""
It’s unclear whether Trump means enrollment figures or trial data when he said the ""numbers are looking unbelievably strong."" We asked the White House for clarification, but did not hear back. 
Since the studies are double-blind, neither the president nor anyone within the companies or the FDA knows how well the vaccine is performing in the phase 3 trials so far. The only people privy to that information are those on the data and safety monitoring boards.
Vaccine Timing
During the Labor Day presser, Trump argued with a reporter about his past statements on when to expect a vaccine, saying that he said ""by the end of the year,"" not that there ""will"" be a vaccine earlier.
""I didn’t say what you said,"" Trump insisted. ""What I said is ‘by the end of the year.’ But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.""
We looked through Trump’s past comments on a vaccine, and did not find any cases in which he declared a vaccine would definitely be available by October or November. But he has suggested that the earlier time frame is even more likely. Experts and governmental officials disagree with that assessment.
Since May, Trump has been saying a vaccine will be ready ""very soon,"" usually without specifying what that means. But at a press briefing on Sept. 4, Trump suggested that a vaccine was probable by October. 
""We remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1st,"" he said. ""We think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October.""
That evening at a rally in North Carolina, Trump was even more explicit. ""It’ll be delivered, the vaccine, before the end of the year and frankly, maybe even during the month of October. I think October is even more likely.""
In August, the president also said that he thought it was likely a vaccine would be ready around Nov. 3. ""I’m optimistic that it’ll be probably around that date,"" he said. ""I believe we’ll have the vaccine before the end of the year certainly, but around that date, yes. I think so.""
Even in his comments on Labor Day, Trump focused on the earlier dates, mentioning them more frequently than the end of 2020. ""[I]t’s going to be done in a very short of period of time,"" he said. ""Could even have it during the month of October.""
""So we’re going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date,"" he said at another point, referring to the election. ""You know what date I’m talking about.""
Experts disagree with Trump’s rosiest predictions. In an interview with PBS on Sept. 8, Fauci said it was ""unlikely"" a vaccine would be available by Election Day, and that an answer about how well a vaccine works is ""more likely by the end of the year.""
""I do have cautious optimism that by the end of 2020, at least one of these vaccines will have emerged and turned out to be safe and effective,"" NIH head Collins said in his Sept. 9 congressional testimony. ""But even that is a guess. And certainly to try to predict whether it happens on a particular week, before or after a particular date in early November, is well beyond anything that any scientists right now could tell you and be confident that they know what they’re saying.""
The CEO of Pfizer also clarified his earlier statement that he expected to know whether his vaccine works by the end of October, explaining on NBC’s ""Today"" on Sept. 8 that the time frame was not the same as having shots ready to go into people’s arms.
""Right now, our model, our base case, predicts that we will have an answer by the end of October. Of course, this is only a prediction,"" he said. ""And that is only an answer.""
Slaoui, the Operation Warp Speed adviser, told NPR on Sept. 3 that there was a ""very, very low"" chance that the trials would provide results by the end of October. Instead, he suggested, it was more realistic to think there would be a limited number of vaccine doses for high-risk groups available by the end of the year, ramping up to cover the rest of the population by the middle of 2021.

		In this video, we look at some of the claims that President Donald Trump made when he announced his administration would halt funding for the World Health Organization.

The video reviews these statements that the president made in his April 14 announcement: 

Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claim that if he hadn’t put restrictions on travel from China, ""probably hundreds of thousands more"" would have died from the novel coronavirus. Research shows travel restrictions can delay the exportation of cases, but they can’t contain the spread of viruses.
The president exaggerated when he said the WHO ""actually fought"" the U.S. over his decision to impose travel restrictions on China. WHO has advised countries not to enact travel restrictions, but WHO leaders have not publicly criticized the U.S.’ decision. 
Trump accused the WHO of taking ""China’s assurances"" about the coronavirus ""at face value … even praising China for its so-called transparency."" But early on Trump also thanked China for ""their efforts and transparency.""
The president said the WHO failed to investigate ""credible reports"" of human-to-human transmission in December 2019, claiming the agency said the virus ""was not communicable."" But the WHO wasn’t notified of an outbreak in Wuhan until Dec. 31, and it never said the virus wasn’t communicable.

		Quick Take
A TV station’s report on a Michigan fine for those violating the state’s social distancing orders showed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at a signing ceremony with an intimate crowd of people — prompting accusations of hypocrisy on social media. But the footage used was from January 2019.


Full Story 
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced an emergency order on April 2 implementing a civil fine of up to $1,000 for those violating the state’s social distancing requirements related to COVID-19.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, however, did not sign that order at a crowded, shoulder-to-shoulder ceremony, as a viral screenshot of a TV news report suggests.
The screenshot includes an image of Whitmer with an intimate group behind her and a chyron that reads: ""State emergency order calls for fines up to $1,000 for ignoring social distancing.""
But the footage used was actually from the start of Whitmer’s term, in January 2019, and dealt with an executive directive that had nothing to do with the novel coronavirus — as the station behind the report has since acknowledged.
Across social media platforms, the report’s misleading juxtaposition of the footage and headline has fueled false claims of hypocrisy as posts of the screenshot have racked up tens of thousands of shares and likes.

""Shes signing this order as there’s 9 other people behind her standing shoulder to shoulder. And who knows how many camera men are on the opposite side,"" a meme on Facebook claims. ""Should they also get that $1000 fine? Or na?""
Another post of the screenshot with the erroneous claim appeared on the verified Instagram account of Tim Kennedy, a former UFC fighter, who wrote: ""The Governor of Michigan signs a measure setting $1,000 fine for ‘citizens’ who fail to keep a 6-foot social distance ….. #irony #hypocrite #cantmakethisup #covid19 #covid #covid_19 #tyranny.""
That post garnered more than 27,000 likes in 12 hours.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was among those who advanced the falsehood, sharing an April 12 tweet of the claim, prompting Whitmer to respond.
""Hello Senator! This photo is from January of 2019, and is being misused to spread fear and anger,"" Whitmer wrote. ""I know you would never intentionally mislead the public during a pandemic, so I’m hopeful you’ll correct this mistake as soon as possible. Stay safe, & happy Easter from Michigan 👋.""
Cruz said in a later post on the matter: ""When I found out the story was erroneous, I deleted the tweet."" Cruz cast blame on a ""MSM"" — mainstream media — ""error.""
On April 13, the station behind the report — WXYZ, the ABC affiliate in Detroit — published a post addressing the ""viral Whitmer photo"" and said that ""the video has caused confusion."" The screenshot was taken from ""a WXYZ report that aired on 7 Action News This Morning last week. It was part of a story on the $1,000 fines for those who violate the state’s social distancing order.
""News organizations routinely rely on file video, like the Governor’s signing ceremony from January 2019, when broadcasting stories where more current video may not be readily available,"" the station said. ""While the report did not expressly identify the video as the Governor signing the social distancing order, it should not have been used in this story as it allowed for confusion and misinterpretation.""
A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services told us there was no in-person signing ceremony for the recent order implementing the $1,000 civil fine.
Whitmer, a Democrat, has become known nationally during the coronavirus outbreak for her public criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has said Whitmer is on his list of potential running mate choices.

      Trump’s False Claim That Michigan Is ‘Closed’

		In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the state of Michigan is ""closed,"" specifically and falsely mentioning churches and schools.
In fact, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and a frequent target of Trump, lifted the state’s stay-at-home order on June 1. The vast majority of the state’s businesses are open with some restrictions, as are churches and schools, although some of the latter are teaching remotely.
Trump’s comments came on the day the federal government charged six men with conspiring to kidnap Whitmer. The governor’s coronavirus restrictions had triggered vehement disapproval and led to demonstrations by armed protesters at the state Capitol in Lansing in April and May.
Trump, Oct. 8: And she keeps her state closed, although we just won the big case, as you know, to open up Michigan, because what she’s doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed. The schools are closed, and the whole state is closed.
Trump returned to the theme at a virtual telerally he held for Michigan voters two days later.
Trump, Oct. 10: Uh, your governor has to open up her state. We, uh, as you know brought suit, and now. … And she lost the suit on a constitutional basis. Get your kids back to school. Uh, we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. And we’ve done a really good job on it, and you’ll see that very soon when the vaccines start coming out, and the final therapeutics.
Whitmer issued her stay-at-home order on March 23 in an effort to stem the state’s rising tide of COVID-19 cases. The order told residents to stay home, although there were a number of exemptions, and said that nonessential workers should not report to work and telework if possible. Whitmer lifted the order on June 1, although some businesses — including gyms, hair salons and theaters — remained shuttered. Whitmer has issued several orders on the subject.
A number of other restrictions have remained in effect, including limits on crowd size at gatherings. But some have been lifted. For example, last month Whitmer issued an executive order allowing movie theaters and bowling alleys to reopen effective Oct. 9, although with stringent restrictions on crowd size. (Gyms and salons had reopened earlier, in June.)
The New York Times, which monitors what’s open and what’s closed in all 50 states during the pandemic, lists nearly everything as open in Michigan, including retail stores, industries and houses of worship. The only thing it lists as shut down is indoor service at bars.
But even that is no longer the case. According to the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services on Oct. 9: ""There are no longer bar closures, but bars may only serve alcohol to gatherings seated at tables.""
As is true in many states, the situation in Michigan schools is a mixed bag, often dependent on local conditions. Some districts have students in class, while others have opted for remote learning. And some schools that opened up had to close in the face of flare-ups of COVID-19.
In August, Whitmer and legislative leaders reached a bipartisan agreement under which local school districts would determine their plans for reopening.
As for places of worship, a few days after issuing her initial stay-at-home order in March, Whitmer added language stating that ""[a] place of religious worship is not subject to penalty"" for exceeding restrictions on crowd size.
Despite the exemption, a group of churches filed a suit in May claiming Whitmer’s order violated religious freedom. The lawsuit sought to further exempt worshippers traveling to services from being subject to penalties. Two days after filing the suit, the churches put it on hold after Whitmer added language saying the exemption applied not just to places of religious worship but also to people attending and traveling to and from the services.
The situation in Michigan was complicated on Oct. 2 when the Michigan Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the 1945 law that Whitmer had relied on in issuing her emergency orders on COVID-19. Undeterred, Whitmer blasted the narrow 4-3 decision by the court’s four Republican justices. Whitmer noted that the decision would not go into effect for 21 days. After that, she said, the rules on masks and crowd size would continue ""under alternative sources of authority that were not at issue in today’s ruling.""
After the ruling, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, like Whitmer a Democrat, said Oct. 4 that she would no longer enforce Whitmer’s emergency orders through criminal prosecutions. A statement issued by her press secretary, Ryan Jarvi, also said: ""However, her decision is not binding on other law enforcement agencies or state departments with independent enforcement authority. It’s her fervent hope that people continue to abide by the measures that Governor Whitmer put in place — like wearing face masks, adhering to social distancing requirements and staying home when sick — since they’ve proven effective at saving lives. … We can respect both the court’s decision and the advice of medical experts by continuing with these important measures voluntarily.""
In the wake of the ruling, the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services, citing authority not covered by the state Supreme Court ruling, issued an emergency order replicating several aspects of Whitmer’s orders. They include requiring wearing masks at indoor and outdoor gatherings; limiting the size of crowds at indoor and outdoor gatherings, with some exceptions; and requiring bars to close indoor common areas. The crowd-size limits mirror those Whitmer had imposed and also exempt religious services.
For indoor gatherings of between 10 and 500 people, crowd size is restricted to 20% of normal capacity. Outdoor gatherings of between 10 and 1,000 people are allowed at venues with fixed seating at up to 30% of normal capacity and at 30 people per 1,000 square feet at venues without fixed seating.
Whitmer came under fire from Trump in April over her coronavirus restrictions. The president took to referring to the first-term governor, who was interviewed as a possible Democratic vice presidential nominee, as ""‘Half’ Whitmer"" and ""the woman in Michigan."" On April 17, he tweeted, ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!""
After news of the kidnapping plot against Whitmer surfaced, the governor said Trump was ""complicit"" because the president hadn’t sufficiently condemned white supremacist groups. Trump campaign official Jason Miller fired back by assailing Whitmer for ""the fact that she wakes up every day with such hatred in her heart towards President Trump.""
Rhetoric aside, Michigan is not ""closed,"" as Trump claimed.

		During his July 14 press conference from the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump made the outdated claim that U.S. deaths from COVID-19 are down ""tenfold.""
Data from three different sources show that, as of July 14, the total number, and seven-day average, of daily deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus had declined between threefold and fourfold from its peak more than two months ago.
Trump made the claim as he argued that news organizations have recently highlighted record increases in cases of the disease in several states, rather than focusing on the fact that deaths from COVID-19 have declined from their previous high.
Trump, July 14: And when I turn on the news, I see, ""cases, cases, cases."" They don’t talk about deaths being cut down to a level that — actually, ""tenfold,"" they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets — ""Tenfold."" Cut tenfold. Yes, but they don’t talk about that; they talk about cases.
Trump’s ""very respected"" source appears to be the Washington Times, which was merely quoting his press secretary. We searched the Nexis news database and couldn’t find any other news organization using the ""tenfold"" language.
On July 7, Trump tweeted about a Washington Times article that quoted White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying, in a July 6 press briefing, that there had been a ""tenfold"" decrease in deaths.
""The president is not downplaying the severity of the virus,"" McEnany said in response to a reporter’s question about Trump’s false claim that ""99%"" of COVID-19 cases ""are totally harmless."" She explained: ""What the president is noting is that at the height of this pandemic we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where on July 4 there were 254. That’s a tenfold decrease in mortality.""
We don’t know where McEnany got those figures; the White House didn’t tell us.
The data aggregation website Worldometer reports that there were 2,748 coronavirus-related deaths on April 21 — at the peak — and 265 deaths on July 4. Those aren’t the same totals McEnany cited — but it was a tenfold decrease, as she said.
However, daily deaths have increased in the days since — including in Arizona, California, Florida, South Carolina and Texas — meaning Trump’s ""tenfold"" talking point is stale.
On July 14, the day of Trump’s press conference, there were 935 deaths, according to Worldometer. That’s only a threefold decrease from the number of deaths on April 21.
Slightly different totals from two other sources also show less of a decline in daily deaths than Trump claimed.
There was a high of 2,752 deaths on April 15 and a total of 954 deaths on July 14, according to the New York Times. That’s a threefold decrease, as well.
In addition, the COVID Tracking Project reports that there were 736 deaths on July 14, which would be a nearly fourfold decrease from the peak of 2,742 deaths it reports for May 7. We have included a chart of that website’s totals to better illustrate how the number of daily deaths has changed over time. (Scroll to the right to see the full chart.)
<a href='https:&#47;&#47;covidtracking.com&#47;'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CT&#47;CTPWebsiteGallery&#47;3_USDeath&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a>                   
There also hasn’t been a tenfold decline in the seven-day average of deaths, which accounts for fluctuations in daily totals over a full week.
Here are those averages at their high point, and on July 14, according to Worldometer, the New York Times and the COVID Tracking Project.




7-Day Average of COVID-19 Deaths




High point
 July 14


Worldometer
2,254 (on April 21)
743


New York Times
2,232 (on April 17)
724


COVID Tracking Project
2,429 (on April 21)
689



Each source shows a decline of less than fourfold over those time periods.
Trump does have a point that daily deaths from COVID-19 ""are way down"" from their previous highs, as Trump noted in a July 9 interview on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show. The president claimed a ""tenfold"" decrease in ""mortality"" then, too. But on July 9, the number of daily deaths was already higher than it had been over the July 4 weekend.
And on July 14, it also was no longer the case that deaths had been ""cut tenfold,"" which is what Trump said in the Rose Garden. He has simply ignored the increases in daily deaths that have occurred since July 4.

      Trump’s Misleading Comments on Biden and the Coronavirus

		In July 14 remarks in the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump made a series of false, misleading and unsupported statements about the novel coronavirus and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s position on it.
Trump, July 14: [Biden] opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. ""Xenophobic,"" he called me. ""Xenophobic."" A month later, he admitted I was right.
We would’ve had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily-infected China. But we stopped it; we did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing on the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later, and even later than that, and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake. …
And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn’t want to do it. They thought it was a mistake. … And we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives by closing — by closing up, we saved millions, potentially millions of lives. Could be — a number that we’re actually working on — but it could be 2- to 3 million lives. …. But if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost.   
We’ll examine the errors one by one.
Not a ""travel ban."" First, as he repeatedly does, the president incorrectly describes the action that he took regarding travel from China, where the coronavirus was discovered last December. As we have previously reported, it wasn’t a ""travel ban.""
On Jan. 31, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that certain non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the last two weeks would be barred from entering the United States. U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their immediate families were exempt from the restrictions.
A New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect on Feb. 2. So this was hardly a ban.
Impact of travel restrictions. As he has before, Trump said that the travel restrictions ""saved tens of thousands of lives."" But as we reported, there is no evidence to support this, and the White House has provided none.
The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases, but do little to contain them.
We found no study that looked only at the U.S. travel restrictions Trump instituted, and we found only one study, which wasn’t peer-reviewed, on Australia, that found an impact on decreasing the number of deaths — but the study had a major limitation. It didn’t consider any impact of cases coming to Australia from other countries besides China.
As we’ve written, it’s possible the U.S. travel restrictions on China had some impact in slowing the importation of cases, but we don’t have evidence of that, or of what the magnitude of the impact would be.
Biden supported China travel restrictions. Trump charged without evidence or elaboration that if he had listened to Biden, ""hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost."" We asked the White House what he was referring to, but it provided no response, nor did the Trump campaign.
It seems likely the president was referring to the travel restrictions, since he said that Biden ""opposed my very strict travel ban."" In fact, Biden took no position on the China restrictions when they were implemented.
On March 12, Biden tweeted:


 
As we have written, Biden’s campaign said on April 3 that Biden backed Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.
""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.""
Biden called Trump ""xenophobic."" Trump is right that Biden called him xenophobic. But Biden didn’t make clear why he said that. The Biden campaign has said that was not in connection with the China travel restrictions.
As we have written, on the day the White House announced the restrictions, Biden said at a campaign event in Iowa that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans ""need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it."" He added, ""This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.""
The Biden campaign says Biden’s ""reference to xenophobia was about Trump’s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China,"" and that he was not talking about the travel rules.
HHS experts backed restrictions. Trump is also incorrect, as we have written, when he says that when it came to the travel restrictions, ""I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn’t want to do it.""
HHS Secretary Azar told reporters on Feb. 7, ""The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental. These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.""
""Closing up"" saved lives. We don’t know whether Trump is on target when he says that the lockdowns imposed by many states may have saved ""millions"" of lives. A study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley published on June 8 in the journal Nature found that lockdowns had prevented 60 million infections in the United States.
The study didn’t say how many lives were saved, but the lead researcher, Solomon Hsiang, did say the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect ""infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen."" A study by researchers at the Imperial College London estimated lockdowns saved about 3.1 million lives in 11 European countries.
Columbia University researchers concluded that 36,000 fewer deaths from the coronavirus would have occurred if the U.S. had imposed social distancing one week earlier in March.
Pelosi in Chinatown. Finally, Trump is wrong when he once again says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was ""dancing on the streets of Chinatown"" well after he imposed his travel restrictions. Trump has repeatedly falsely described Pelosi’s trip to Chinatown.
As we have written, Pelosi traveled to Chinatown on Feb. 24 in an effort to bolster the neighborhood’s restaurants and shops. Their business had fallen sharply in the wake of the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which as we said originated in China.
The visit came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the day of Pelosi’s visit, Trump tweeted this about the virus: ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!""
For a time Pelosi’s visit became a staple in Trump’s remarks. He variously described her as holding a ""rally"" in Chinatown, having or wanting to have ""parties"" or a ""street party"" there, and encouraging people to go to a ""big parade."" In May, Trump shifted to references to Pelosi ""dancing in the streets of San Francisco in Chinatown."" None of these things ever happened. She was interviewed as she shopped.

      Colorado Vaccine Bill Includes Nonmedical Exemptions for Children

		Quick Take
A Facebook meme falsely claims a Colorado bill is ""removing exemptions"" for parents who don’t want to vaccinate their children in order to attend school. The bill adds new requirements to opt out of vaccinations, but does offer medical and nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal beliefs.

Full Story
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., including more than 113,000 deaths, in mid-June, as state governments considered how to prevent the spread of the disease in schools once a vaccine is available.
The state House of Representatives in Colorado — where child vaccination rates are among the lowest in the nation — passed the School Entry Immunization Bill, SB20-163, on June 10. The bill, which returned to the Senate for another vote, is aimed at increasing vaccination rates, and it formalizes the process for receiving a nonmedical exemption for an immunization.
But a meme circulating on Facebook and other versions on social media claim the bill does not give parents any opportunity to avoid vaccinations for their children.
""My heart is with Colorado!"" the meme reads. ""They passed bill SB-163 removing exemptions for vaccines. Very horrendous bill. Students must take Flu, HPV AND COVID19 vaccine to attend school."" The HPV vaccine protects against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers caused by human papillomavirus. 
That’s wrong on several counts.
First, the bill has not become law yet. As we noted, the current version must still be approved by the Colorado Senate and then be signed by the governor.
Also, the bill does not mention the HPV vaccine or the flu shot. It does not make any reference to COVID-19, and there is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, as we’ve reported.
It is also not true that the bill removes exemptions for vaccines or that ""students must take"" vaccines ""to attend school.""
Colorado state law currently requires any student under 18 to submit a certificate of immunization, a doctor-certified medical exemption, or a statement of religious or personal belief that bars immunization.
The new bill makes no changes as to who can choose to exempt their children and does not take away the opportunity to claim an exemption based on ""a religious belief whose teachings are opposed to immunizations or a personal belief that is opposed to immunizations.""
In cases where a student’s health would be harmed by an immunization, parents can seek a medical exemption signed by a physician, physical assistant, advanced practice nurse, or person authorized to administer immunizations to students.
The bill adds a new process for those seeking a nonmedical exemption due to religious or personal beliefs. It requires a parent, legal guardian, emancipated student, or student age 18 or older to submit a signed certificate of nonmedical exemption or a certificate of completion of an online education module — a state-produced video on vaccinations — administered by Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment.
The bill also sets a goal of 95% of the student population to be vaccinated and requires schools to publish their immunization and exemption rates for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Colorado currently has the lowest rate of immunization — 87.4% –in the country for the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC.

      Constitutional Experts: Trump Lacks Power to ‘Open Up the States’

		Constitutional experts say President Donald Trump is wrong that he, not governors, has the power to ""open up the states"" where businesses were closed or residents were ordered to stay at home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
On April 10, Trump said he would ""love to open"" the country by May 1 and that he is creating what he called an ""Opening Our Country"" task force, which will ""play a role"" in determining when businesses would be reopened. But, he said, ""ultimately, I have to make that decision.""
Several governors, however, said they would be making those kinds of determinations for their states, not the president. For example, on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" on April 12, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’d make any decision about easing coronavirus-related restrictions in her state.
""We’re going to make the decisions that safeguard New Mexicans,"" Lujan Grisham said. ""Everything we do is about protecting lives and first responders or health care workers.""
Lujan Grisham said she welcomed ""better national strategies,"" but, she added, ""I’m going to do whatever is right for New Mexico. And we’ve begun looking at recovery options but we aren’t going to do anything until that peak occurs and we’re clear about not having hospitalizations and reducing the number of people that are positive every day in our surveillance and testing efforts.""
Last month, when Trump said he wanted to have the country ""open for business"" by Easter on April 12, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said his state would not oblige.
""Whatever messages that are coming out of Washington, we are going to make sure we take care of the needs of New Hampshire first,"" Sununu, a Republican, said.
Since then, several news reports have concluded that, constitutionally, those decisions would ultimately be made by state governors, not Trump.
Via Twitter on April 13, Trump criticized the ""Fake News Media"" for ""saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect…. It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.""

….It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020

Later in the day, at a press briefing, Trump reiterated that he has the ""ultimate authority.""
""I’m going to put it very simply. The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful,"" he said. ""The president of the United States calls the shots.""
It’s unclear under what authority Trump is making his claim, and the White House did not clarify when we reached out to the press office. But constitutional experts disagree with him.
""The president is *not* correct,"" Robert Chesney, a professor of law and associate dean for academic affairs at the University of Texas School of Law, told us via email. (The emphasis is his.)
In a post for the Lawfare blog published on March 24, Chesney noted that the restrictions now in place ""flow primarily from rules promulgated by state governors, county commissioners and mayors — not from the federal government.""
""President Trump is wrong as a matter of constitutional law,"" Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law at the University of California, told us via email.
""Quarantine and stay-at-home orders are entirely the decision of the state governors,"" he said. ""States have the police power and the authority to quarantine. The President has no authority to override such orders and order the country open. No federal statute gives the President such authority. Nor did the President order sheltering in place; he can exhort, but the orders come from state and local governments.""
George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who served as an impeachment expert for House Republicans in December, told the New York Times, ""There is no authority for a president to order states to ‘open up’ if the state believes that such an order would be inimical to public health. The president had no authority to order a national lockdown and certainly does not have authority to now order the lifting of such orders issued by governors.""
According to the National Governors Association, 41 states have issued mandatory stay-at-home orders (in three other states it is a ""guidance""; in one, it is a ""recommendation,"" and in two other states the stay-at-home orders apply only to specific vulnerable populations); all states have closed schools; 41 states have prohibited in-person workforces at nonessential businesses; and almost every state has limited the operations of restaurants and bars.
When a reporter pointed out at the April 13 press conference that it was the states — not the federal government — that closed schools and ordered the closure of nonessential businesses, Trump responded, ""That’s because I let that happen, because I would’ve preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up.""
Writing for Politico, Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, explained that states and local governments are authorized to mandate such restrictions based on broad ""police power"" authority which ""can be traced to English common law and is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment.""
As a result, Joh wrote, ""State and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary.""
""The police power of the states has been invoked on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court, often in contrast to the limited powers of the federal government,"" Joh wrote, in a March 18 article.
In an interview on CNN on April 13, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association, said that governors would be discussing the wisdom of opening their states with ""multiple smart people at the federal level,"" such as Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
""We’d love to have the president’s cooperation."" Hogan added. ""But governors made decisions to take various actions in their states based on what they thought was right for their state, based on the facts on the ground, talking with doctors and scientists and I think individual governors who made those decisions will have the ultimate decision about what to do with their states.""
That doesn’t mean the president can’t influence things.
""The president, of course, is entitled to express his views on this point,"" Chesney said in his Lawfare post. That would have ""a significant practical effect"" on ""those who trust him,"" and as a result if the president were to speak against things like ""shelter-in-place"" rules, there’s likely to be a higher rate of noncompliance among ""citizens sympathetic to the president,"" he said. It also would likely put pressure on Republican leaders at the state and local level to adopt a similar position.
Trump appeared to reference that political power when he said, during a press conference on April 13, that ""if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election.""
But if some state and local officials buck the president’s call, Chesney said, ""the president cannot simply order state and local officials to change their policies.""
On March 16, Trump issued the 15-day ""Coronavirus Guidelines for America,"" in which he urged, ""all Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.""
On March 29, Trump announced that those guidelines would be extended to April 30.
But those were guidelines, not orders.
During a press briefing on April 10, Trump was asked about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis considering opening Florida schools in May. Trump said governors should make those decisions because ""from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done."" But Trump maintained that he had the right to overrule DeSantis if he disagreed.
Trump, April 10: I have a lot of confidence in Ron DeSantis, a lot of faith in Ron DeSantis to make the right decision. He’s doing a great job as governor. Ron DeSantis, I had read where he’s thinking about opening up the schools earlier than the date — the end of the month. I’d have to look at the numbers.
But again, you know, I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done. If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I’d rather have them — you can call it ""federalist,"" you can call it ""the Constitution,"" but I call it ""the Constitution."" I would rather have them make their decisions.
But he’s made a lot of good decisions. And he hasn’t said he’s going to, but he’s thinking about it. So I’ll take a look at it.
Chesney says Trump is wrong about that.
Chesney in Lawfare, March 24: Federal law is supreme over state law in our system. And so, if there is an otherwise-constitutional federal law compelling an outcome that runs contrary to a state or local rule, the federal law prevails. But it does not follow that President Trump can therefore override state and local rules on matters like shelter-in-place.
First, no currently existing statute plausibly can be read to confer such an authority on the president. The Stafford Act, the Defense Production Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the various statutes triggered by a declaration under the National Emergencies Act—none of these come close to authorizing something like this.
Second, there is little chance that this Congress is going to pass a statute that even purports to confer authority on the president to override state and local rules. I just do not see the House cooperating in such an effort.
Third, the president cannot plausibly claim inherent Article II authority to accomplish an override.
Article II in the Constitution establishes the powers of the president.
In an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, Chemerinsky said ""no federal law gives the president power to order businesses to close or, for that matter, to open.""
""Trump on his own lacks the power to act,"" Chemerinsky wrote. ""The president can exhort state and local governments to lift their restrictions. He can try to persuade businesses to open and defy the closure orders. He can ask Congress to pass legislation. But he cannot override state or local law, and he cannot provide immunity from sanctions to those who violate state and local restrictions. The bottom line is that if California, or other states, or cities or counties, feel the need to continue restrictions … they may do so.""
Six East Coast states and three West Coast states announced that they will work together jointly as regions on their reopening plans.
At his April 13 press briefing, Trump said he would provide the press ""a legal brief if you want"" on his ""ultimate authority,"" but none was immediately forthcoming. We followed up with the White House press office, but we got no response.


Presidential Emergency Action Documents
In an April 10 opinion piece published in the New York Times, Elizabeth Goitein and Andrew Boyle of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law discussed classified documents known as Presidential Emergency Action Documents.
""These documents consist of draft proclamations, executive orders and proposals for legislation that can be quickly deployed to assert broad presidential authority in a range of worst-case scenarios,"" Goitein and Boyle wrote. ""They are one of the government’s best-kept secrets. No presidential emergency action document has ever been released or even leaked. And it appears that none has ever been invoked.""
The Presidential Emergency Action Documents, or PEAD, were first created during the Eisenhower administration in the event of a nuclear war, they wrote. Since then, those plans have expanded to include responses to other national emergencies, including pandemics. They cited one 2004 declassified government memo that said, ""PEADs are used to implement extraordinary Presidential authority in response to extraordinary situations."" But the details of these documents have not been revealed publicly, even to members of Congress.
Asked about the comments by Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the April 13 press conference, Boyle told us it is ""certainly possible"" they were referring to those Presidential Emergency Action Documents.
For example, Trump said, ""This is when somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be."" And, ""The authority of the president of the United States having to do with the subject we’re talking about is total.""
Pence said he agreed: ""Well, make no mistake about it. In the long history of this country, the authority of the president of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. You can look back through times of war and other national emergencies.""
If the president and vice president are referring to Presidential Emergency Action Documents, Boyle told us in a phone interview it is ""highly questionable that these documents are consistent with constitutional law."" Boyle, counsel for the Brennan Center’s Liberty & National Security program, agrees with constitutional scholars who say, ""this is a power given to the states, not to the federal government.""
Nor does Boyle think the coronavirus pandemic meets the emergency threshold needed to trigger an attempt at such expanded executive powers. Unlike in a nuclear attack, he said, Congress and the courts are still functioning. ""There really is no legitimate claim in these circumstances,"" he said.
Chesney, director of the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin, told us the classified memos only amount to a legal opinion from lawyers at the Department of Justice, and that doesn’t make them legal.
""The executive branch has anticipated various nightmare scenarios, and — mindful that there wouldn’t be time for the usual drafting-and-vetting process in the teeth of catastrophe — someone pre-wrote a bunch of orders that a president in such a situation might want to issue,"" Chesney told us via email. ""We can assume there is some wild stuff in them, stuff that might be of very questionable legality in general, maybe even stuff that would be dubious even in the worst of circumstances.
""But the fact that someone has pre-written such documents does *nothing* to make the actions they describe more or less legal,"" Chesney added. ""At most, it means that someone at DOJ at some point reviewed the document and decided that, in the right (worst) fact patterns, the thing described in the document could be legal. That doesn’t actually make it legal, and it definitely doesn’t mean that today’s facts even match up with whatever scenario the document author had in mind.""
""So, let’s assume there is some pre-written emergency memo that purports to assert presidential authority over huge swaths of the economy, and Trump breaks the glass, signs it, and starts ordering various sectors to reopen despite state law to the contrary,"" Chesney continued. ""Does the president’s order control? The answer would be the same with or without the pre-written memo. (I think the answer would be no, incidentally).""
Boyle agrees, but says given the possibility that Trump could invoke the documents, ""Congress should insist on having full access to them to ensure that they are consistent with the Constitution and basic principles of democracy.""
It is also possible, Boyle said, the Trump administration, including those who have long held a ""robust view"" of executive power, would argue that with or without the memos, the president’s powers in certain circumstances are absolute.
If the administration has a legal argument for that, Boyle said, he’d like to see it. (Both Trump and Pence said the administration could provide such legal briefs.)
""Show us your work,"" Boyle said. ""Then we can have that debate.""

      Trump Campaign Takes Pelosi’s Words Out of Context

		House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an April 14 interview that the Paycheck Protection Program was ""very important,"" and with a second round of funding, she wanted to ""open this up to many more people,"" specifically the ""underbanked."" But that context is missing from a Trump campaign video.
The video, posted on Twitter by Brad Parscale, campaign manager for President Donald Trump’s reelection effort, leaves the false impression that Pelosi opposes replenishing funding for the small business loan program — a $349 billion coronavirus relief initiative that ran out of funding on April 16.
The video uses select quotes from Pelosi that appear to show her dismissing $250 billion in additional funding proposed by Republicans. But that’s not the whole story.

In the campaign video, Pelosi says: ""They asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours. I said, well, I don’t think so."" In the April 14 interview on MSNBC, however, Pelosi prefaced that remark by asking, ""Well, what happens to our underbanked folks?"" Her next sentence after the quote in the video: ""Let’s see how we can open this up to many more people.""
The video then shows on screen the words, ""Americans Are Losing Their Jobs,"" and Pelosi is heard saying, ""they objected and I congratulate the Senate Democrats."" In the interview, those comments aren’t made in succession. Instead, Pelosi said, ""I congratulate the Senate Democrats, they went to the floor when Mitch McConnell went in for his 250, and they said they objected."" Pelosi then said, ""And then they said, we have another proposal which opens the door to the underbanked.""
In the interview, Pelosi was asked by host Chris Hayes about Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s desire to pass a clean $250 billion bill that just provided additional funds for the Paycheck Protection Program.
Here are Pelosi’s remarks in context:
Hayes, MSNBC interview, April 14: Why do you not want to just do that? What is — what are your priorities for this next piece of legislation?
Pelosi: Well, let me say that CARES One — we’re getting ready for CARES Two, but CARES One was a bill that had many good features. We were successful working together House and Senate Democrats in changing it from the corporate trickle down bill to a worker’s first pull up bill. Part of it is a Paycheck Protection Program, which is very important.
However, I will not allow anything to perpetuate the disparity and access to capital that exists in our country. And so what they said, first come first serve, ‘Oh we’re just serving the customers that we know at the bank.’ Well, what happens to our underbanked folks? So last week, when they came, they asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours. I said, well, I don’t think so. Let’s see how we can open this up to many more people.
So Chuck Schumer and I, and this all happened on the Senate side, and I congratulate the Senate Democrats, they went to the floor when Mitch McConnell went in for his 250, and they said they objected. And then they said, we have another proposal which opens the door to the underbanked. There’s $60 billion, 10% of what they were asking for to be used for community development, financial institutions [that] know the neighborhood, know the language, know the culture, know the people, know the businesses to enable them to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program.
In addition to that, we still gave them half the money, $125 billion, but we use some other for this initiative, and also for the grant and other loan programs that benefited everyone. OK, so then we also said, while we’re at it what we desperately need is support for state and local government as well as for hospital. This is urgent. And they just said no. They only were going for the 250. We said, let’s negotiate. Let’s see how we can come to some conclusion that will benefit all of the needs, the underbanked, the hospitals, the state and local governments who are carrying enormous burdens.
And also the hospitals still talking about testing with the imperative for us to have the data, the racial data that is in there so that we see how this is affecting everyone in our community. So we were not going to let all this money that is spent because of the coronavirus crisis which is heartbreaking, the number of people who have died or others have lost their loved ones and the rest. But we could not allow the big money that was put to fight it to perpetuate disparity and access to capital and access to care.
The original $349 billion for the small business loan program was part of the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES, which Trump signed into law on March 27 and included other measures such as increased unemployment benefits, refundable tax credits and grants to states. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office explained that the paycheck protection loan program was designed to help businesses maintain their payrolls for eight weeks.
""The full principal amount and any accrued interest on a PPP loan may be forgiven, although that forgiveness will be diminished if a borrower either decreases the number of employees on its payroll or reduces employees’ compensation. Amounts that are not forgiven must be paid back to lenders within two years at an interest rate of 1 percent,"" CBO said in its analysis of the legislation.
The loan program proved so popular that it ran out of funding. A ""small business"" is defined as one with fewer than 500 employees, and restaurants with fewer than 500 workers per location met that definition. Some publicly traded companies secured millions in those loans, leading to criticism that it didn’t benefit the very small businesses that needed the money.
Shake Shack, which employs 8,000 in 189 restaurants, ended up returning the $10 million it had received, ""so that those restaurants who need it most can get it now,"" the founder and CEO said in a statement, explaining that the company was ""able to access the additional capital we needed to ensure our long term stability through an equity transaction in the public markets.""
Democrats and Republicans have disagreed over the need to include additional measures — more funding for states and hospitals, sought by Democrats — in new legislation that would add funds for the Paycheck Protection Program. In her weekly press conference on April 16, Pelosi reiterated what she had said in that April 14 MSNBC interview.
""We want to make sure that these people have access – everybody in the small business arena has access to credit,"" she said in the press conference. ""We do not want the billions of dollars spent in the CARES 1 Act, which we fully support, but we do not want it to perpetuate the disparity of access to credit for some of our businesses.""
Plus, she spoke of ""the need for us to have more funding for the hospitals and for the health – the state and local governments, whether talking about health care workers, police and fire, EMS, food delivery – all of that.""
The Trump campaign told us the video didn’t suggest that Pelosi had opposed the program overall, but that she supported delaying the funding in order to negotiate, a move Republicans clearly oppose. The campaign pointed to comments by Karen G. Mills, head of the Small Business Administration from 2009 to 2013, during the Obama administration, who said in an April 16 interview with Roll Call, ""Congress has to act as soon as possible.""
""Complexity is not our friend here,"" Roll Call quoted Mills as saying. ""Things that have to be implemented quickly can’t have a lot of bells and whistles, or else there will be too many unintended consequences — one of which is delay. And we don’t have time to delay.""
Zach Parkinson, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told us: ""It’s undeniable that Nancy Pelosi was proud of Democrats blocking more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program when American small businesses and workers desperately need a lifeline. While the Trump Administration successfully processed the equivalent of 14 years’ worth of paycheck loans in just 14 days, Pelosi’s opposition resulted in good, decent Americans getting hung out to dry.""
It’s a matter of opinion whether Democrats should have pushed to negotiate rather than agree to a $250 billion funding increase. But the video doesn’t make clear that Pelosi supported the Paycheck Protection Program overall. In fact, she said in the MSNBC interview that the Democrats ""fully support"" it.
The campaign video goes on to juxtapose clips of Pelosi on ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" showing off her stockpile of candy and ice cream with clips about Americans being out of work and having trouble affording food.
At one point, Pelosi is shown laughing and eating ice cream after a TV news anchor says, ""there are 22 million people out of work."" The president, and others, have criticized Pelosi for the optics of the ice cream segment at a time of economic hardship for many Americans. We leave it to readers to form their own opinions on that. But the editing of the video makes Pelosi appear indifferent to those out of work, contrary to her support for legislation to help those same people. 
On April 21, lawmakers and the White House reached a deal for $484 billion in funding, including $310  billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, with $60 billion of that specifically for community-based lenders and small- and medium-sized banks. A statement by Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the legislation included $50 billion more for SBA emergency disaster lending and also funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing.
The Senate passed the bill, and the president said on Twitter that he would sign it.
A day earlier, while negotiations were still ongoing, Trump touted the fact that the bipartisan compromise would include more than the $250 billion that the Republicans originally sought.
""Look, we’re getting the paycheck plan. It’s — already $350 billion was approved, essentially unanimously. And we have another 250, which I think you’re going to find out is going to be a higher number than that. Okay? I won’t say it now, because I don’t know if they’ve released it or not, but it’s going to end up being more than $250 billion,"" Trump said. ""And this is going to small businesses and it’s going to workers. And these are really bipartisan plans. It’s a great thing that’s happening. So I think the fact that we’re able to do all of this in a bipartisan way is great.""

      Kudlow’s Claim About COVID-19 Spread

		Despite early warnings about how damaging COVID-19 could be for Americans, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow defended his late February statement that the U.S. had ""contained"" the virus, saying on May 3 that the novel coronavirus ""spread exponentially in ways that virtually no one could have predicted.""
In just one example, news organizations reported that President Donald Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, wrote a memo in late January advising federal officials that the global outbreak could become a pandemic and that more than half a million Americans could die in multiple scenarios. Navarro then wrote another memo dated Feb. 23, saying the illness could claim the lives of 1 million to 2 million Americans, the news reports, which included images of the memos, said.
Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, made the claim May 3 in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" On the show, Kudlow defended having previously declared in a Feb. 25 CNBC interview that the U.S. had ""contained"" the coronavirus ""pretty close to airtight.""
Tapper, May 3: I guess the reason for the disconnect is that, sometimes, the people who understandably want to get the economy up and running have been saying things that contradict what some of the people who are health experts in the administration are saying.
For instance, at the end of February, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who apparently got in the doghouse for saying in a conference call — doghouse with President Trump — for saying in a conference call that it was not a matter of if, but when there would be a severe disruption to the American people and our way to live life, and that’s the same day, as you know, that you said this.
Let’s roll that tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
Kudlow: We have contained this, I won’t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight. We have done a good job in the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Tapper: So, I guess the question is, is there a disconnect between what people such as you, who want things to be better than they are, so as to help the economy, are saying and what people in the health field are saying?
Kudlow: Well, look, Jake, for the umpteenth time, I will say, my quote then was based on the actual facts, which, at the time, there were only 40 or 50 cases.
And it was contained, particularly after President Trump boldly put up travel restrictions with China. That’s what the data — I didn’t make a forecast.
So far — and that was just — there was hardly any cases, OK? Now, yes, some doctors were more fearful. Other doctors had many different things to say. I don’t want to get in and play this game who said what and when.
Political leaders, one well-known political leader in the House, went to Chinatown in San Francisco and said, everything is OK, OK?
One important anchor on your network as late as mid-March said, basically, the COVID-19 virus was no worse than an ordinary flu year. I mean, there are people saying — my quote was, at that time, there were very few cases.
Then, as the virus spread exponentially in ways that virtually no one could have predicted, of course, we changed our mind.
At the time of Kudlow’s Feb. 25 interview, there were 57 reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. and no known deaths. But, as we all now know, the virus that causes the illness was far from being ""contained"" in the country. (As of May 4, there were more than 1.15 million cases and over 67,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)
But it is inaccurate to say that, as of Feb. 25, ""virtually no one could have predicted"" such a widespread outbreak in the U.S. There were several people who predicted the virus could or would spread to become a pandemic — including members of Trump’s administration.
Jan. 28 — According to emails obtained by the New York Times, Carter Mecher, a senior medical adviser to the Department of Veterans Affairs, sent a note to several administration colleagues on Jan. 28 advocating closing schools, as well as colleges and universities, to prevent further transmission of the coronavirus. 
Mecher, Jan. 28: The chatter on the blogs is that WHO [World Health Organzation] and CDC are behind the curve. I’m seeing comments from people asking why WHO and CDC seem to be downplaying this. I’m certainly no public health expert (just a dufus from the VA), but no matter how I look at this, it looks [to] be bad. If we assume the same case ascertainment rate as the spring wave of 2009 H1N1, this looks nearly as transmissible as flu (but with a longer incubation period and greater Ro). The projected size of the outbreak already seems hard to believe, but when I think of the actions being taken across China that are reminiscent of 1918 Philadelphia [during the influenza pandemic], perhaps those numbers are correct. And if we accept that level of transmissibility, the CFR [case fatality rate] is approaching the range of a severe flu pandemic. But if we assume the case ascertainment rate is better than H1N1 and transmissibility is less than flu (it is still much more transmissible than SARS), and the CFR goes accordingly (1918 pandemic range). And if we assume the case ascertainment rate is even worse than 2009 H1N1, this is really unbelievable (higher transmissibility than flu). Any way you cut it, this is going to be bad. You guys made fun of me screaming to close the schools. Now I’m screaming, close the colleges and universities.


Jan. 29 — Navarro, who heads the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, wrote a memo — addressed to the National Security Council —  that looked at what might happen if the outbreak turned into a ""true pandemic."" In a worst-case scenario, Navarro said COVID-19 could lead to the loss of almost $6 trillion and the deaths of 543,000 Americans, according to the memo, published by the political website Axios.
Jan. 30 — Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar ""directly warned"" Trump ""of the possibility of a pandemic during a call … the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks,"" according to the Times.
Feb. 12 — Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it was inevitable COVID-19 would spread in the U.S. 
""Most of the disease is in China, however, we can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold in the U.S.,"" she said. ""The goal of the measures we have taken to date are to slow the introduction and impact of this disease in the United States, but at some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S. or other countries.""
Feb. 14 — According to the New York Times, HHS and National Security Council officials drafted a memo, dated Feb. 14 and titled ""U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"" that mentioned several ""quarantine and isolation measures"" that may be necessary to slow the spread of the virus in places where there is ""sustained human-to-human transmission."" 
Those tactics included: ""significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. … [S]chool closures. Widespread ‘stay at home’ directives from public and private organizations with nearly 100% telework for some.""
Also on Feb. 14, the Wall Street Journal quoted Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology, as saying: ""I think it is likely we’ll see a global pandemic. If a pandemic happens, 40% to 70% of people world-wide are likely to be infected in the coming year. What proportion of those will be symptomatic, I can’t give a good number.""
Feb. 21 — During a mock pandemic exercise, members of the White House coronavirus task force ""concluded they would soon need to move toward aggressive social distancing, even at the risk of severe disruption to the nation’s economy and the daily lives of millions of Americans,"" the New York Times would later report.
That same day, Messonnier said at a CDC briefing that ""it would be impossible"" to ""catch every traveler with coronavirus from China,"" so ""our goal continues to be slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S. This buys us more time to prepare our communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread.""
She warned, too, about possible school and business closings. ""[I]f you’re watching the news, you may be hearing about schools shutting down and businesses closing in countries in Asia to reduce the potential spread of this virus,"" Messonnier said. ""The day may come where we need to implement such measures in the U.S. communities.""
Feb. 23 — Navarro, according to Axios, wrote a second memo dated Feb. 23 and addressed to Trump, saying: ""There is an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.""
Feb. 24 — WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told countries to prepare for the global health emergency to become a pandemic. He said: ""Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet. … We must focus on containment, while doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic."" (On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak a global pandemic.) 
Feb. 25 — On the same day as Kudlow’s CNBC interview, Messonnier did say ""containment strategies"" in the U.S. ""have been largely successful."" But, she again cautioned that: ""Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country. It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.""
All of those warnings were made prior to, or the day of, Kudlow claiming the coronavirus had been ""contained.""
Furthermore, as we have written before, experts have long warned of a potentially catastrophic outbreak of global disease for which the U.S. might not be prepared.

      Trump’s Misleading Ventilator Counter-Punch at Cuomo

		Hitting back at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pleas for the federal government to provide more ventilators, President Donald Trump misleadingly claimed Cuomo rejected a 2015 recommendation to purchase 15,000 ventilators and instead ""established death panels"" and ""lotteries."" 
Contrary to the president’s claim, a task force in 2015 did not make a recommendation about purchasing more ventilators. The report — ""Ventilator Allocation Guidelines"" — provided guidelines for New York hospitals on how they should decide which patients get ventilators in the event of a severe influenza pandemic.
The coronavirus pandemic has exploded in New York, where nearly half of the more than 81,000 confirmed cases in the U.S. were located, as of March 26.
Cuomo said at a press conference on March 24 that the state had an urgent need for more ventilators to deal with an anticipated peak in demand in two weeks for patients needing help to breathe. The state will need at least 30,000 ventilators, he said, and it so far had obtained 7,000.
""There is no other way for us to get these ventilators,"" Cuomo said. ""We’ve tried everything else. The only way we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government. Period.""
Cuomo said the federal government had, to that point, only provided an additional 400 ventilators, though Vice President Mike Pence said in an interview on Fox News later that day that the federal government would be sending 4,000 more to New York in the next two days.
Cuomo ‘Rejected’ Ventilator Recommendation?
Speaking at a Fox News virtual town hall hours after Cuomo made his comments, Trump said that despite Cuomo’s ""complaining,"" the federal government was ""doing probably more — definitely more for [New York] — than anybody else.""
Trump said that while the federal government is and will continue to help New York, Cuomo ""is supposed to be buying his own ventilators."" 
While saying he was ""not blaming"" Cuomo for the shortage of ventilators, Trump added that in 2015 Cuomo ""refused to order 15,000 ventilators"" so ""he shouldn’t be talking about us.""
 Reading from an article on a conservative website, Trump said Cuomo ""rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for a pandemic"" and that he ""established death panels and lotteries instead."" 
Trump on Fox News, March 24: So he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down. I’m not blaming him or anything else, but he shouldn’t be talking about us. He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We’re going to help. …
We’re working very, very hard for the people of New York. We’re working along with him, and then I watch him on the show, complaining. And he had 16,000 ventilators that he could have had at a great price and he didn’t buy them.
That’s a misleading framing of an effort in 2015 in New York to provide guidelines for which patients should get ventilators in the event of a shortage during a severe pandemic.
But let’s unravel Trump’s comments a bit.
The president read directly from the headline of a story in the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, which originally stated, ""NY Gov. Cuomo Rejected Buying Recommended 16,000 Ventilators in 2015 for Pandemic, Established Death Panels and Lottery Instead.""
The article was about a syndicated column by Betsy McCaughey, a former Republican lieutenant governor of New York, who wrote:
McCaughey, March 18: After learning that the state’s stockpile of medical equipment had 16,000 fewer ventilators than New Yorkers would need in a severe pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo came to a fork in the road in 2015. He could have chosen to buy more ventilators. Instead, he asked his health commissioner, Howard Zucker to assemble a task force and draft rules for rationing the ventilators they already had.
That task force came up with rules that will be imposed when ventilators run short. Patients assigned a red code will have the highest access, and other patients will be assigned green, yellow or blue (the worst) depending on a ""triage officer’s"" decision. In truth, a death officer. Let’s not sugarcoat it. It won’t be up to your own doctor.
Cuomo could have purchased the additional 16,000 needed ventilators for $36,000 apiece or a total of $576 million in 2015. It’s a lot of money but less than the $750 million he threw away on a boondoggle ""Buffalo Billion"" solar panel factory. When it comes to state budget priorities, spending half a percent of the budget on ventilators is a no brainer.
McCaughey is referring to ""Ventilator Allocation Guidelines,"" a 272-page report produced by the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law and the New York State Department of Health in 2015. The group modeled the demands that would be placed on the New York health care system under moderate and severe influenza pandemic scenarios.
 The severe scenario was based on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The analysis concluded that during a severe influenza pandemic, there would likely be a shortfall of 15,783 ventilators during the peak week of demand.


Using the assumption that there would be a shortage of ventilators in a severe influenza pandemic, the task force created the guidelines to provide ""an ethical and clinical framework"" for deciding which patients would get one. The guidelines were ""crafted to provide the greatest benefit to as many patients as possible"" and to ""limit loss of life in the face of such a mass disaster,"" according to an FAQ section on the report.
But contrary to the president’s claim, the task force did not make a recommendation about purchasing more ventilators. That was outside the scope of the report, Valerie Gutmann Koch, the former senior attorney and special consultant to the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, told us via email.
Trump ""obviously didn’t read the document he’s citing,"" Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Cuomo, said in a statement to The Hill. ""This was a 5 year old advisory task force report, which never recommended the State procure ventilators — it merely referenced that New York wouldn’t be equipped with enough ventilators for a 1918 flu pandemic. No one is, including Mr. Trump.""
The report states that New York added 2,000 ventilators between 2007 — when the first draft guidelines were developed — and 2015, enough so that there would not be a shortage in the event of a moderate influenza pandemic. However, the report states, ""there are no current plans to buy enough ventilators for the most severe model.""
""The State’s current approach to stockpiling a limited number of ventilators balances the need to prepare for a potential pandemic against the need to maintain adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses,"" the report states. ""Furthermore, severe staffing shortages are anticipated, and purchasing additional ventilators beyond a threshold will not save additional lives, because there will not be a sufficient number of trained staff to operate them.""
In the FAQ section accompanying the report, the task force stated:
Q: Can the State stockpile as many ventilators as would be needed in a severe pandemic?
A: Even if New York State purchases additional ventilators, the demand would quickly outpace supply in a severe pandemic. No matter how many ventilators are available, in a severe pandemic there will be shortages because so many people will be sick at the same time. In addition, even with enough ventilators, a sufficient number of trained staff may not be available to operate them, particularly because health care workers will be among the ill.
Q: What can hospitals do to reduce the demand for ventilators in a pandemic?
A: Before the Guidelines are implemented, hospitals should practice ""surge capacity"" to reduce the need for ventilators. For example, elective procedures that require ventilators should be canceled and/or postponed during the period of emergency. For a moderate pandemic, surge capacity practices may be enough to meet the increased demand for ventilators. However, in the event of a severe pandemic, surge capacity measures would still fall short of addressing the anticipated demand for ventilators.
Asked in a press conference on March 25 about the task force and whether it had suggested New York should increase its stockpile of ventilators, Cuomo responded, ""that’s not the fact.""
""There was an advisory commission called … Life and the Law, that had a chart in 2015 that said, if you had the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, you may need ‘X’ number of ventilators,"" Cuomo said. ""There’s no state in the United States that bought ventilators for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The federal government did not buy ventilators for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Nobody in the world bought ventilators in preparation for a 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.""
Not mentioned by the president was that McCaughey, in the fuller op-ed that appeared in the New York Post, was also critical of the federal government’s preparedness.
Wrote McCaughey: ""To be fair, governments everywhere stockpiled too little. Washington didn’t do much better: The federal Strategic National Stockpile is undersupplied to meet the coronavirus emergency.""
Although the New York report did not explicitly recommend the purchase of additional ventilators, one of the task force members, Samuel Gorovitz, a philosophy professor at Syracuse University, told us via email that he wishes leaders at the time had reflected ""about the overall context"" of the report and decided additional purchases were ""a prudent thing to do.""
A New York Times analysis of the 2015 task force report and a study by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security concluded that New York has slightly fewer ventilators per capita than the national average.
Death Panels?
It’s also misleading to describe the triage committees overseeing the ventilator allocation guidelines as ""death panels.""
""I am clear that it [the 2015 report] did not recommend ‘death panels’ or anything that could plausibly be described that way,"" Gorovitz, who served on the task force, told us. ""Like the Covid-19 guidelines under development now, it anticipated the possible need to make tragic decisions. And if Gov. Cuomo had bought 20,000 ventilators in 2015, we would still need to be prepared to face and make such decisions. Better to be thoughtful about how to minimize their awfulness than to pretend the need can be avoided.""
""Death panels"" — a term the Gateway Pundit used to describe the New York guidelines and which was repeated by Trump — is a phrase that was popularized — misleadingly so — by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in 2009 to describe Medicare payments for end-of-life counseling by physicians as part of the then-proposed Affordable Care Act. Palin later used the term to criticize a panel created under the new health care law to slow the growth of Medicare spending, claiming, wrongly, that it would be used to ration health care.
Koch, the senior attorney for the task force who is currently the director of law and ethics at the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago and faculty fellow at DePaul University College of Law, also said it is inaccurate to call the triage committees proposed by the New York task force ""death panels.""
""The 2015 ventilator allocation protocol is intended to save the most lives in an influenza pandemic where there are a limited number of available ventilators,"" Koch told us. ""It is grounded in a solid ethical and legal foundation and balance the goal of saving the most lives with important societal values, such as protecting vulnerable populations, to build support from both the general public and health care staff. The recommendations are based on a number of important ethical principles, identified through years of deliberation and analysis, and with significant public outreach.
""The duty to steward resources is the need to responsibly manage resources during periods of true scarcity,"" Koch said. ""The duty to plan is the responsibility of government to plan for a foreseeable crisis. Distributive justice requires that an allocation system is applied broadly and consistently to be fair to all. Transparency ensures that the process of developing a clinical ventilator allocation protocol is open to feedback and revision, which helps promote public trust in the guidelines. The guidelines recommend triage officers/committees to implement the protocol in order to ensure fairness and equality. To ensure that patients receive the best care possible in a pandemic, the guidelines provide that a patient’s attending physician does not determine whether his/her patient receives or continues with ventilator therapy; instead, a triage officer or triage committee makes the decision.""
An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 23 advocated the nationwide development of ""strategies for rationing during pandemics"" and cited the New York task force’s efforts as an example.
""Though some people may denounce triage committees as ‘death panels,’ in fact they would be just the opposite — their goal would be to save the most lives possible in a time of unprecedented crisis,"" the authors wrote.
It is also inaccurate, Koch told us in an email, to describe the guidelines proposed by the task force as a ""lottery,"" as the headline Trump cited did.
Koch, March 25: The task force examined various nonclinical approaches to allocating ventilators. These included distributing ventilators on a first-come first-served basis, randomizing ventilator allocation (sometimes known as a lottery), requiring only informal clinical judgment in making decisions about ventilator allocation, and prioritizing certain patient categories, such as health care workers, older patients, and those with certain social criteria. The task force, however, rejected these methods, saying that they should not be used as the primary triage strategy because they are often subjective and/or do not support the goal of saving the most lives. Thus, it is wholly inaccurate to describe the guidelines as a lottery system. Rather, the allocation protocol uses only clinical factors to evaluate a patient’s likelihood of survival and determine his or her access to ventilator therapy. Under the Guidelines, under no circumstance will a decision regarding ventilator allocation be based on non-clinical factors such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, perceived quality of life, ability to pay, or role in the community.
The guidelines did envision using a lottery in limited circumstances. Although ""[a] patient’s likelihood of survival … is the most important consideration when evaluating a patient … there may be a situation where multiple patients have been assigned a red color code, which indicates they all have the highest level of access to ventilator therapy, and they all have equal (or near equal) likelihoods of survival."" 
""If the eligible patient pool consists of only adults or only children, a randomization process, such as a lottery, is used each time a ventilator becomes available because there are no other evidence–based clinical factors available to consider,"" the guidelines state. 
Low-Price Ventilators?
As for Trump’s claim that Cuomo in 2015 ""had a chance to buy"" 16,000 ventilators ""at a very low price,"" and that ""he had 16,000 ventilators that he could have had at a great price and he didn’t buy them,"" to be clear, there was no discount being offered for the purchase of 16,000 ventilators back in 2015.
The federal government also has a cache of ventilators in the CDC’s Strategic National Stockpile. The government does not publicize the contents of the federal stockpile, but Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery emeritus at the University of Cincinnati and the editor-in-chief of the journal Respiratory Care, told Politico there are believed to be around 20,000 ventilators in the national emergency stockpile.
Research published in Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2017 concluded that the number of ventilators in the national stockpile ""might not suffice to meet demand during a severe public health emergency."" The Wall Street Journal reported on March 23 that state officials in Washington and Massachusetts ""say they have received a fraction of what they sought from the national stockpile,"" including for medical equipment.
Using CDC estimates on the projected scope of the coronavirus pandemic, the authors of a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine projected that in the U.S. ""the number of patients needing ventilation could range between 1.4 and 31 patients per ventilator.""
""Whether it will be necessary to ration ventilators will depend on the pace of the pandemic and how many patients need ventilation at the same time, but many analysts warn that the risk is high,"" the authors wrote.
To sum up, while the task force report did highlight a shortage of ventilators in the event of a severe influenza pandemic, it did not recommend whether the state should buy more ventilators (and hire the staff necessary to operate them). And it is misleading to call those guidelines a ""death panel"" or ""lotteries.""

A controversial radio show host and blogger misrepresented findings of a published case report to conclude that an 86-year-old man died as a result of being vaccinated against COVID-19. The case report’s lead author said the man died of bacterial pneumonia and ""there was not any sign of vaccination side effect.""

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How effective are the vaccines?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How effective are the vaccines?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              All of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
According to the results of the phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. It’s important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial is typically somewhat lower. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found these two vaccines were 90% effective in real-world conditions, two weeks after the second dose, and 80% effective two weeks after the first dose. The study monitored 3,950 health care personnel, first responders and other essential workers for 13 weeks.   
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial began in late September, nearly two months after the Pfizer and Moderna trials and shortly before a new variant of the coronavirus emerged in South Africa. Globally, J&J reported an efficacy of 66.1% in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and an efficacy of 85.4% in preventing severe or critical COVID-19. But efficacy was higher in the U.S. population (72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease) than in South Africa (64% and 81.7% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe/critical disease, respectively).
Data from the Moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine probably does as well. But because so few participants in that trial developed severe COVID-19, this hasn’t yet been conclusively shown. The J&J trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 that would require medical intervention — meaning hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or a life support machine.
Although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease, what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus, and if not, whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) However, the CDC has said that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests those who are fully vaccinated are ""potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others.""

              Hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain — or no side effects at all. As the CDC has said, these vaccines ""have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.""
A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated.
As of Jan. 18, there have been 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those who develop anaphylaxis are usually given epinephrine, the drug found in EpiPens. None of these reactions has led to death. On Feb. 26, Johnson & Johnson said it had received a report of one anaphylactic reaction in South Africa.
To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn’t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, primarily in women ages 18 to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.
As of July 12, the syndrome has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine. There have been three deaths linked to the condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
In April, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use"" of the vaccine to investigate six reports of the syndrome out of more than 6.8 million immunizations. After a review, which turned up nine more cases, the CDC and FDA determined that the benefits still outweigh the risks and that the pause should be lifted. A warning was nevertheless added to the vaccine’s fact sheet and the CDC has said that women younger than 50 years old ""especially should be aware"" of the condition and that ""that there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen."" The condition is still rare among the highest-risk group, occurring in around 7 of every million vaccinated adult women below the age of 50.
On July 13, the FDA added warnings to fact sheets on the J&J vaccine about an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
The agency said the chance of developing the syndrome is ""very low"" but advised J&J vaccine recipients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms including weakness or tingling, particularly in the legs or arms; difficulty walking or with facial movement; double vision; or bladder control or bowel function issues.
The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases, with most people reporting symptoms within 42 days of vaccination. One death was reported, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine. The FDA said that each year 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome and most recover fully.
There is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men. In late June, after a review of safety monitoring data, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and the two conditions in teens and young adults.
As of July 12, the agency says there have been 1,047 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years old or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which are through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, are with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and are more common among males and after the second dose.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, the committee said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.""

              Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever.
Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain and chills. These reactions are more likely after the second dose of those vaccines, given several weeks after the first, and are more common and severe in younger people. The Johnson & Johnson side effects, too, were more common in 18- to 59-year-old participants, and also included nausea.
As the CDC explains, these common side effects are normal signs that your body is beginning to mount an immune response and the symptoms should go away within several days. Some people have no side effects, and that is normal, too.
Rarely, the COVID-19 vaccines may cause more serious problems. This includes a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which has occurred in 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated, according to the CDC, and, for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a blood clotting disorder coupled with low levels of platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). As of July 12, that issue, which has almost entirely affected women below the age of 50, has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine.
The FDA also has warned of an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome associated with the J&J vaccine. The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases including one reported death, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine.
Additionally, there is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men.

Full Story
A case report first published online in April was billed to be the ""first case of postmortem study in a patient vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2"" — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In the paper, the authors described the patient history of an 86-year-old male nursing home resident who died almost four weeks after he received his first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in early January.
For more than two weeks after vaccination, the man experienced no apparent symptoms but was hospitalized on the 18th day for worsening diarrhea. Seven days after hospitalization, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 — which he is believed to have contracted from his hospital roommate — and he died one day later.
Although the virus was detected in several of his vital organs upon examination, the authors said the man showed no signs of having COVID-19. They concluded the diarrhea had been caused by ischemic colitis, an inflammatory disease in the bowel, and the cause of death was bacterial pneumonia and renal failure.
The authors said the autopsy results ""might suggest that the first vaccination induces immunogenicity,"" or an immune response, ""but not sterile immunity,"" which is when the immune system is able to completely stop a virus from causing infection.


But some of the case report’s findings have since been misrepresented in a June 13 post headlined ""‘Global Time Bomb’ First case of postmortem study of patient vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2; ‘viral RNA found in every organ of the body.'"" 
The post — which has more than 8,000 shares on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data — was originally published by Hal Turner, a conservative internet radio talk show host and blogger, who has used white supremacist rhetoric and floated conspiracy theories.
""The vaccine, while triggering an immune response, DID NOT STOP the virus from entering every organ in the body,"" he emphasized. ""The viral RNA was found in virtually every organ in the body, which means the spike proteins as well.""
Turner, who acknowledged not being a doctor or scientist, said he consulted an infectious disease specialist in New Jersey who told him the autopsy findings indicate that everyone will eventually have adverse effects from being vaccinated, and that either the vaccine does not work or is causing the virus to spread faster in vaccinated people.
""This is a GLOBAL TIMEBOMB,"" Turner quoted the unnamed specialist saying.
Later in his post, Turner concluded that the vaccine led to the man’s death.
""If one reads the entire article, the whole story is: Patient was given the vaccine, it got him hospitalized with ulcerative colitis due to blood clots, during his hospitalization he got infected by an asymptomatic hospital room mate, and died 4 days later,"" Turner wrote. ""My conclusion: the jab drove this elderly man to his end.""
However, in a statement to FactCheck.org, the lead author of the case report said Turner got several facts wrong.

""The conclusions made by Turner based on our case report are absolutely misleading and in particular nearly always completely contradictory to our suggestions,"" said Dr. Torsten Hansen, who is with the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital OWL of Bielefeld University, Campus Lippe, in Detmold, Germany.
For starters, Hansen said the patient did not have vaccine-induced ""ulcerative colitis due to blood clots,"" as Turner claimed.
""The patient did not suffer from ulcerative colitis, but from ischemic colitis,"" Hansen explained.
Ischemic colitis occurs when the blood flow to the large intestine is temporarily reduced, causing tissue damage in the colon. In this case, Hansen said the patient had a history of ischemic colitis and suffered from ""severe arteriosclerosis,"" which restricts blood flow to organs and tissues.
""In specific regions of the bowel such as the left colonic flexure these vessels are particularly susceptible for vessel damage by arteriosclerosis. Subsequently, the respective part of the bowel develops inflammatory disease, called ischemic colitis,"" he told us.
""Moreover, in the patient’s history, we found a similar finding of ischemic colitis about 15 years ago (not described in the paper). In addition, we did not detect viral RNA in the tissue probes of the actual endoscopic investigation of the large bowel. Taken together, the ischemic colitis is the cause of the diarrhea and it is not induced by vaccination.""
In a follow-up email, Hansen said there ""was not any sign of vaccination side effect"" in the organs examined. He further stated that the patient died from bacterial pneumonia and that he and his coauthors ""believe that there was not any significant viral effect.""
""Our patient, though being positive for SARS CoV2 did not die from COVID19,"" he said, noting that Turner’s post incorrectly used the term COVID-19 to refer to both the virus and the disease. ""We suggest immune response due to vaccination was able to prevent COVID19.""
Hansen made three other points:

He said Turner ""completely ignored"" that the patient only received his first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and ""it is well known that immunogenicity against SARS CoV2 is fully established not before two weeks after the second vaccination.""
He said it is ""simply wrong"" that viral RNA was ""found in every organ"" of the patient’s body, as Turner’s post said multiple times. Hansen and his coauthors only analyzed nine organs known as pathways for viral spreading and detected virus in seven of them.


Finally, Hansen said the results of the autopsy case study have to be interpreted carefully because the case report is about a single patient — which makes it difficult to draw general conclusions about the vaccines. 

When notified that Hansen called Turner’s post a distortion of the case report, Turner — whose post conceded he ""might be wrong"" — stood by his own analysis.
""My story about ‘Global Time Bomb’ did not ‘distort’ anything,"" he told us in an email. ""My report came from the lead author’s report and my story provided a direct link to the full text for anyone to view themselves.""
Indeed, anyone who takes the time to read the complete case report of the patient history will likely notice its authors do not reach the same conclusions as Turner.

		Quick Take
A Facebook post is spreading the false claim that former President Barack Obama gave $3.8 million to a lab in Wuhan, China. The money referenced was actually provided to a U.S. research group. Only $600,000 went to the lab as part of a U.S.-approved collaboration. 


Full Story 
A post circulating on Facebook is spreading a debunked falsehood about U.S. funding that went to a lab in Wuhan, China — the city where the outbreak of the novel coronavirus began — as well as a false claim about the origins of the virus.
""President Trump just announced that the ‘biological’ lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was ‘funded’ by President Barak Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars,"" the post reads. It further claims, falsely, that ""this fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!""
The post, a text image, was uploaded as early as April but is continuing to spread.
First of all, the suggestion that the virus was ""created"" is a baseless conspiracy theory that we first wrote about in February. We’ve continued to debunk similar claims.
The post’s main claim about U.S. funding is one that we’ve also previously addressed.
The $3.8 million figure refers actually to a $3.4 million grant that the National Institutes of Health awarded to a U.S.-based group, EcoHealth Alliance. That group was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats and first received the grant in 2014.
Of that amount, EcoHealth gave $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a collaborator on the project that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department — Robert Kessler, EcoHealth’s spokesperson, previously told us.
The grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, Kessler said — and EcoHealth received $292,161 that year (part of the total $3.4 million it received). NIH terminated the grant in April.
President Donald Trump has also previously floated an unsupported claim that the amount received by the Wuhan lab was even higher — $7.5 million — and that he ""ended it."" But as we explained before, the grant that was discontinued was EcoHealth’s and the portion that went to the lab was $600,000.
A Fox News story in April also made reference to another $3.4 million NIH grant — regarding a behavioral study — and suggested that some of the funding may have gone to the Wuhan lab. (The story noted, however, that it was ""not clear exactly how much U.S. funding went directly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the American grants."")
But the recipient of that other grant, which was renewed this year — Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York — told us that wasn’t the case.
""[B]ased on CSHL’s records for its NIH R01 award MH101214, there is nothing to indicate that any money from this grant was provided to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Dagnia Zeidlickis, the lab’s vice president of communications, told us in an email.


Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for ""more investigation"" to determine how the pandemic began. ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,"" they wrote. ""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""
Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story ""The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus"" for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic.

		Quick Take
A false claim that students in Missouri will have to repeat the school year was pushed online through a viral letter with a state logo as part of an April Fool’s hoax. State officials have publicly debunked the claim.


Full Story 
A fictitious letter that circulated on Facebook as part of an apparent April Fool’s joke stirred confusion about whether students in the state would need to repeat the school year.
While many shared the phony letter in jest, the falsehood arrived amid the rapidly changing interruptions of everyday life in Missouri and across the U.S. as the country confronts the novel coronavirus outbreak. That combination worked to deceive some, apparently, and prompted state officials to publicly address the hoax.
The fake letter, dated April 1, claimed that ""Missouri case law on education makes it very clear that if students can not take the necessary final exams in a class room setting & they can not complete the curriculum that was established at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year no one enrolled in a public school in the state of Missouri can be allowed to be promoted to their next grade level.
""This means that whatever grade each of your students started at in August of 2019 will need to be repeated,"" it read.
The false claim was not unique — we wrote about a spate of similar April Fool’s headlines from a prank-generating website — but it went further by employing the official logo of the Missouri Department of Elementary & Secondary Education. The letter’s detail about final exams may have also been read as a reference to the department’s recent (actual) announcement to cancel statewide required assessments this year.
Mallory McGowin, a spokeswoman for the department, told us in an interview that the agency received multiple inquiries about the fake letter.
""We were getting approached by several different of our stakeholder groups inquiring about this or letting us know this was an issue unfolding pretty quickly,"" she said. ""Because of the current times, I think in some people’s minds, it seemed like it could be a logical conclusion from what’s been happening.""
""It seems particularly insensitive given the circumstances and given the anxiety and uncertainty that our students, parents and educators are already facing,"" she added. ""There’s really no room for that kind of misinformation to spread right now.""
The education department — and Gov. Mike Parson — took to social media to publicly debunk the letter.
""We could not be more disappointed that someone chose to use their free time to create this document, illegally using our department logo, and make a joke about something as serious as our students’ education,"" the department wrote in part.
One Missouri principal commented and thanked the department for ""clearing this up. I had parents very concerned. Not funny."" Other commenters deemed it an obvious April Fool’s prank and observed that the letter was signed by ""Candice B. Fureal"" (which sounds like ""can this be for real"").
As of now, all of the state’s 555 school districts and charter schools are closed. The earliest some are currently permitted to reopen is April 6, but that is likely to change as the state navigates the outbreak. The state has reported more than 1,800 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, which caused the COVID-19 disease, and 19 deaths.

		Quick Take
Social media posts are peddling the baseless claim that the first recipient of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom was actually a ""crisis actor."" There is no evidence for that conspiracy theory.

Full Story
On Dec. 8, a 90-year-old woman in England became the first recipient of a COVID-19 vaccine, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, following its approval for use in the United Kingdom.
But falsehoods attempting to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the moment, and on her identity, quickly followed.
On Facebook and Twitter, posts baselessly claimed that Margaret Keenan was actually a ""crisis actor.""
Such nonsense claims of ""actors"" being used in high-profile events aren’t new: We’ve debunked similar claims that followed the death of George Floyd and the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, for example.
A Dec. 9 Facebook post showed a photo of Keenan receiving the shot alongside a screenshot of a female actor’s listing on a talent website, and then another photo of a woman falling.
There is absolutely no evidence the women seen in the different photos are the same person, and the posts don’t offer any. Instead, they simply string photos of women together and present it as supposed proof for the wild conspiracy theory. There are noticeable differences between the women in the photos.
A reverse image search shows the last picture is of a woman falling during a September protest — which was against pandemic-related restrictions — in London. The photo is on Getty Images, and the caption does not identify the woman. Readers can compare that image to a photo of Keenan without a mask and to the actor’s photos.
Keenan received the shot at the University Hospital, Coventry in England and was discharged on Dec. 9. Multiple news outlets identified her as a grandmother nearing 91 and a former jewelry shop assistant. The National Health Service in England said Keenan was originally from Ireland and has lived in Coventry for more than 60 years.
Some posts, including a tweet from a well-followed conservative activist, also falsely suggested that the footage of Keenan receiving the shot had been used by CNN in October.
""Excuse me, but how is the exact same person who’s the ‘first to get vaccinated’ today…also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October?"" the tweet said. ""Which one of these lying stories did you want us to pretend is true?""
But CNN merely featured the video of Keenan receiving the shot, along with several other recent videos, at the top of an older story related to COVID-19. It’s not uncommon for news websites to feature newer videos on older pages.
Those who visit the Oct. 22 story — titled ""Faulty US Covid-19 response meant 130,000 to 210,000 avoidable deaths, report finds"" — can see the video including Keenan is in a carousel of several videos that were produced after the story in question. Archived versions of the same story — from Oct. 30, Nov. 1 and Nov. 3, for example — demonstrate that the videos featured at the top repeatedly change.
The claim doesn’t make sense for other reasons. The screenshot included in the tweet shows that the video of Keenan includes the headline ""UK Patients Now First in World to Get Authorized COVID Vaccine."" So the video was clearly using the footage to depict the first vaccinations.
Also, the video of Keenan lists the number of U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 as being more than 285,000; that number was reached this week. The death toll now stands at more than 290,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University as of Dec. 10.

		The second part of ""Plandemic"" — a documentary-style video that presents a sweeping conspiracy theory about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, patents and vaccines — landed on Aug. 18, spinning together many of the falsehoods about the disease that we’ve been debunking for months, plus some new misleading claims.
The 75-minute video expands on the first installment, which captured widespread attention in early May. At the time, much of the U.S. was under various stay-at-home orders in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus about two months after the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a pandemic. The first installment spread a number of false and misleading claims made by Judy Mikovits, a researcher known for her discredited work on chronic fatigue syndrome.
The new video, called ""Plandemic: Indoctornation,"" offers a more far-reaching conspiratorial take on the pandemic, with an underlying theme that the media can’t be trusted. It suggests without proof that the novel coronavirus was man-made and intentionally released.
The video is heavy on innuendo and features David Martin, a financial analyst and self-help entrepreneur who has a YouTube channel that has pushed some of the same conspiracy theories.
The first installment spread largely on major social media platforms, but many of them — including Facebook and YouTube — removed it for violating policies against harmful misinformation. Filmmaker Mikki Willis — a former model who has claimed on his YouTube channel that the novel coronavirus was ""intentionally released"" — has capitalized on that fact, telling viewers in a promotional video that it was ""the most banned documentary of all time.""
The sequel has been released on two video-hosting websites that bill themselves as being against ""censorship,"" promising to allow all videos to stay online, regardless of the claims they make. But each site includes a clause in the terms and conditions that allows them to remove content, similar to Facebook and YouTube.
So far, both sites appear to offer only videos uploaded by their creators — Brian Rose, who sells online self-help videos and promotes conspiracy theorists in England, and Ben Swann, an Atlanta-based content creator who is affiliated with the Russia-based, government-funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today. Swann has made other videos pushing conspiracy theories.
Promotion for the video was done largely on major social media platforms, though, where links to the video have been shared on pages with a combined following of more than 3 million, according to data from CrowdTangle.
We’ll address some of the major claims in the sections below:

The Event 201 Conspiracy Theory
David Martin and Patent Claims
Origins of the Virus
COVID-19 Vaccine Compensation
Out-of-Context Clip on Vaccine Timeline

The Event 201 Conspiracy Theory
The video devotes considerable attention to Event 201 — a tabletop preparedness exercise held in October 2019, before reports of the novel coronavirus in China surfaced in December. The event was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and World Economic Forum. We’ve written about it before — and information on the event, including videos, are publicly available.
The exercise brought together stakeholders from various sectors, including business and government, to simulate a ""severe pandemic"" involving a fictional coronavirus, with an outbreak beginning in Brazil.
The ""Plandemic"" video suggests a nefarious motive behind Event 201 and implies it is evidence for the video’s theory that the pandemic was planned. ""Nature conveniently backs itself into our architecture,"" Martin says. ""That’s the scenario we’re supposed to accept.""
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses, and experts have known of the pandemic threat posed by coronaviruses for years. So it’s not surprising to those who study such outbreaks that a preparedness exercise would have centered on a coronavirus.
Dr. Donald Burke, the Jonas Salk chair in population health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh, in a 1998 article discussing prevention of viral pandemics, warned that coronaviruses were among those that ""should be considered as serious threats to human health. These are viruses with high evolvability and proven ability to cause epidemics in animal populations.""
Burke, who at the time was a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, looked at how viruses jumped between animal species and how they evolve, among other factors. ""Coronaviruses had all the right tools in the tool kit"" to trigger a pandemic, Burke told us in a phone interview.
He was proven correct in 2003 by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
SARS is caused by another type of coronavirus, which, importantly, is different from the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Several different human viruses are included in the coronavirus group, ranging from those that cause the common cold to those that cause more severe illnesses, like SARS and COVID-19.
Burke said after the outbreak, infectious disease researchers — knowing that SARS could have been worse if it had been more transmissible — further recognized the threat presented by coronaviruses.
It’s ""downright sensible"" to have held preparation exercises on a potential coronavirus pandemic, he said. ""If you’re concerned about epidemic diseases, coronaviruses need to be high on your list — and thinking through what a coronavirus epidemic might look like.""
Dr. Eric Toner, senior scholar and senior scientist at the Center for Health Security, told us in a phone interview that the center ""chose coronavirus because it would be one of the believable pathogens other than flu."" He cited examples of other actual coronaviruses, like those that cause SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
The center has been hosting such exercises for nearly 20 years, he noted. In 2001, it hosted ""Dark Winter,"" which simulated a smallpox attack on U.S. citizens. In 2005, the center held ""Atlantic Storm,"" which involved a trans-Atlantic bioterrorist attack. In 2018, ""Clade X"" simulated a mock pandemic involving a novel virus without a vaccine.
The ""Plandemic"" video shows footage from Event 201 — with references to travel restrictions and misinformation, for example — next to footage taken during the actual pandemic about those same subjects.
But those specifics aren’t unique to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Toner, who was the project leader and principal author of Event 201’s storyline.
""Everything we wrote into the storyline are things that have happened over and over again in pandemics and epidemics,"" he said.
The 2018 Clade X simulation also involved considerations of travel bans. Toner said such travel limitations are a known government reflex.
The center began preparing for the event about 14 months ahead of time, Toner added, long before the novel coronavirus began spreading in China.
David Martin and Patent Claims
If Event 201 is the backbone of the conspiracy theory in ""Plandemic,"" then David Martin is the central character. He’s featured throughout the video, making claims primarily about patents.
Martin runs a company called M-CAM, which analyzes patents and intellectual property to estimate the investment value of companies.
M-CAM has five investment companies as clients, managing assets of $1.1 million, according to a recent statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
""Not big in investments, seems more like another guy using predictive modeling as a selling tool for many types of information,"" Suzanne Lynch told FactCheck.org in an email, after looking through M-CAM’s SEC filings. Lynch has worked on Wall Street and is now a professor of economic crime at Utica College.
Samuel Rosen, an assistant professor of finance at Temple University’s Fox School of Business, similarly described M-CAM, broadly, as an investment research company and noted in an email to FactCheck.org that it appears Martin manages a small hedge fund, too.
But Martin has also peddled conspiracy theories over the years. He published a novel in 2011, which he claimed was based on real events, alleging a rigged 2008 presidential election that was somehow tied to the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
Since the pandemic began, he has used his YouTube channel to promote COVID-19 conspiracy theories. He repeats many of those claims in ""Plandemic: Indoctornation.""

In one video from April, Martin referred to Event 201, saying: ""COVID-19 is a branded campaign … that is funded by people in the software, data sciences and social media industry. That’s who built COVID-19."" 
The gist of Martin’s video was that wealthy philanthropists like Bill Gates, technology companies, pharmaceutical companies and global health organizations colluded to create a virus that would force governments to fund research and development of vaccines and therapies in order to enrich themselves.
For ""Plandemic,"" though, Martin shifts his focus away from ""the software, data sciences and social media industry."" Instead, he takes aim largely at government entities.
Martin claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saw ""the possibility of a gold strike"" when the SARS epidemic arose in 2003.
""They saw that a virus they knew could be easily manipulated was something that was very valuable,"" he says, pointing to a patent filed by the CDC that year. The patent covered the isolated virus that causes SARS and ways to detect it.
Skimming across the screen while Martin makes that claim is a headline for a November 2003 news story about the race to patent the virus. However, that story doesn’t support his argument. It actually explains that the CDC wasn’t pursuing the patent for profit. Rather, it was doing so to keep others from monopolizing research.

""The whole purpose of the patent is to prevent folks from controlling the technology,"" the story quotes CDC spokesman Llelwyn Grant as saying. ""This is being done to give the industry and other researchers reasonable access to the samples.""
Similarly, the director of the CDC at the time, Dr. Julie Gerberding, told reporters that filing for the patent was ""a protective measure to make sure that the access to the virus remains open for everyone.""
""The concern that the federal government is looking at right now is that we could be locked out of this opportunity to work with this virus if it’s patented by someone else, and so by initiating steps to secure patent rights, we assure that we will be able to continue to make the virus and the products from the virus available in the public domain, and that we can continue to promote the rapid technological transfer of this biomedical information into tools and products that are useful to patients,"" Gerberding said in a May 2003 telebriefing.
So, Martin’s claim is at odds with the CDC’s publicly stated motivation, and he offers no evidence to support his argument.
Next, Martin claims that federal law wouldn’t have allowed for a patent on that isolated virus.
Again, he’s wrong.
Instead of reading from U.S. patent law, as he says he is in the video, Martin reads from a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision. That’s an important distinction since the decision, which changed one aspect of patent law that’s relevant here, came 10 years after the CDC filed for a patent related to the virus that causes SARS.
""Nature is prohibited from being patented,"" Martin says, claiming that he was quoting from a section of patent law. Building on that, he claims, ""either SARS, coronavirus, was manufactured, therefore making a patent on it legal, or it was natural, therefore making a patent on it illegal.""
But that’s a false dichotomy.
While the Supreme Court did find that ""[a] naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,"" that decision came a decade after the CDC sought the patent.
""Isolated genes (that is, genes extracted from a longer DNA sequence) used to be patentable in the past because the courts decided that just the act of extracting them and removing the non-coding segments caused enough of a modification to turn them into patent-eligible things,"" Mario Biagioli, a professor at UCLA School of Law, told FactCheck.org in an email. ""No more.  A few years ago the Supreme Court decided that simply isolating a gene did not change it enough. It remained a ‘product of nature’ and therefore unpatentable.""
So, claiming that the patent is either illegal or the virus was ""manufactured"" is wrong.
After that, Martin takes his claim one step further, saying: ""If it was manufactured, it was a violation of biological and chemical weapons treaties and laws. If it was natural, filing a patent on it was illegal. In either outcome, both are illegal.""
That’s not right, either, said Arti Rai, a professor at Duke University School of Law, in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.
In order for scientists to do research on either diseases or biological weapons, they need access to the underlying biological material and there are laws governing who can do that research and in what facilities, said Rai. It’s not necessarily illegal to possess such material.
Also, she noted, something that is illegal to use, like a chemical or biological weapon, isn’t illegal to patent.
""Lots of things have been patented over the years that would be illegal to use,"" said Rai. She gave the example of devices for taking illegal drugs, explaining that having a patent on something doesn’t give you the right to use it.
Altogether, the statements Martin makes about legal issues are inaccurate, Rai said, and the way the video presents connections related to those statements are inaccurate, too.
""They try to connect dots in a way that is misleading,"" she said.
It’s worth repeating, the 2003 patent filing Martin references involves a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19.
But he isn’t the first to make claims like this. Falsehoods tying unrelated patents to the novel coronavirus have been circulating almost as long as COVID-19 has been around. We wrote about some in January.
Origins of the Virus
After laying the groundwork by suggesting something nefarious was afoot with patents, the video goes on to claim that the novel coronavirus was designed in a lab.
It’s a reprise of one of the claims made by Mikovits in the first video installment, which we addressed then, and other versions of the claim have been circulating since the beginning of the year, which we’ve addressed, too.
While scientists don’t know exactly how the virus transmitted to humans, the consensus is that it was naturally occurring.
""Plandemic,"" however, highlights two people who don’t join that consensus. It first shows Dr. Meryl Nass, who is licensed to practice internal medicine in Maine. She campaigned earlier this year against a state law there that required children to be vaccinated. Voters upheld the law in a March referendum. The video then shows Luc Montagnier, who shared a Nobel Prize in 2008 for his contributions in identifying the virus known as HIV in 1983.
Montagnier’s cameo in ""Plandemic"" is short. Referring to the creation of the novel coronavirus, Willis, the filmmaker, says to him: ""You were quoted as saying, ‘it was a meticulous job, done professionally.'""
Montagnier responds: ""It could be done by somebody very expert in molecular biology, I think.""
The video then cuts to a clip of Montagnier’s appearance on a French news show. It doesn’t offer evidence to support the claim or give any further explanation of it.
Nass appears for a little longer, but she doesn’t offer any evidence to support her claims, either.
""I feel quite convinced that this is a laboratory-designed organism,"" Nass says.
But an article published in Nature Medicine in March found that the novel coronavirus ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.""
The authors said that the virus likely originated in one of two ways: ""natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,"" meaning before the spread of disease from animals to humans, or ""natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.""
The virus likely developed in bats before transferring to humans, either directly or through another animal, the World Health Organization explained in March. The CDC has released similar background information.
An accidental laboratory release of the naturally occurring virus can’t be ruled out, according to the Nature Medicine article, but the authors said they ""do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.""
Nass twice repeats her criticism that the article doesn’t ""hold water,"" but she provides no further explanation or evidence to support the claim that the virus was developed in a lab.
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for ""more investigation"" to determine how the pandemic began. ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,"" they wrote. ""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""
Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story ""The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus"" for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic. 
COVID-19 Vaccine Compensation
Near the end of ""Plandemic,"" the filmmakers raise the specter of safety concerns of a COVID-19 vaccine, and make the false claim that it’s ""basically impossible"" to get compensation if someone is injured from the vaccine.
""Something that people should know about COVID-19 vaccines is they fall today under the PREP Act, which came into being after 9/11 and after an anthrax scare,"" says Mary Holland, the vice chair and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, a prominent organization opposed to vaccination, in a talking-head interview in the video. ""And this law gives virtually blanket liability protection. It’s basically impossible to get any kind of compensation if you’re injured.""
She continues: ""So people need to understand that if you take COVID-19 vaccines, you are absolutely on your own. If you’re permanently injured, if you lose your job, if your health care expenses go through the roof — tough luck.""
Holland is correct that COVID-19 vaccines fall under the PREP Act, or Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005, which provides liability protection for vaccine makers and other companies involved in producing drugs or other products to aid in a pandemic response.
The liability protection is broad, although it does not extend to death or a serious physical injury that results from willful misconduct, as a Health and Human Services Q&A explains.
But Holland is wrong that it’s nearly impossible to get compensation for an injury. In fact, there is an entire system set up to provide compensation for those harmed by vaccines and other products in these scenarios, known as the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, or CICP.
""It is not accurate to say that one cannot get any form of compensation for serious injuries/death resulting from a COVID-19 vaccine, as the CICP is available to provide compensation for countermeasures used in response to public health emergencies and threats, and a covered countermeasure is defined to include vaccines, such as a COVID-19 vaccine,"" Eva F. Yin, an associate with the law firm Wilson Sonsini and author of a client advisory about the PREP Act and COVID-19, told us in an email.
According to a Health Resources & Services Administration fact sheet, the program has been in place since 2010, and compensation ""may include unreimbursed medical expenses (expenses that health insurance did not cover), lost employment income, and the survivor death benefit.""
A Congressional Research Service report explains that for COVID-19, both the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act appropriate funding that can be used by the compensation program. The report, which mentions the compensation program numerous times, is the same congressional report that the video flashes on screen while Holland makes her false claim.
HRSA spokesman David Bowman told us that people have a year to submit a claim, which is reviewed by medical staff to determine if the individual experienced a covered injury. The decision, he said, is based on ""compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence.""
Bowman said the program covers COVID-19 vaccines used in clinical trials. Since its inception in 2010, CICP has paid out a total of $5.7 million for 39 claims.
Most non-pandemic vaccines are covered by a different program, also administered by HRSA, known as the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
Out-of-Context Clip on Vaccine Timeline
Shortly before the compensation claim, the video also features a clip from a ""60 Minutes Australia"" episode that aired in May and questioned the feasibility and timing of a coronavirus vaccine. 
A voiceover declares a vaccine to be a ""great hope,"" and asks, ""But are we being sold a lie? After all, COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to strike mankind, and we’ve never found a vaccine for any of them.""
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, so it isn’t a coronavirus itself. SARS-CoV-2 is indeed the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans. But four of the human coronaviruses are mild viruses that typically cause cold-like illnesses that are not particularly worth vaccinating against.
The two others are those that cause SARS or MERS. But just because there haven’t been licensed vaccines targeting those viruses doesn’t mean prospects are bad for SARS-CoV-2. 
As Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, explained in a Medscape article, scientists did work on creating a SARS vaccine — but interest and funding fell through once it became clear that the epidemic had been contained. For MERS, the primary hurdle for vaccine development is similar, since outbreaks of the disease are uncommon.
""[G]iven the relatively low incidence even in high-risk groups (camel workers, their families, healthcare workers),"" she wrote of a MERS vaccine, ""trials could need 100,000-plus participants, which isn’t feasible. As a result, there still isn’t a clear path forward for testing a vaccine and getting it approved by regulators.""
The situation with COVID-19 is quite different. Not only has SARS-CoV-2 not been contained in much of the world, but the world is clamoring for a vaccine. More than 160 vaccines are being pursued, according to the WHO.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has explained before that while there is no guarantee of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, there is no reason to think a vaccine cannot be developed, as the coronavirus elicits an immune response and the results from early-phase clinical trials have been positive.
In the ""60 Minutes Australia"" segment, New York University School of Medicine bioethicist Arthur Caplan is heard saying, ""The shortest time anybody’s ever found a vaccine against any disease that I’m familiar with is about seven years. The average time is 20. To be talking about a magic bullet coming in months, it borders on the absurd.""
Caplan, who supports vaccines and has argued for transparency around a COVID-19 vaccine, told us in a phone interview that his appearance in the ""Plandemic"" video was not sanctioned.
""I think the video is pure anti-vaccine propaganda. The clip of me is completely out of context. They could have asked me if they wanted my views,"" he said. ""But they didn’t.""
""What I was trying to get across was that we shouldn’t plan on having a vaccine soon, despite some rosy pronouncements from the president and some others,"" he said. ""And that we better be prepared to continue our social distancing, masking, testing, hand hygiene [and] improving ventilation well into next year.""
A vaccine, Caplan added, ""would be a real tool, but it’s not going to replace or eliminate the need for behavioral modifications in dealing with the virus.""
The fastest time for vaccine development is actually four years, not seven, Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia told us in an email. Vaccinologist Maurice Hilleman isolated the mumps virus from his daughter in 1963, which led to the licensed Mumpsvax vaccine in 1967. It is still used today as part of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine. 
According to the CDC’s Pink Book, a textbook covering the epidemiology and prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases, there was an earlier mumps vaccine that took just three years to develop, but it wasn’t as effective and was discontinued in the mid-1970s.
Caplan said when he estimated seven years, he was sharing what he was aware of at the time.

		Quick Take
A viral post disguised as a TV news report falsely claims that crab legs have been contaminated with the novel coronavirus. The pandemic has affected the flow of seafood from foreign markets, but crab is safe to eat.

Full Story
A viral Facebook post falsely claims that crab legs have been found to be contaminated with the coronavirus. The meme, which has been circulating on social media as a ""screenshot"" of television news, actually comes from a bogus news-generating app. The original post has since been deleted, but the meme and its misinformation have continued to circulate.
The news ""screenshot"" shows an image of crab legs behind the ""BREAKING NEWS"" headline: ""CORONA VIRUS HAD BEEN FOUND IN CRAB LEG."" The news chyron (the text on the lower portion of the image) also declares that ""The Virus Has Now Been Found in Crab Lega Studies Say.""
As the website Lead Stories found, the ""screenshot"" is actually the product of an app called News Maker. The app allows users to generate ""your own realistic, television-style news screenshots using your own photos and your own creative headlines."" We checked and matched the visual components of the screenshot image, such as the ""6 News"" logo, blue background, and chyron style, to the app.
The chyron’s text contains typos and grammatical errors, suggesting it wasn’t made by a media outlet. For example, legs are spelled ""lega,"" and ""corona virus"" is incorrectly spelled as two words.
Furthermore, the claim that crab has been found to be contaminated with the coronavirus is unfounded. A February press release from the Food and Drug Administration states, ""Again, we want to reassure the public that at this time there is no evidence that food or food packaging have been associated with transmission [of coronavirus] and no reason to be concerned.""
In a Q&A article on COVID-19, the World Health Organization states that ""[t]he likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.""
The WHO also advises that ""when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.""
These are normal seafood safety precautions, Forbes reports. Recent travel advisories have led the FDA to announce that it is ""postponing most foreign inspections through April, effective immediately"" while maintaining ""oversight over international manufacturers and imported products using alternative tools and methods … which have proved effective in the past.""
That’s not to say that the coronavirus pandemic and travel restrictions will not affect seafood supply chains. Import restrictions and a lockdown on domestic travel in Italy, France and Spain have caused seafood suppliers to shut down due to the lack of foreign demand. Forbes reports that many people are opting to order frozen and processed seafood products online instead of getting fresh products at markets, citing this article on the Chinese seafood market.
Regardless of how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the global seafood supply chain, crab legs — and seafood products — have not been found to be contaminated with the virus.

		1.7KPresident Donald Trump has made a number of misleading statements about his decision on Jan. 31 to impose travel restrictions related to the novel coronavirus epidemic.

Trump has referred to the travel restrictions as a ""travel ban."" There isn’t an outright ban, as there are exceptions, including for Americans and their family members.
Trump said he was ""bold"" in imposing travel restrictions even though ""everybody said, it’s too early, it’s too soon"" and ""a lot of people that work on this stuff almost exclusively"" told him ""don’t do it."" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the decision stemmed from ""the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.""
Trump said Democrats ""loudly criticized and protested"" his announced travel restrictions, and that they ""called me a racist because I made that decision."" Trump is overstating Democratic opposition. None of the party’s congressional leaders and none of the Democratic candidates running for president have directly criticized that decision, though at least two Democrats have.
Trump said the travel restrictions ""saved a lot of lives"" and reduced U.S. COVID-19 cases to ""a very small number."" But experts say there isn’t enough data to make that determination. A study in the journal Science found the various travel limitations across the globe initially helped to slow the spread, but the number of cases worldwide rose anyway because the virus had already begun traveling undetected internationally.



Azar declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus on Jan. 31, and announced the travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. On Feb. 29, Trump expanded those travel restrictions to Iran. Trump has repeatedly boasted that his decision to impose the travel restrictions was bold and worked. But his rhetoric has sometimes stretched the facts.
A Travel ‘Ban’?
For starters, health experts say Trump was wrong to refer to the travel restrictions as a ""travel ban,"" as he did in a telephone interview on March 4 with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. During a town hall on March 5, Trump said he ""closed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected."" That’s not accurate.
As Azar explained when he announced the travel restrictions on Jan. 31, the policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.
At a House subcommittee hearing on the coronavirus on Feb. 5, Ron Klain, White House Ebola response coordinator under the Obama administration, took issue with the characterization of the travel restrictions as a travel ""ban.""


""We don’t have a travel ban,"" Klain said. ""We have a travel Band-Aid right now. First, before it was imposed, 300,000 people came here from China in the previous month. So, the horse is out of the barn.""
""There’s no restriction on Americans going back and forth,"" Klain said. ""There are warnings. People should abide by those warnings. But today, 30 planes will land in Los Angeles that either originated in Beijing or came here on one-stops, 30 in San Francisco, 25 in New York City. Okay? So, unless we think that the color of the passport someone carries is a meaningful public health restriction, we have not placed a meaningful public health restriction.""
Indeed, on Jan. 24, a week before the travel restrictions, the CDC confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. from people who had returned from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began.
Furthermore, Klain said, the import of goods from China is exempt from the travel restrictions, ""and, of course, the people who fly the planes and drive the boats that bring those goods from China. We couldn’t ban that activity. We vitally need that. Ninety percent of the antibiotics in this country come from China. All kinds of vital medical supplies … we will use to treat people. So, travel bans … that’s not what we’re imposing, that’s not what exists.""
As part of the travel restrictions, Azar announced that any U.S. citizen returning to the U.S. who had been in Hubei Province in China in the previous 14 days would be subject to mandatory quarantine and health screening. U.S. citizens returning from mainland China outside Hubei Province were ordered to undergo health screenings and ""up to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they’ve not contracted the virus and do not pose a public health risk,"" Azar said.
At the time the restrictions were announced, there were only six confirmed cases of the novel virus in the U.S. The outbreak, which began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, has now spread to more than 70 countries, including the U.S. According to a Johns Hopkins University case tracker and a New York Times database, as of March 6, more than 250 people in the U.S. have been infected with the new disease, known as COVID-19, and at least 14 have died.
Did Trump Buck the Experts?
Trump has repeatedly said that his decision to impose the travel restrictions on Jan. 31 was made despite objections from most of the experts on containing the spread of infectious disease.
""But we closed those borders very early, against the advice of a lot of professionals, and we turned out to be right. I took a lot of heat for that,"" Trump said on March 4.
Asked by Hannity the same day about his rationale at the time he made the decision, Trump said, ""I would say everybody said, it’s too early, it’s too soon, and good people, brilliant people, in many ways, doctors and lawyers and, frankly, a lot of people that work on this stuff almost exclusively. And they said, don’t do it.""
Trump repeated this claim at his town hall in Scranton on March 5, saying that as soon as he heard that China had a problem with the coronavirus, he asked how many people the U.S. had coming in from China. ""Nobody but me asked that question,"" Trump said. Trump added that his decision to impose the travel restrictions was made ""against the advice of almost everybody.""
Everybody? Not according to Azar, who said it was the ""uniform"" recommendation of experts in his department.
""The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,"" Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. ""These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.""
The World Health Organization cautioned against the overuse of travel restrictions, but stopped short of saying that Trump’s decision in the U.S.  — or anyone else’s in other countries — was inappropriate.
""[W]e reiterate our call to all countries not to impose restrictions inconsistent with the International Health Regulations,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told its executive board. ""Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit. So far, 22 countries have reported such restrictions to WHO. Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.""
As we said, three experts called by Democrats at a House subcommittee hearing on Feb. 5 questioned the decision. Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, was one of them.


Nuzzo, Feb. 5: [W]e need to seriously reexamine the current policy of banning travel from China and quarantining returning travelers. All of the evidence we have indicates that travel restrictions and quarantines directed at individual countries are unlikely to keep the virus out of our borders. These measures may exacerbate the epidemic’s social and economic tolls and can make us less safe. Simply put, this virus is spreading too quickly and too silently, and our surveillance is too limited for us to truly know which countries have active transmission and which don’t. The virus could enter the U.S. from other parts of the world not on our restricted list, and it may already be circulating here.
The U.S. was a target of travel bans and quarantines during the 2009 flu pandemic. It didn’t work to stop the spread, and it hurt our country. I am concerned that by our singling out China for travel bans, we are effectively penalizing it for reporting cases. This may diminish its willingness to further share data and chill other countries’ willingness to be transparent about their own outbreaks. Travel bans and quarantines will make us less safe if they divert attention and resources from higher priority disease mitigation approaches that we know are needed to respond to cases within the United States.
… We often see, when we have emerging disease outbreaks, our first instinct is to try to lock down travel to prevent the introduction of virus to our country. And that is a completely understandable instinct. I have never seen instances in which that has worked when we are talking about a virus at this scale.
Respiratory viruses like this one, unlike others–they just move quickly. They are hard to spot because they look like many other diseases. It’s very difficult to interrupt them at borders. You would need to have complete surveillance in order to do that. And we simply don’t have that.
During the hearing, Dr. Jennifer Bouey, chair of China policy studies at the Rand Corporation, agreed saying that the policy to restrict travel ""doesn’t help that much in this–the current situation.""
But according to Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, those kinds of opinions were in the minority at the time the president made his decision.
""I don’t know anyone who thought the travel restrictions were a bad idea early on,"" Offit told us in a phone interview.
When a virus like that is restricted to one location, as it appeared to be early on, travel restrictions can lessen the odds of it spreading to this country, Offit said. Over time, however, and as cases began to be identified in the U.S., travel restrictions make much less of a difference, he said.
Epidemiologists and former U.S. health officials told Time that the initial travel restrictions were valid and ""likely helped to slow the spread of the virus. The problem, they say, is that once it was clear that the virus was within our borders officials did not pivot quickly enough to changing circumstances.""
Democratic Criticism
Trump has repeatedly claimed that Democrats have ""loudly criticized and protested"" his imposition of the travel restrictions, and have called the decision ""racist."" But while leading Democrats have been outspoken in their criticism of the president’s overall response to the epidemic, very few have criticized his decision to impose limited travel restrictions.
""I took a lot of heat,"" Trump said during a Feb. 27 press conference. ""I mean, some people called me racist because I made a decision so early. And we had never done that as a country before, let alone early. So it was a, you know, bold decision. It turned out to be a good decision. But I was criticized by the Democrats. They called me a racist because I made that decision, if you can believe that one.""
At a rally in South Carolina the following day, Trump said Democrats ""loudly criticized and protested"" his decision.
""But, anyway — but we’ve done an incredible job because we closed early,"" Trump said in a meeting with African American leaders on Feb. 28. ""And actually, the Democrats said I was a racist. Not from black-people standpoint, but from Asian-people standpoint, from Chinese-people standpoint. They said I was a racist because I closed our country to people coming in from certain areas. They called me a racist.""
We reached out to the Trump campaign and asked for names, but we did not get a response. We scoured news clips and could find only a couple instances of elected Democrats criticizing the president’s action to restrict travel.
In the House subcommittee hearing on Feb. 5 that we referenced earlier, several witnesses called by the Democrats expressed concerns about the travel restrictions and warned they could do more harm than good.
And at least one Democrat agreed.
""The United States and other countries around the world have put in place unprecedented travel restrictions in response to the virus,"" said Democratic Rep. Eliot L. Engel. ""These measures have not proven to improve public health outcomes, rather they tend to cause economic harm and to stoke racist and discriminatory responses to this epidemic.""
A day earlier, Democratic Rep. Ami Bera, who presided over the hearing, told Politico, ""In our response we can’t create prejudices and harbor anxieties toward one population."" Bera told Politico the decision to impose travel restrictions ""probably doesn’t make sense"" given that the outbreak had already spread to several other countries by that point. ""At this juncture, it’s going to be very hard to contain the virus,"" Bera said.
But the Democratic leaders in Congress have simply not mentioned Trump’s travel restrictions.
In a Feb. 25 tweet, Trump claimed that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ""didn’t like my early travel closings."" Trump’s comment appears to be based on a fabricated tweet that circulated widely on Facebook.
Schumer has been critical of the Trump administration’s response to the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he hasn’t mentioned the travel restrictions in that criticism.
In Trump’s Fox News interview on March 4, host Sean Hannity said former vice president and current Democratic challenger Joe Biden ""accused the president of being xenophobic, while he was trying to protect the health of the American people.""
On the day Trump imposed the travel restrictions, Biden did criticize Trump for his ""record of hysteria and xenophobia,"" but it is unclear whether Biden was referring to Trump’s travel restrictions, or Trump’s overall qualifications to deal with the epidemic.
""We have right now a crisis with the coronavirus, emanating from China,"" Biden said on Jan. 31 at a campaign event in Iowa. ""A national emergency worldwide alerts. The American people need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. In moments like this, this is where the credibility of the president is most needed, as he explains what we should and should not do. This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.""


In an op-ed published several days prior in USA Today, Biden similarly argued: ""The possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president."" Biden wrote that he recalled ""how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma during the 2014 Ebola epidemic."" Trump, Biden wrote, ""railed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place — which quelled the crisis and saved hundreds of thousands of lives — in favor of reactionary travel bans that would only have made things worse.""
Although Democratic leaders and Democratic presidential candidates have been highly critical of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, we couldn’t find any examples of them directly and clearly criticizing the travel restrictions.
In a Feb. 4 letter to Trump, Democratic Reps. Nita Lowey, chair of the Appropriations Committee, and Rose DeLauro, chair of one of the subcommittees, wrote that they ""strongly support"" the president’s decision to declare a public health emergency in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, and they specifically cited the administration’s actions to impose ""significant travel restrictions.""
Have Travel Restrictions ‘Saved a Lot of Lives’?
Trump said his ""bold"" decision has since been vindicated, that it has ""saved a lot of lives"" and that because of his decision ""that’s why we have a very small number of people that we have to really worry about.""
At a press conference on Feb. 29 attended by Trump, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, praised ""the original decision that was made by the president"" to impose travel restrictions to and from China.
""We prevented travel from China to the United States,"" said Fauci, who has worked for multiple administrations. ""If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.""
But not everyone agrees.
Nuzzo, the senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said there’s no evidence, at least, that the travel restrictions have saved lives or reduced the number of cases in the U.S.
""We have not seen any evidence that shows the travel restrictions stopped or slowed down transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19,"" Nuzzo told us via email. ""It is possible that it did, but there is no evidence to show this. Rather there are a number of reasons to believe that this may very well not be the case.""
Chiefly, she said, that’s because ""we weren’t seriously looking for cases in the US.""
""If you had mild infection, you were not tested,"" Nuzzo said. ""If you had viral pneumonia not requiring oxygen but had not been to Wuhan, you wouldn’t have been tested.""
""Prior to the US travel restrictions, China began suspending outbound flights,"" Nuzzo said. ""Airlines also began canceling flights due to low travel volume. Then, the US implemented travel restrictions, which further reduced travel from China. The exception was Americans who were returning home from China. These folks were subject to quarantine upon return. A number of cases were found among these individuals. If you only test travelers from China and you greatly reduce the number of travelers coming from China, then you would be likely to not find many cases.
""But it doesn’t mean the virus hadn’t entered the US prior to travel restrictions,"" Nuzzo said, as data now suggests occurred in Washington state.
Also, she said other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren’t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. ""would likely not have picked it up"" if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries ""because we weren’t using these other countries as criteria for testing.""
A modeling study published in Science magazine on March 6, ""The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,"" concluded that, ""In areas affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), travel restrictions will only modestly impact the spread of the outbreak,"" according to a press release for the study.
""Based on the study’s results, the authors say the greatest benefit to mitigating the epidemic will come from public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility – factors like early detection, isolation, and handwashing,"" according to the press release.
The authors concluded that travel restrictions introduced by the Chinese government in Wuhan in Jan. 23  and the halting of airline flights to and from China starting in early February at first slowed the spread of the disease to the rest of the world. Even still, a large number of individuals exposed to the virus had been traveling internationally without being detected and, the authors note, the number of imported cases around the world went up in a matter of weeks.
""Moving forward we expect that travel restrictions to COVID-19 affected areas will have modest effects, and that transmission-reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic,"" the authors wrote.

A new study found there was no negative effect on sperm levels in men after receiving the COVID-19 vaccines, undercutting suggestions that the shots affect male fertility. But social media posts have made the baseless claim that vaccinated men ""are effectively sterile.""

              Hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in the U.S. and only a few, very rare, safety concerns have emerged. The vast majority of people experience only minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle pain — or no side effects at all. As the CDC has said, these vaccines ""have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.""
A small number of severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis, which are expected with any vaccine, have occurred with the authorized COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions are rare, typically occur within minutes of inoculation and can be treated.
As of Jan. 18, there have been 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those who develop anaphylaxis are usually given epinephrine, the drug found in EpiPens. None of these reactions has led to death. On Feb. 26, Johnson & Johnson said it had received a report of one anaphylactic reaction in South Africa.
To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour. People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients should not be immunized. Also, those who shouldn’t receive one type of COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving a different type of vaccine.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, primarily in women ages 18 to 49. Early symptoms of the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, can appear as late as three weeks after vaccination and include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, leg swelling, and easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin outside of the injection site.
As of July 12, the syndrome has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine. There have been three deaths linked to the condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
In April, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use"" of the vaccine to investigate six reports of the syndrome out of more than 6.8 million immunizations. After a review, which turned up nine more cases, the CDC and FDA determined that the benefits still outweigh the risks and that the pause should be lifted. A warning was nevertheless added to the vaccine’s fact sheet and the CDC has said that women younger than 50 years old ""especially should be aware"" of the condition and that ""that there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen."" The condition is still rare among the highest-risk group, occurring in around 7 of every million vaccinated adult women below the age of 50.
On July 13, the FDA added warnings to fact sheets on the J&J vaccine about an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
The agency said the chance of developing the syndrome is ""very low"" but advised J&J vaccine recipients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms including weakness or tingling, particularly in the legs or arms; difficulty walking or with facial movement; double vision; or bladder control or bowel function issues.
The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases, with most people reporting symptoms within 42 days of vaccination. One death was reported, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine. The FDA said that each year 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome and most recover fully.
There is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men. In late June, after a review of safety monitoring data, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a ""likely association"" between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and the two conditions in teens and young adults.
As of July 12, the agency says there have been 1,047 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years old or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which are through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, are with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and are more common among males and after the second dose.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, the committee said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.""

              Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever.
Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain and chills. These reactions are more likely after the second dose of those vaccines, given several weeks after the first, and are more common and severe in younger people. The Johnson & Johnson side effects, too, were more common in 18- to 59-year-old participants, and also included nausea.
As the CDC explains, these common side effects are normal signs that your body is beginning to mount an immune response and the symptoms should go away within several days. Some people have no side effects, and that is normal, too.
Rarely, the COVID-19 vaccines may cause more serious problems. This includes a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which has occurred in 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated, according to the CDC, and, for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a blood clotting disorder coupled with low levels of platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). As of July 12, that issue, which has almost entirely affected women below the age of 50, has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine.
The FDA also has warned of an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome associated with the J&J vaccine. The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases including one reported death, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine.
Additionally, there is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men.

Full Story
Early in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., we addressed questions and claims about the impact of vaccination on fertility. Some claims used a bogus argument to conclude that the mRNA vaccines — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — would cause ""female sterilization."" In reality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that there is no evidence any vaccine, including those for COVID-19, cause fertility problems.
More recently, some posts swirling on social media have spread an unfounded narrative that the vaccines will create widespread infertility problems for men.

A May 23 story published on a website called the Daily Expose, based in the U.K., and shared on Facebook more than 1,100 times, claims that the ""VACCINES could cause ‘mass male infertility.'""
The story cites an interview with Roger Hodkinson — a Canadian pathologist who in 2020 reportedly called COVID-19 ""the biggest hoax,"" erroneously likening the disease to the flu. It claims that ""the spike protein expresses in the placenta and the testes,"" which ""could kill unborn babies in current pregnancies and permanently stop men having children."" The Daily Expose story also takes aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci, suggesting the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is a ""dead man walking.""
The claims have been republished on other websites and spread elsewhere, including on Twitter and Instagram — where one popular post declared that ""all males who have been vaccinated are effectively sterile.""
But experts say there is no evidence that the vaccines cause infertility in men. And there are new data that further undercut the online claims.
In a study published June 17 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers at the University of Miami reported that they found ""no significant decreases in any sperm parameter"" among a group of healthy men before and after receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine. The team collected semen samples of 45 men, 18 and older, before receiving either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine — and again more than 70 days after receiving their second dose.
""This is the full life cycle of sperm and 70 days is sufficient time to see if the vaccine impacts semen parameters,"" Daniel C. Gonzalez, a medical student at the university and one of the study’s authors, said in a statement. ""We measured semen volume, sperm concentration, and the total amount of moving sperm and found there were no declines in any of the parameters as compared to the baseline analysis.""
Researchers at a hospital in Israel have reported similar findings in a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed. That study evaluated the sperm production in 43 men before and after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. ""Our results demonstrate that the vaccine does not impair sperm parameters,"" the authors wrote.

Dr. Puneet Masson, director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Penn Medicine, also told us in a phone interview that his observations in the field rebut the notion that vaccines are detrimental to male fertility.
""I’ve had patients who had fertility testing pre-vaccine and post-vaccine, just by virtue of my practice, and I have not had any patients I can think of who have had any adverse reactions from the vaccines in terms of fertility,"" he said.
The Society for Male Reproduction and Urology and the Society for the Study of Male Reproduction issued a joint statement in January saying that ""COVID-19 vaccines should be offered to men desiring fertility, similar to men not desiring fertility, when they meet criteria for vaccination.""
The statement notes that some men could experience a fever following vaccination, which ""can cause temporary declines in sperm production.""
""Thus, if a man experiences fever as the result of the COVID-19 vaccine, he may experience a temporary decline in sperm production, but that would be similar to or less than if the individual experienced fever from developing COVID-19 or for other reasons,"" the statement said.
Masson said that ""someone getting a mild fever from a vaccine is still better"" than getting COVID-19, especially since a fever from the disease may last longer.
Experts say a fever could affect a man’s fertility for upward of three months. But again, that’s any fever — not something unique to a fever following vaccination.
Hodkinson — the Canadian pathologist cited in the Daily Expose story alleging the potential for ""mass male infertility"" — made similar suggestions in a May video interview. He claimed that the ACE2 receptor ""is present in the testes"" and ""it’s actually on the cells that produce spermatozoa."" On the screen of the video, the headline of a paper reads: ""ACE2 receptor expression in testes: implications in coronavirus disease 2019 pathogenesis.""
That paper was published in 2020 in the journal Biology of Reproduction. The study dealt with the COVID-19 disease, not the vaccines.
Two of the study’s authors told us in an email that there was ""[a]bsolutely not"" anything in their paper that suggests the vaccines could cause issues with the testes or male fertility.
The paper ""is a hypothetical article about the potential effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male reproductive health, not about the impact of COVID-19 vaccine on male reproductive health,"" said Saguna Verma, a professor and immunologist at the University of Hawaii, and Dr. Hooman Sadri, an assistant professor and reproductive biologist at Wake Forest University.
""We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 could infect testes cells and lead to testosterone reduction or germ cell depletion for short-term period. This hypothesis was based on the clinical reports of reduced testosterone levels in COVID-19 patients,"" they said. They noted that ""these effects were transient in patients,"" so their paper did not prove that infection with the virus leads to male infertility, either.
On that point, the University of Miami research team that studied male fertility and the COVID-19 vaccines has previously reported evidence that three men who died from COVID-19 had impaired sperm function — and that the virus was present in the testes of one man — prompting questions about whether the virus itself could potentially affect male fertility. The study’s lead author, Dr. Ranjith Ramasamy, suggested further studies on the issue are in order.
Correction, June 18: Saguna Verma is a professor, not an associate professor, at the University of Hawaii. We have corrected the story.

		Quick Take
A report from two dozen experts — including a doctor named to President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory board — recommended using existing social service programs to connect people with COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The report did not advise requiring vaccination in order to receive such services, as social media posts falsely claim.

Full Story
When a COVID-19 vaccine is approved and ready, health officials will need to coordinate its distribution to hundreds of millions of people and help the public overcome misperceptions.
Dubious websites and social media posts, however, are spreading a falsehood about a report outlining distribution strategies, wrongly accusing a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory team of wanting to mandate vaccination by tying it to food assistance.
On Instagram, users shared screenshots of a Nov. 12 headline from the website Natural News, falsely claiming, ""VAX THE BLACKS: Joe Biden’s Covid-19 taskforce member recommends withholding food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines.""
Natural News was banned by Facebook earlier this year for using foreign trolls to spread its unreliable content.
The vaccine story, which also appeared on an affiliated website called Distributed News, specifically says that Dr. Luciana Borio, recently named a member of Biden’s Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board, ""says that people who refuse to be vaccinated should be deprived of food stamps and rent assistance.""
That is false.

The story offers a distorted take on one part of a July report published by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security — ""The Public’s Role in COVID-19 Vaccination: Planning Recommendations Informed by Design Thinking and the Social, Behavioral, and Communication Sciences."" The report was the result of a working group of about two dozen experts, including Borio.
The report did not recommend that vaccine ""mandates"" be tied to social service programs, such as food stamps and rent assistance, as the Natural News story claims.
Instead, one of the report’s recommendations is to ""Make Vaccination Available in Safe, Familiar, and Convenient Places."" The report explains that making vaccines widely available will ""entail local and state health departments’ developing vaccination capacity, creating local adaptations to meet communities — and, particularly, vulnerable populations — where they are, and communicating timely information in clear and accessible ways.""
One corresponding action item says this:
Local and state public health agencies should explore collaboration with interagency and nongovernment partners to bundle vaccination with other safety net services. For example, the WIC nutrition program serves as a key mechanism for connecting low-income pregnant women with nutrition supports and clinical services, and immunization screenings and vaccine promotion are built into the WIC program. Bundling services (eg, food security, rent assistance, free clinic services) that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) could be a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision. Early, rapid-response, community-based research (Recommendation #4) can help broaden planners’ understanding of how the intended beneficiaries of vaccines think about where these products fit into their lives overall, based on their own definitions of health and well-being.
In a statement provided to us in response to the viral story, Dr. Monica Schoch-Spana and Emily K. Brunson, the lead authors of the Johns Hopkins report, said that they ""do NOT advocate that such social supports ever be withheld in connection with an individual’s vaccination status.""
The statement said the viral story contained ""factual inaccuracies and misleading statements"" about the report’s recommendations, and that the authors ""take exception to the singling out and professional misrepresentation"" of Borio.
""We support voluntary vaccination during the pandemic, once safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should NOT be mandated,"" the statement added. ""We do advocate the provision of timely, accurate, and meaningful information so that individuals can make well-informed decisions about whether or not to accept vaccination for themselves or dependents in their care.""
Schoch-Spana and Brunson further said they ""support efforts to make SARS-CoV-2 vaccines readily available to everyone who wants one, including individuals with limited means."" One way to do that is to provide the vaccines ""at places where these individuals already go such as WIC clinics and food banks,"" they said.

Animal testing and clinical trials were conducted before the COVID-19 vaccines were granted emergency use authorization in the U.S. But a state senator in Texas falsely claimed at a hearing that animal tests were ""stopped"" because the ""animals were dying"" and that ""they didn’t do the human testing."" A clip of his erroneous remarks is spreading on social media.

              The unprecedented speed of the COVID-19 vaccines was due to multiple factors.
Candidates for an mRNA vaccine — the technology used for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines — can be quickly designed once scientists know the genetic sequence of the virus and which protein to target. Researchers already knew from past experience with SARS and MERS, which are other diseases caused by coronaviruses, that the spike protein the virus uses to enter cells was likely the right one.
Similarly, Johnson & Johnson has been researching adenovirus-based vaccines — the technology its COVID-19 vaccine uses — for many years in working on vaccines for HIV and Zika, and its Europe-approved Ebola vaccine.
The testing of the vaccines was also sped up by consolidating some of the early testing stages. Companies typically don’t want to proceed with expensive trials until there’s a sign the vaccine will work, but the government took on that financial risk in many cases.
The phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trials were also fast because high levels of disease transmission meant COVID-19 cases quickly accumulated among trial participants. And production capacity was sped along by starting manufacturing even before knowing whether the vaccines would be successful.

              The authorized vaccines were initially tested in early phase clinical trials, in which scientists evaluated different doses, checked for the expected immune responses and monitored for potential safety issues. To find out whether the shots prevent disease and are safe, the vaccines that passed the first set of tests were then evaluated in phase 3 trials. The Moderna phase 3 trial included about 30,000 volunteers, while the Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson trials included about 44,000 each. In each of these trials, half of the participants received a placebo, while the other half received the vaccine, and the volunteers were followed over time to see if they fell ill with COVID-19 and had any adverse reactions.  
The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed not only by the Food and Drug Administration, which made the decision to authorize the vaccines for emergency use, but also by an outside panel of experts advising the agency. Another independent group, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also reviewed the data and recommended use of the vaccines.

Full Story
The COVID-19 vaccines now authorized for emergency use in the U.S. were subject to the same forms of research routinely expected of all vaccines — even though they were manufactured in record time. In part, the process was sped up thanks to previous, related vaccine research and because some of the early testing stages were consolidated.

But a Texas state lawmaker recently claimed, falsely, that animal trials for the vaccines were ""stopped"" because ""the animals were dying."" And his words are now fueling widely viewed social media posts seeking to discredit the vaccines.
""COVID Jab: They Skipped all Animal Trials Because all Animals Were Dying & Went Directly to People,"" reads the text of a video meme repeatedly posted on Instagram. It also cites where the video was taken: ""Texas State Senate, May 2021.""
In the video clip, a man can be heard saying, ""what I have read, they actually started the animal tests and because the animals were dying, they stopped the tests."" He claims that the ""American people are now the guinea pigs"" and continues: ""They didn’t do the human testing and they stopped the animal tests because the animals were dying, and then they turned it out for the public.""
But none of that is accurate.
We traced the clip back to a May 6 public hearing before the Texas State Senate Committee on State Affairs, which was considering legislation by Republican state Sen. Bob Hall. The bill in question seeks to prohibit any mandates requiring COVID-19 vaccination.

Among the witnesses testifying was Dr. Angelina Farella, a pediatrician who criticized the COVID-19 vaccines and also repeated some erroneous claims about the vaccines.
Farella wrongly claimed, for example, that ""we have in excess of 4,000 deaths and this thing has not been pulled yet."" There have not been 4,000 deaths confirmed to be due to the vaccine as Farella suggested. The figure may refer to reports submitted to a federal database used to monitor vaccine safety — but, as we’ve explained, anyone can submit such reports, so they’re not verified or proof that the vaccine caused the reported problem. The system has been frequently misrepresented.
Nearly 44 minutes into the committee hearing, during an exchange with Farella, Hall also suggested that the COVID-19 vaccine should have been ""pulled from the market"" and made his erroneous claim about testing.
Hall, May 6: And have you seen any other vaccine that was put out for the public that skipped the animal tests?
Farella: Never before — especially for children.
Hall: What I have read, they actually started the animal tests and because the animals were dying, they stopped the tests. Folks, I think that’s important to understand there. That what we’re talking about is, the American people are now the guinea pigs. This is the test program that’s going on. They didn’t do the human testing and they stopped the animal tests because the animals were dying, and then they turned it out for the public.
But as we said, testing on both animals and humans was conducted before the COVID-19 vaccines were granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. And it is not the case that animal tests on the vaccines ""stopped"" or that the ""animals were dying.""
In the development of Moderna’s vaccine, a preclinical study published in July showed vaccinated monkeys that were challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly cleared the pathogen from their bodies, as we’ve explained. And a study published the following month found that in mice, the vaccine successfully prevented infection in the lung and nose.
Similarly, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine underwent preclinical testing in both mice and monkeys, as is noted in an FDA memo laying out the information considered in authorizing the vaccine for emergency use.
And the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was also tested in several nonclinical studies involving animals, including hamsters and monkeys.
Hall’s claim that ""they didn’t do the human testing"" is also verifiably false.
The FDA’s decision to grant the emergency use authorizations for each of the vaccines reviewed data from clinical trials — each involving tens of thousands of participants. All of the trials provided an equal number of participants with a vaccine and a placebo.
We reached out to Hall’s office to ask what he was referencing when he made his remarks, but didn’t hear back. As the Texas Tribune has documented, Hall has spread other misinformation about COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.
The false narrative that animal tests were ""skipped"" for the mRNA vaccines — those from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — was fact-checked by our colleagues at the Associated Press in November. And we’ve previously reported on other claims about the COVID-19 vaccines that misrepresented old studies involving animals and vaccine candidates for other coronaviruses.
Update May 24: Facebook has now removed posts of the video meme from its platforms. A spokesperson for the company told us the posts were removed because they violated Facebook’s policies against COVID-19 misinformation—which ban ""[c]laims that COVID-19 vaccines are untested,"" among other things. We note that such content-removal decisions are made by Facebook, as part of its Community Standards enforcement, and are independent of our work as a third-party fact-checking partner with Facebook.

		Calling investigational COVID-19 antibody drugs ""cures"" in a video posted to Twitter, President Donald Trump incorrectly said the therapies had been authorized and that ""hundreds of thousands of doses"" were nearly ready.
He also suggested he had personally benefited from an antibody cocktail made by the biotech company Regeneron. It was one of several drugs the president received since he tested positive for the coronavirus.
The president later undercut that message, claiming in a subsequent interview that he ""would’ve done it fine with no drugs,"" but iterated that the drugs had cured him in another video.


The drugs in question are monoclonal antibodies, which are synthetic proteins optimized to recognize the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and in theory should help clear the virus from the body. While many experts view them as promising — and some early data support that enthusiasm — the products are still in clinical trials and have not been proven to be effective for COVID-19 patients, much less cure the disease.
Trump’s Video 
In the first video, which was posted to Twitter on Oct. 7, Trump praised the effects of the Regeneron antibody cocktail he received prior to being admitted on Oct. 2 to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a three-day stay.
""I went in and I wasn’t feeling so hot, and within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron,"" Trump said, incorrectly referring to the cocktail by the company’s name and contradicting his physician on being given the drug at the White House. ""It’s called Regeneron, and other things too. But I think this was the key, but they gave me Regeneron, and it was like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now.""
The president proceeded to note that another company is also behind a similar drug, and confusingly said both that the drugs had been authorized and that he was trying to help in that process.
Trump, Oct. 7: We have Regeneron. We have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they’re coming out and we’re trying to get them on an emergency basis. We’ve authorized it. I’ve authorized it. And if you’re in the hospital and you’re feeling really bad, I think we’re going to work it so that you get them and you’re going to get them free, and especially if you’re a senior, we’re going to get you in there quick. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.
I have emergency use authorization, all set, and we got to get it signed now, and you’re going to get better. You’re going to get better, really fast. This is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago. … I view these, I know they call them therapeutic, but to me it wasn’t therapeutic, it just made me better. OK, I call that a cure. So I want to get these things done. So we have to get them done. We have to get them approved, and I want to get them to the hospitals where people are feeling badly.
In fact, as of Oct. 8, no monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 has received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, although two companies have submitted those applications. 
Regeneron announced its submission for REGN-COV2, its dual antibody cocktail, hours after Trump’s video landed on Twitter on Oct. 7. Eli Lilly announced a submission for its single-antibody drug earlier the same day; the company said it expected to apply for an EUA for its combination antibody in November, ""pending clinical trial enrollment, once additional safety data accumulate and sufficient supply is manufactured.""
The president should have no involvement in whether the FDA issues an EUA, as that decision is supposed to be up to career scientists at the agency.
Trump later emphasized his own experience once again, calling the antibody cocktail ""a cure"" and saying that his contracting of the coronavirus was ""a blessing from God.""
""Some people don’t know how to define therapeutic. I view it different, it’s a cure,"" he said. ""For me, I walked in, I didn’t feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I wanted to get out of the hospital and that’s what I want for everybody. I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great.""
""I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it,"" he added. ""This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it. I heard about this drug. I said, ‘Let me take it.’ It was my suggestion. I said, ‘Let me take it,’ and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. I think if I didn’t catch it, we’d be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job.""
Trump acknowledged his unique position as president to receive investigational drugs that are unavailable to nearly all other Americans. According to STAT News, at the time Trump received his dose of the Regeneron cocktail, fewer than 10 patients had been provided the cocktail outside of its trials. 
Trump also gave a misleading impression of how available the antibody cocktails would be, should they receive FDA authorization. Along with his figure of ""hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready,"" Trump said near the end of the video that ""the drug companies have just made a lot of it.""
And in a follow-up video posted to the president’s Twitter account on Oct. 8, but filmed the day before, Trump addressed America’s seniors, repeating his claims that the antibodies are ""a cure"" and saying the drugs were going to be available ""immediately.""
The companies have not provided such optimistic figures. Regeneron said on Oct. 7 that at the moment, it has enough doses to treat ""approximately 50,000 patients"" and expects to have enough for 250,000 more ""within the next few months."" Eli Lily estimates that for its single antibody, it will have 100,000 doses in October, with up to 1 million doses by the end of the year.
That would suggest that at most, only about 150,000 doses of these drugs would be immediately available with the potentially forthcoming EUAs.
In both videos, Trump also promised the monoclonal antibodies would be free to the public, saying in the second, ""We’re going to take care of our seniors all free."" There are plans in place for some of the initial doses to be free, but it’s unclear how long that will last.
The U.S. government signed a deal with Regeneron in July to produce a fixed number of lots of its cocktail at government expense, which would be provided to Americans at no cost. The exact number of doses those lots will yield depends on the dosage that the trials determine is safe and effective, but could range from between 70,000 to 300,000 treatment doses. After that, there is no guarantee the drugs would be free and patients at all times could be charged for being administered the therapy.
Production of monoclonal antibodies is not trivial and isn’t easily scaled up, so there is concern that supplies of the therapies will not be able to meet demand. 
""Antibody drugs will be critical bridge to Covid vaccine, but supply is very limited,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA chief under Trump, said in an Oct. 7 tweet. ""We needed to pay companies to convert existing manufacturing and stop production of some drugs to free space for these – and didn’t. It’s not too late.""
In another tweet, Gottlieb demonstrated how limited even 300,000 doses might be, calculating that it would be enough to treat all Americans over the age of 65 who are infected with the virus for only a bit more than a month. ""About 15% of Covid cases diagnosed each day are over 65. Based on that age criteria alone, >7,500 patients per day could be indicated for this drug, 225K per month,"" he said. ""We need more supply, which may not be possible now for 2020, but could be available in 2021 if we take right steps.""
Both Eli Lily and Regeneron have teamed up with other companies to increase output.
A ‘Cure’?
As for whether Trump benefited from Regeneron’s cocktail, that’s impossible to know. Only through clinical trials is it possible to know if the drugs are safe and effective, and even then, it’s uncertain how much any particular therapy will help an individual.
As Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an Oct. 8 interview on MSNBC, it’s not even clear that Trump has fully beaten the coronavirus yet.
""One of the issues that we all have to be aware — and his physicians are aware of this — that the history of COVID-19 is that you could look and feel like you’re doing reasonably well, and after a couple of days you could have a downturn, namely have a reversal,"" he said. ""That’s possible. The chances of that happening, I don’t know. As good as he looks, I don’t think that’s going to happen, but I don’t know. But you have to be heads up that it might happen.""
Fauci also cautioned against coming to premature conclusions about the effectiveness of the antibodies, although he said he thought it was likely that they did help the president.
""The preliminary data from those antibodies are favorable. I think it’s a reasonably good chance that the antibody that he received, the Regeneron antibody, made a significant difference in a positive way in his course,"" he said. ""But when you have only one, we refer to it in medicine as N equals 1, when you have only one, you can’t make the determination that that’s a cure. You have to do a clinical trial involving a large number of individuals compared either to a placebo or another intervention.""
Other physicians are not so sure the antibody cocktail is responsible for his condition — at least not at the speed that he claims — and point out that Trump was also given other drugs, namely the antiviral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.
Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told the New York Times that there was no chance the cocktail ""cured"" Trump in 24 hours, and suspected the president might be feeling so good because of the dexamethasone. 
Of course, Trump also might not have needed any of the medications, as most COVID-19 patients recover without them.
The existing data on the various monoclonal antibodies is generally positive, but are hardly conclusive at this point — and do not point to a ""cure"" for all patients.
Regeneron announced preliminary results from its first 275 patients in a Sept. 29 press release, saying that its dual antibody ""reduced viral load and the time to alleviate symptoms in non-hospitalized patients.""
Notably, the company said it saw differences in the impact of the cocktail in patients who were given the cocktail early versus late in their disease courses. Those who had already developed antibodies on their own saw less of an improvement compared to controls, suggesting that for the drug to be most effective, it would have to be delivered shortly after a rapid diagnosis.
Eli Lilly also released interim results on Oct. 7 for its two-antibody cocktail, finding the combo reduced the viral load as early as three days after treatment in COVID-19 outpatients. The drug also reduced symptoms and hospitalizations and ER visits, with 0.9% of treated patients entering a hospital compared with 5.8% of those getting the placebo. The latter result, however, barely reached statistical significance, given the small size of the study.
But the antibody cocktail isn’t the drug Eli Lilly is moving forward with first. The one the company submitted for its EUA, which targets higher-risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, is for just one of the two antibodies.
The data on the single antibody treatment is slightly less impressive, with only the highest dose of the antibody showing a decrease in the viral load after 11 days in a phase 2 trial. Across the three doses tested, there was a drop in the rate of hospitalization or ER visits compared with controls — 1.7% versus 6% — which was based on just 14 such events.
The results for both companies reflect the outcomes of only several hundred patients and have not been published in peer-reviewed journals.
Many experts, such as Fauci, are optimistic. But it’s premature to claim that the COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies are safe and effective before the trial results are in, as Trump did in his second video, when he called the therapy ""totally safe""  but ""powerful against this disease,"" or to brand them cures.

		This video reviews some of the statements that we fact-checked during the Democratic National Convention, which ended Aug. 20 with former Vice President Joe Biden accepting his party’s nomination for president.

Our video covers these five claims:

Biden correctly noted that there have been more than 5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and more than 170,000 deaths, but then said that America has ""by far the worst performance of any nation."" While that’s true based on the raw totals of COVID-19 cases and deaths, the U.S. is not the worst when adjusted for population or on other metrics.
Former President Bill Clinton misleadingly compared the current U.S. unemployment rate to those of other countries, including the United Kingdom. But Clinton’s comparison is meaningless, because the U.S. counts a laid-off worker as ""unemployed"" even if the layoff is expected to be temporary — while many other countries do not.
Hillary Clinton, the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, said that ""billionaires got $400 billion richer"" during the pandemic. That misleading figure comes from two liberal groups that calculated net worth gains during what they erroneously called ""the first two months"" of the pandemic, beginning March 18. That ignores the stock market crash a month earlier.
Sen. Bernie Sanders also cited a liberal advocacy group when he claimed Biden’s support for a $15 minimum wage ""will give 40 million workers a pay raise and push the wage scale up for everyone else."" But the Congressional Budget Office projects a much less dramatic impact, and some probable job losses.
Former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said when Barack Obama and Joe Biden were in the White House, ""They extended overtime pay to more than 4 million workers."" They tried to do that, but the Obama-era rule never went into effect.

Please see our convention stories for details on these and other claims that we wrote about during the four-day nominating event.

		Q: Can employers, colleges and universities require COVID-19 vaccinations?


A: Generally, they may require immunizations. But there is some uncertainty about the legality of mandating vaccines authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
FULL QUESTION
Does federal law prohibit employers and other institutions from requiring the COVID-19 vaccine?
FULL ANSWER
According to a list maintained by The Chronicle of Higher Education, more than 200 colleges and universities are ""requiring [COVID-19] vaccines of at least some students or employees"" ahead of the fall semester.
Other employers are requiring — or at least considering a requirement — that their workers be vaccinated against the disease, as well.
Is that legal? 
There is no federal law that says vaccines cannot be required for employees or students. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: ""Whether an employer may require or mandate COVID-19 vaccination is a matter of state or other applicable law.""
In updated guidance issued in December, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission implied that employers can have a mandatory vaccination policy, including for COVID-19, as long as employers comply with federal laws stipulating that reasonable accommodations should be made for workers who cannot be immunized because of a disability or religious reason.
Employers also may be subject to collective bargaining agreements that require them to negotiate with employee unions before mandating vaccines as a condition of employment, as the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has noted.
But some employers — particularly in the health care industry — already have a history of requiring certain vaccinations, such as for influenza, for their workers.
In addition, a 2017 survey of 129 of the top U.S. colleges and universities found that 94% of them had at least one prematriculation immunization requirement for students. The average was 3.53 required immunizations, for diseases such as hepatitis B and measles.
However, there remains some uncertainty about the legality of institutions mandating vaccinations using products that have not been fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Emergency Use Authorization vs. Full Approval
As we have explained, the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have all received an emergency use authorization, or EUA, rather than the standard full licensure, which is called a biologics license application, or BLA. 
On May 7, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they have initiated the final BLA approval process for their jointly-produced vaccine. But Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — the makers of the other two authorized vaccines — still have not said when they will do the same.
Typically, the standards are less stringent for EUAs. Under an EUA, regulators must determine that the product ""may be effective"" and the ""known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks."" However, for the three COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA set up special, more rigorous EUA requirements that resemble the process for a BLA. The FDA required ""at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner"" and wanted to see at least two months of follow-up data on half or more of the participants. 
But to some legal observers, the current authorization status of the vaccines means they cannot yet be required by employers and others. 
In a Feb. 16 post for the Health Affairs blog, Efthimios Parasidis, a professor of law and public health at the Ohio State University, and Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, concluded that, ""Although EUAs for Covid-19 vaccines may help society overcome the wrath of the pandemic, mandates for such vaccines are unlikely to pass legal muster."" 
They pointed to a provision in the 2004 federal law that established EUAs — specifically the provision that requires informational disclosures for individuals offered a medical product authorized for emergency use.
""Specifically, under 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III), each individual must be informed ‘of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks,'"" Parasidis and Kesselheim wrote. 
""Although no court has interpreted this provision, the first segment of the subclause suggests that mandates are categorically prohibited, since each person must have ‘the option to accept or refuse.'""
Other law and health policy experts disagree.
""There are few to no legal barriers to employers or schools requiring vaccines being distributed under EUAs,"" according to an April 5 opinion piece written by three legal experts for the health news website STAT. The coauthors were Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of Law; and I. Glenn Cohen and Carmel Shachar of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School.
They counter argued that the EUA statute actually applies to the actions of federal officials — such as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services — not private actors, including employers and post-secondary schools. 
""Private employees are generally ‘at will,’ meaning they can be terminated for any reason that is not explicitly illegal,"" the authors wrote. ""Those arguing that the EUA statute prohibits mandates by at-will employers are claiming that this federal law is changing existing state employment law on the topic by mere implication. They are reading in a broad prohibition covering all employers and universities in the U.S. that is not, in fact, in the statute. Such broad preemption would require, at a minimum, clearer language.""
Also, because individuals must be given information about ""the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product,"" that ""clearly"" means ""consequences for refusal can coexist with the option to refuse,"" said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a presidential assistant professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, and Govind Persad, an assistant professor of law at the University of Denver.
""The FDA doesn’t specify what those consequences might be, but it also doesn’t limit them,"" they wrote in a May 4 opinion piece for the Washington Post. ""If Congress or the FDA had meant to remove the authority to mandate vaccines — an authority traditionally left to state and local governments — the emergency use authorization statute and guidance would have needed to be much clearer on that point.""
Fernandez Lynch and Persad suggested the consequences for refusing vaccination could include ""job loss, fines, one more year of Zoom college, or exclusion from flights, concerts or bars."" All may be unpopular options, but ""these are choices nonetheless,"" they said.
In their opinion piece, however, Parasidis and Kesselheim asserted that the statute’s language on the consequences of refusing to be vaccinated is most plausibly a reference to only the ""health risks of refusing an EUA product during a public health emergency,"" such as an increased risk of contracting or transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
""A review of the Congressional Record reveals no mention of allowing the government or private entities the ability to mandate administration of EUA products,"" the professors wrote.
But absent any state or local laws specifically permitting or prohibiting mandates for EUA vaccines, determining the legality of such requirements will likely come down to future court decisions.
Currently, there are at least two pending federal lawsuits that will test the issue: one filed by a county corrections officer in New Mexico, and another filed by a group of Los Angeles public school workers. The plaintiffs in both cases argue that their government employers are illegally mandating EUA vaccines as a condition of employment.
Legal analysts expect that there will be more lawsuits, including against private employers and colleges and universities.
Update, July 20: On July 18, a federal judge upheld Indiana University’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement, denying the student plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction to block the policy. The plaintiffs had cited their constitutional right to due process under the 14th Amendment. In a 101-page ruling, Judge Damon R. Leichty of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana wrote that ""the Fourteenth Amendment permits Indiana University to pursue a reasonable and due process of vaccination in the legitimate interest of public health for its students, faculty, and staff.""   
""Indiana University insisting on vaccinations for its campus communities is rationally related to ensuring the public health of students, faculty, and staff this fall,"" wrote Leichty, who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. ""Stemming illness, hospitalizations, or deaths at the university level hardly proves irrational.""

      Testing, By the Numbers

		Flanked by large signs proclaiming, ""America leads the world in testing,"" President Donald Trump said at a May 11 press conference, ""we’ve prevailed on testing."" While the United States has done more total tests for COVID-19 than any other country, it doesn’t lead when testing is measured by other metrics.
At the same press briefing, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, who is in charge of the government’s testing efforts, said: ""No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing."" Let’s take a look.
Total Number of Tests
As he has stated repeatedly, Trump touted the total number of tests conducted in the U.S. as being the most of any country in the world. ""This week the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted, nearly double the number of any other country,"" he said.
It’s true that the U.S. — by far — has conducted the most tests for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as measured in raw numbers. In the press conference, Giroir showed a graph, similar to the one below, by Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford, that demonstrated this.

As of May 11, the U.S. had conducted 9.35 million tests. The country with the second-highest number was Russia, with 5.8 million tests, as of May 12.
We’d note that Our World in Data cautions comparisons of different countries may not be apples-to-apples. It notes: ""[T]here are substantial differences across countries in terms of the units, whether or not all labs are included, the extent to which negative and pending tests are included and other aspects."" 
Per-Capita Tests
But the U.S. has a much larger population than most countries, which would make a per-capita comparison a better gauge of countries’ testing efforts. As we’ve explained before, testing a higher proportion of the population increases the ability to control the spread of COVID-19, making the per-capita metric an important one.
Both Trump and Giroir cited per-capita measures, but made misleading claims, leaving out countries that have done better than the U.S. in this regard.
""We’re testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland and many other countries, and in some cases combined,"" Trump said.
After Giroir showed the graphic on total tests, he said: ""If you look at per capita, everyone talks about South Korea being the standard, today we will have done more than twice their per capita rate of testing that was accomplished in South Korea. No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing.""
But he didn’t show a per-capita graph such as the one below, which refutes the idea that the U.S. leads ""no matter how you look at it.""

The U.S. was at 26.31 tests per 1,000 people as of May 9. That’s more than South Korea, but less than Iceland, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, Austria, Australia, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Russia and Spain, among others. Worldometer, a data aggregation website, listed 39 countries and territories with higher per-capita testing rates than the U.S. as of May 12.
South Korea used to have a higher per-capita testing rate, when Trump first made misleading comparisons to the country in late March. It’s noteworthy that the U.S. did ramp up testing and, by April 17, surpass South Korea by this measure. But the two countries reported their first cases of COVID-19 around the same time, on Jan. 20 and 21. Yet South Korea began aggressively testing earlier than the U.S., as this graph shows. 

South Korea has been held up as an example, as Giroir mentioned, of how early testing can enable countries to identify and isolate cases, flattening the curve. While the U.S. is now doing more testing, the two countries are at different trajectories in the spread of the disease. Line graphs on the number of confirmed cases show the U.S. on a sharp curve up, beginning in late March, while South Korea’s cases spiked earlier, in late February and early March — and the number remained relatively flat through April.
Economic researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis noted in an April 22 paper that South Korea’s early testing ""seems to have paid off,"" while U.S. ""inaction"" resulted in more confirmed COVID-19 cases.
""Testing early and often seems to have paid off for South Korea,"" the St. Louis Fed researchers wrote. ""The weeks lost due to inaction in the United States during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rationing of tests to those with severe symptoms. Thus, the United States had a large number of confirmed cases relative to South Korea.""
Tests Per Confirmed Case
Another way of comparing countries is by the number of tests each has performed per confirmed case. By this measure, the U.S. lags far behind most nations, according to Our World in Data.
The map below shows that the U.S., as of May 9, had done only about seven tests per confirmed case — far fewer than South Korea (61), Russia (28), Canada (16) and Japan (14), for example. (Note: The data is updated regularly, so use the slider to change the date to May 9.)

Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told us for a previous story that per-capita test numbers are ""not as informative as looking at testing per positive infection identified."" 
Comparing the U.S. to South Korea, for example, Shaman said, ""They’re testing 10 times as many per infection found.""
We downloaded the data for May 9 and found that the U.S. ranked 59th out of 64 countries in tests per confirmed case as of that date.
In April, the Rockefeller Foundation issued a ""testing action plan"" that called for ""rapidly expanding testing capacity to 30 million tests per week over the next six months"" in the U.S.
CNBC, April 21: The Rockefeller plan says that more testing must be done to accurately capture the level of Covid-19 infections in the U.S.
""In Taiwan, there have been 132 tests conducted for every confirmed case. In Australia, the number is 62. In the United States, it is five,"" an executive summary of the plan notes.
As of May 9, the U.S. has conducted about seven tests for every confirmed case, while Taiwan has conducted about 153.
We can also look at this measure in percentage terms: the test positivity rate, or the share of total tests that are positive.
As we wrote recently, if a high percentage of tests are positive, that suggests only the sickest patients are being tested and mild cases are likely being missed, a Johns Hopkins website explains. The World Health Organization has recommended that countries aim for about a 10% test positivity rate to make sure there’s enough testing being conducted to detect all cases. 
The U.S. is now at a 14.2% test positivity rate as of May 11. That’s not ""leading the world"" either.

		Even after contracting the coronavirus and being hospitalized, President Donald Trump has continued to downplay the risks of COVID-19 and exaggerate the progress the U.S. has made in fighting the pandemic.

Trump told Americans to not let the coronavirus ""dominate you,"" saying, ""You’re going to beat it."" Of course, not everyone has or will survive, and some survivors will have lasting effects. (Read more.)
The president made a flawed comparison between COVID-19 and seasonal flu, incorrectly saying that ""sometimes over 100,000"" people die from flu each year. The highest estimated death toll from flu in the past decade was in 2017-2018, with 61,000 deaths. (Read more.)
The president talked up the effectiveness of COVID-19 therapeutics and inaccurately attributed some of those successes to his administration. Few options exist for most patients. (Read more.)
After his release from the hospital, Trump claimed to be feeling ""better than 20 years ago,"" but his own physician cautioned that he might not be ""out of the woods"" yet. (Read more.)
Saying COVID-19 vaccines ""are coming momentarily,"" the president once again exaggerated when the public can expect to get a coronavirus shot. (Read more.)

Some Won’t ‘Beat’ COVID-19
After he returned to the White House from Walter Reed hospital on Oct. 5, Trump released a video in which he gave a pep talk of sorts: ""I learned so much about coronavirus and one thing that’s for certain: Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it. You’re going to beat it,"" he said.
Of course, not everyone is going to ""beat it."" More than 210,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, and more than 1 million worldwide.
It’s true that the overwhelming majority of people who have contracted COVID-19 have survived it. The case fatality rate in the United States is now 2.8% — that’s the percentage of those with confirmed cases who have died. And since not everyone who has been infected has been tested, experts estimate the fatality rate for the coronavirus is likely between 0.5% and 1%.
The chances of ""you"" beating it are quite good. But there are risk factors that make some individuals more likely to fare well than others.
The older the patient, the greater the risk of hospitalization and death. Figures from the CDC, based on data available through Aug. 18, show that people ages 65 to 74 are five times as likely as 18- to 29-year-olds to be hospitalized and 90 times more likely to die. Those ages 75 to 84 are eight times as likely to be hospitalized and 220 times more likely to die than the young-adult cohort. 
Underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, asthma and chronic kidney disease, increase the risk of hospitalization, the CDC says.
CDC data for the year show that 12.7% of those ages 70-79 who were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 died, and 26.6% of those age 80 and older who were infected died. The dataset has some missing and unknown data on deaths, but from the available information, those fatality rates contrast with just 1.6% for those ages 50-59 and 0.07% for 20- to 29-year-olds who were known to be infected.
Even younger Americans die from the disease, but the rate of death increases with age. For the month of August, there were 5 deaths among those 9 years of age and younger, 16 deaths among 10- to 19-year-olds and 75 deaths among 20- to 29-year-olds. But among those with COVID-19 in the 60-69 age group, 1,890 died in August and 5,638 who were 80 and older died.
The impact of COVID-19 also has been disproportionate based on race and ethnicity. Mortality rates, meaning the deaths per total population not deaths per those infected, are significantly higher among Black Americans (97.9 deaths per 100,000), indigenous Americans (81.9 deaths per 100,000), Pacific Islanders (71.5) and Latinos (64.7) than whites (46.6) and Asians (40.4), according to data compiled by the APM Research Lab through Sept. 15.
Also, among the coronavirus patients who recover, some experience long-term effects and symptoms.
As we’ve written before, these so-called ""long-haulers"" have shared their stories in online support groups and with journalists. Some patients report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches, brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult. They are still trying to ""beat"" COVID-19.
Influenza
On Oct. 6, the morning after returning to the White House from a three-day stay at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Trump tweeted about the flu, reviving an old, false claim that the coronavirus is less deadly than seasonal influenza.
""Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu,"" Trump wrote. ""Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!""
Trump exaggerates the death toll from influenza and misleadingly says COVID-19 is ""in most populations far less lethal."" That’s likely true for children and some younger people, but not other groups, for whom the risk of death from infection is either similar to flu or significantly higher.
Twitter put a warning on Trump’s tweet for violating its rules on ""spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.""
Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that for the past decade, seasonal influenza has claimed between 12,000 and 61,000 lives each year — and on average, fewer than 40,000 lives. 
The worst season in the past 10 years was the 2017-2018 season, which the CDC estimates killed 61,000 people, with a range of 46,000 to 95,000 deaths. Even factoring in the range, however, that season is not thought to have taken more than 100,000 lives.
The CDC’s estimates for earlier seasons also are below Trump’s 100,000 figure. According to a 2010 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, seasonal influenza-associated deaths between 1976 and 2007 ranged from a low of 3,349 in 1986-1987 to 48,614 in 2003-2004.
These figures, importantly, are not reports of individual deaths, which is what we have for COVID-19, but rather are estimates based on mathematical modeling. For this reason, they cannot be directly compared with the COVID-19 death toll, which at exceeds 210,000 in the U.S. as of Oct. 6 and is almost certainly an undercount.
In any case, even using that figure, COVID-19 has killed more people in the U.S. than the past five flu seasons combined. A preliminary estimate for the 2019-2020 season, which overlapped to a small degree with COVID-19 this spring, estimates flu deaths at 22,000 — about 10 times lower than the number of COVID-19 deaths so far this year.
Another sign that COVID-19 has caused unprecedented mortality is the large number of excess deaths since the virus arrived in America. The CDC’s latest estimate is that between Feb. 1 and Sept. 19, there have been between 214,865 and 285,404 more deaths in the U.S. than usual, with a middle estimate of just over 250,000 excess deaths. While not all of these deaths are due to COVID-19, some fraction of them are.
Trump’s claim that COVID-19 is ""in most populations far less lethal"" than the flu is misleading. 
Experts say that overall, COVID-19 is more deadly than seasonal flu, for which the mortality rate is ""usually well below 0.1%,"" according to the World Health Organization. 
As we’ve discussed before, the true infection fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, for COVID-19 isn’t entirely clear, but the WHO estimates it to be between 0.5% and 1%.
It is true that flu is likely more risky for most children than COVID-19.
The CDC’s website says the ""risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,"" although it notes that infants and kids with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both viral infections — and that school-aged children infected with COVID-19 are at higher risk of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, ""a rare but severe complication of COVID-19.""
The CDC also provides its own estimate of the infection fatality rate by age, but it is based on a single paper covering six European regions — and is not meant to be an estimate of the impact of COVID-19. 
According to the agency, the infection fatality rate is very low for kids 19 years old and younger — at 0.003% — and quite low for adults ages 20 to 49, at 0.02%. But for people ages 50 to 69, the infection fatality rate is significantly higher, at 0.5%, and a whopping 5.4% above the age of 70.
Around 117 million people in the U.S. are 50 or older, accounting for more than a third of the country. Many people of all ages also have one or more risk factors for COVID-19, which would alter their individual risk.
Regardless, experts say the infection fatality rate is not the only measure that matters when it comes to knowing how dangerous a virus can be to a population.
Unlike seasonal influenza, for which there are approved drugs and a vaccine, there are only a limited number of therapies for COVID-19. And much of the population has some immunity to flu viruses each year, since they circulate seasonally, coming back in modified, but not entirely new forms. That’s not the case for SARS-CoV-2, which is a new pandemic virus, so many more people are susceptible.
The coronavirus is also thought to spread more easily than seasonal flu and poses particular challenges as more cases are linked to superspreading events.
""While COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is more contagious among certain populations and age groups than flu,"" the CDC explains on its website. ""Also, COVID-19 has been observed to have more superspreading events than flu. This means the virus that causes COVID-19 can quickly and easily spread to a lot of people and result in continuous spreading among people as time progresses.""
Thus, even if younger people are less at risk from the coronavirus than flu, if they spread it to older people, as the CDC has suggested has happened, the damage can be significant.
As Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us previously, ""I’m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.""
The data to date show there’s no contest between COVID-19 and seasonal influenza — the coronavirus has killed far more people and the pandemic is still ongoing.
COVID-19 Therapies
In tweets and video appearances during his convalescence, Trump repeatedly boasted about available COVID-19 therapeutics, taking undue credit for the developments and exaggerating the degree to which they are known to be effective.
In an Oct. 3 video filmed at Walter Reed — a day into Trump’s hospital stay — the president likened the therapeutics to miracles.
""If you look at the therapeutics, which I’m taking right now, some of them, and others are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they’re miracles, if you want to know the truth, they’re miracles,"" he said. ""People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they’re miracles, coming down from God.""
Two days later, Trump echoed the claim, but also took credit for the drug developments.
""We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge,"" Trump said in an Oct. 5 tweet announcing his departure later that day from the hospital.
And in an Oct. 5 video released after Trump’s return to the White House, he once again returned to the subject. ""We have the best medical equipment. We have the best medicines, all developed recently, and you’re going to beat it,"" he said, after advising the public not to be afraid of the coronavirus.
In reality, as we’ve explained, there remain few treatment options for COVID-19, with the mainstay primarily being supportive care. And of the few drugs that do exist, some are either not yet widely available to the public, have yet to demonstrate a mortality benefit or were not investigated in the U.S. 
The FDA has not approved any drugs for COVID-19, but has issued a few emergency use authorizations, or EUAs.
According to his physicians, Trump received at least three drugs: an investigational antibody cocktail normally unavailable outside of a clinical trial, the antiviral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.
Dexamethasone is the only drug that has been shown to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients survive in a clinical trial, but its use is relatively limited. It is recommended only for patients on a ventilator or receiving supplemental oxygen, as it may harm other patients. It is also hardly a cure, as it reduced death by 18% in patients receiving oxygen and 36% in those who were ventilated.
The drug was developed in the U.S., but more than a half century ago. The randomized controlled trial establishing its utility in COVID-19 patients was conducted in the U.K.
Remdesivir has been shown to shorten the time to recovery for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but whether it provides a mortality benefit is still unknown. The FDA is permitting its use under an EUA that is restricted to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
While the trials demonstrating an effect in COVID-19 patients were done during the Trump administration, getting the drug to that point goes back more than a decade. Remdesivir was famously tested against the Ebola virus in 2014 and then was tested against other coronaviruses, including the SARS and MERS viruses, setting it up nicely as a candidate that might work against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
Trump’s third drug, an antibody cocktail targeting the coronavirus made by the biotech company Regeneron, is widely viewed as a promising potential therapy. But there is no proof yet that the therapy is effective, and it’s not yet available to the vast majority of the country.
On Sept. 29, the company announced preliminary results from its first 275 patients, saying in a press release that its antibody cocktail reduced viral levels and reduced symptoms among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Other companies are working on developing similar antibodies, and Eli Lily issued similar interim results via press release.
Trump received Regeneron’s product, which is still in testing and has not received an EUA from the FDA, through a compassionate use request. Normally, the only way to receive such a medicine would be to participate in a clinical trial.
The company explained in a statement that its focus was on maintaining enough supply of its cocktail for trials, and said there ""is limited product available for compassionate use requests that have been approved under rare, exceptional circumstances on a case-by-case basis.""
Even if the antibodies do pan out in trials and are approved, there is concern that their supplies will be limited because making the proteins is a complex and expensive process.
Trump’s Health
In urging the public not to let COVID-19 ""dominate your life,"" the president boasted on Twitter and in a video that he is feeling ""better than 20 years ago.""
But the president may not be — in the words of his doctor — ""out of the woods"" yet.
In confirming that Trump would be released from the hospital, Dr. Sean P. Conley, the president’s physician, said: ""Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations — and most importantly his clinical status — support the president’s safe return home, where he’ll be surrounded by world-class medical care 24/7.""
There is no question that the president’s condition has improved. Trump initially had a fever, a mild cough, fatigue and at least two brief drops in his oxygen saturation level, according to his doctors. But, as of Oct. 5, the president had been fever-free in the last 72 hours, hasn’t required any additional oxygen and hasn’t complained of shortness of breath, his doctors said.
As for his vital organs, the president’s ""cardiac, liver and kidney function demonstrates continued normal findings or improving findings,"" Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist at Walter Reed, said on Oct. 4.
However, the president’s doctors have repeatedly declined to answer questions about Trump’s lung function.
On Oct. 4, Conley was vague when asked about signs of pneumonia or lung damage, saying there had been ""some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern."" On Oct. 5, he declined again to reveal the results of X-rays or CT scans, citing a federal law that prevents a doctor from discussing a patient’s health without the patient’s consent. 
Trump remains at risk for developing a more severe case of COVID-19. 
Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta, told the New York Times in April that some patients experience ""a very nasty second wave"" of the illness between five to 10 days after experiencing symptoms. ""After the initial symptoms, things plateau and maybe even improve a little bit, and then there is a secondary worsening,"" Schwartz said.
That is especially for older people with underlying health conditions. At 74 years old, Trump is at higher risk than younger people for contracting a serious case of COVID-19, and males have consistently had worse outcomes, on average, than females. He is also slightly obese, with a body mass index of 30.5 (30 is considered obese) — another risk factor. 
When confirming Trump’s release from the hospital, Conley said Trump is still within that 10-day window and won’t take ""that final deep sigh of relief"" until next week.
Reporter, Oct. 5: You had said that seven to 10 days was a window that you’d be concerned about. I don’t think we’re there yet. So, do you have concerns about potential worsening or reversal? And what are your plans for addressing that if it were to happen?
Conley: You’re absolutely right. And that’s why we all remain cautiously optimistic and on guard because we’re in a bit of unchartered territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course. So, we’re looking to this weekend. If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief.
Vaccines ‘Coming Momentarily’?
In his video after being released from the hospital, Trump said that ""the vaccines are coming momentarily."" It is not clear yet when vaccines will be available, but even in a best-case scenario it won’t be ""momentarily"" for the general population.
As we have written before, there are four companies running phase 3 trials of a coronavirus vaccine in the U.S. A successful phase 3 trial is the final step needed for approval. Assuming the trials go well and the shots are found to be safe and effective, one or more vaccines may be available by the end of the year or by early 2021 to select groups, such as health care workers and adults with underlying conditions. 
Members of the general population who are not prioritized for vaccination, however, are not expected to be able to receive a vaccine until later in 2021. 
According to guidance the FDA released on Oct. 6, the agency is looking for phase 3 trial data that include ""a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen.""

That timeline makes it very unlikely that any vaccine would receive authorization prior to Nov. 3, Election Day.
(We deal more extensively with the status of the vaccine candidates in ""Updated: Q&A on Trump’s COVID-19 Diagnosis."")

      Cuomo Distorts CDC Finding in Blaming Trump

		New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made the over-the-top claim that if the Trump administration ""had done its job, the virus wouldn’t come"" to New York. Cuomo pointed to a study that suggested government officials could have better mitigated the spread of the coronavirus in New York City, but it didn’t say they could have stopped it.
Cuomo made his comments in a July 16 CNN interview after anchor Kate Bolduan asked him about criticism from CNN’s Jake Tapper of a poster Cuomo released depicting New York’s fight against the coronavirus as a successful climb up and down a mountain. The poster, which Cuomo sketched and can be purchased for $11.50, is a whimsical homage of sorts to early 1900s poster art.
Tapper, in a July 14 Twitter thread, mentioned the poster in criticizing the ""crowing"" from Cuomo’s administration over the state’s handling of the pandemic. ""NY state has lost more than 32,000 lives to COVID-19,"" Tapper wrote. ""So while it’s great that the numbers have gone down, it’s perplexing to see crowing. … No other state has lost as many lives, not even close.""
The poster doesn’t mention that. Bolduan asked Cuomo: ""Do you think the poster was a mistake in the midst of all this?""
The governor responded by referring to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that he and Bolduan had discussed. The study found that genome sequencing of positive coronavirus cases in New York City mostly resembled sequences in Europe, but the U.S. government’s travel restrictions on Europe were implemented too late to mitigate the introduction of the virus. Those restrictions were implemented on March 13; by March 15, the CDC report says, ""community transmission was widespread in New York City.""
Cuomo, July 16: No, Tapper’s point — as you just heard from the CDC report, Tapper should say that Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York, because that’s the fact. That’s what the CDC just said.
If Trump’s government had done its job, the virus wouldn’t come here. We don’t do — governors don’t do global pandemics. I was trying to explain that to Mr. Tapper. State governments don’t do global public health. …
The federal government does that. The virus didn’t come here because of anything New Yorkers did. The virus came here because the federal government missed it. That’s what the CDC, the federal government, says today.
The governor got it right when he said earlier in the interview that the CDC ""says the virus came from Europe and the travel ban was too late."" That’s the main takeaway from the report. But the CDC didn’t say that ""Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York"" or that the federal government could have stopped the virus from coming to New York, as Cuomo suggests.
As we’ve written before — in looking at Trump’s unsupported claims that his restrictions on travel from China have saved ""hundreds of thousands"" of lives — the research on international travel limitations shows they can delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
We asked the governor’s press office for clarification on his remarks and what he believed the Trump administration could have done to stop the virus from coming to New York. We haven’t received a response.
What the CDC Said
The CDC report, released on July 16, used specimens collected by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene from March 1 through 20 at six hospital emergency rooms from patients with influenza-like symptoms who had tested negative for influenza. Of the 544 specimens, the CDC found 36 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC then used genetic sequencing and found the positive specimens in New York City mostly resembled the genetic sequences of the virus circulating in Europe.
""Using genetic sequencing, CDC determined that the sequences of most SARS-CoV-2–positive specimens resembled those circulating in Europe, suggesting probable introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from Europe, from other U.S. locations, and local introductions from within New York,"" the report said. ""These findings demonstrate that partnering with health care facilities and developing the systems needed for rapid implementation of sentinel surveillance, coupled with capacity for genetic sequencing before an outbreak, can help inform timely containment and mitigation strategies.""
The study also found that the earliest specimens, from March 2, weren’t connected to genome sequences from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019. This was ""unanticipated,"" the report said, because most of the emergency departments that collected the specimens were in ZIP codes with a high percentage of Chinese speakers.
The study suggests the virus spreading in New York City in March largely wasn’t affected by the federal government’s restrictions on travel to and from China, which were implemented on Feb. 2. Those restrictions said that non-U.S. citizens were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, but there were exceptions for citizens, permanent residents and the immediate family members of both.
While such travel policies ""are an important mitigation strategy,"" the CDC said, the subsequent restrictions on travel from Europe — imposed on March 13, with the same exceptions — came too late. ""[B]y the time the European restrictions were implemented, importation and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 had already occurred in NYC.""
Five days earlier, on March 8, the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had announced sustained community transmission of the virus. That week, there were 1,917 confirmed cases in the city, and the CDC’s report estimated there were another 1,170 undetected cases.
And by March 15, just two days after the travel restrictions on Europe went into effect, ""community transmission was widespread in New York City,"" the report said.
Limited testing availability and strict criteria harmed the ability to detect cases and slow the spread, the report further said.
""Expanding the testing criteria at the beginning of the outbreak to include persons with any travel exposure and with [influenza-like symptoms] without an alternative diagnosis would have increased the number of cases detected through passive surveillance,"" the CDC said. ""Limited testing capability and strict testing criteria led to many COVID-19 cases going undetected, slowed DOHMH’s capacity to use surveillance to make timely public health decisions, and ultimately contributed to sustained community transmission.""
The report does have at least six limitations, it said — most notably, the small number of patients, which ""led to large uncertainty in estimated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and the number of undetected COVID-19 cases in the target population.""
But the findings show the travel policies don’t appear to have made much of an impact — if any — on the virus’ arrival in New York City. And testing limitations further contributed to the spread of the virus. The CDC, however, doesn’t say, as Cuomo claimed, that ""Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York,"" or that a different strategy could have stopped the virus from coming.
The Impact of Travel Restrictions
""While it is true that banning travelers from China did not keep the virus out of the US, it is unrealistic to think that it would have been possible to implement expanded travel bans to try and stop the virus,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us in an email. ""It is very difficult to know in real time where in the world the virus is and this makes it near impossible to create a list of countries from which to ban travel. So far, all evidence suggests that no country has been successful in using travel bans to prevent the virus from entering its borders.""
Similarly, we found previously that studies of this pandemic as well as past research have shown travel restrictions can slow a virus’ spread but not stop it.
Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us in April when we looked into this issue that previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the policies have to be very strict to have an effect. Travel restrictions ""can have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,"" Omer said. But, ""even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.""
The U.S. travel restrictions were limited, of course, and so was testing for the virus generally.
Initially, the CDC testing criteria focused on those with symptoms who also had been to Wuhan or in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. By late February, those criteria included anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a severe acute lower respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced doctors could order tests if they thought one was needed. 
Nuzzo told us previously that in February, other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren’t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. ""would likely not have picked it up"" if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries were infected with the virus ""because we weren’t using these other countries as criteria for testing,"" she said.
And the U.S. wasn’t using travel from European countries as criteria for testing, either. But it’s worth noting, there weren’t many confirmed cases in Europe in late February.
A report by European researchers said that on Feb. 21 there were just 47 confirmed cases in nine European countries (not including another nine cases in the United Kingdom). Nearly two weeks later, on March 5, the number had grown significantly, to 4,250 cases, and 113 deaths, among 38 countries in the World Health Organization’s European region.
The CDC’s July report indicates that expanded testing — ""to include persons with any travel exposure"" and flu-like symptoms — could have aided public health officials in their decision-making and potentially reduced the community transmission.
We asked Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse whether the Trump administration could have done anything to stop the virus from coming to New York. He agreed that it’s unlikely any policy could have stopped the introduction of the virus entirely.
""I’m not surprised that New York, a crossroads of the world, would be at high risk, and we don’t know which of the several introductions took root and which fizzled out,"" Morse said in an email. ""With the type of genomic work described in the paper, it becomes more possible to make these distinctions now. Since we’re not yet very good at foretelling the future, I think the data are very informative to us scientists, but the main goal should still be to stop spread and establishment of an infection as soon as we possibly can. Period.""
Morse said Cuomo and New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard A. Zucker ""deserve the great credit they’ve gotten for taking this seriously and usually acting accordingly, and communicating appropriately."" But he also said he has been ""stunned and disheartened by the total lack of seriousness and urgency with which most western countries have treated this outbreak.""
""There were numerous missed opportunities for the pandemic to be slowed or possibly even stopped,"" he said. Travel restrictions targeting Wuhan ""might have had some value if carried out well"" and ""[v]ery early on."" But once people infected with the virus had traveled to other places around the world, ""such focused measures were no longer feasible.""
A testing and tracing policy is ""more effective the earlier you can do it,"" he said. ""With more infections, and additional dispersion, the complexity of the work increases astronomically, and it’s not really sustainable. … I would suggest, based on the current situation, we wouldn’t be any better off now if the virus (even with all we know about it and all our tools) arrived today, instead of early 2020, and doubt we’d be any more effective at stopping it.""
All that said, it’s clear from the CDC report that the U.S. travel restrictions did little to mitigate infections traced to Europe from spreading in New York City, and the report notes that limitations in testing ability ""contributed to sustained community transmission."" But Cuomo goes too far in claiming that the CDC said ""Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York."" The report did not say the virus could have been stopped from coming to New York entirely.

		Quick Take
Social media posts claim that Betsy DeVos said ""only"" 0.02% of children are ""likely to die"" of COVID-19 from schools reopening in the fall. There’s no evidence she ever said that.


Full Story 
As a new school year approaches amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has been publicly advocating for a full reopening of K-12 schools across the country, drawing critics who say the move stands to risk the health of children and teachers.
But across social media platforms, that criticism has taken the form of a fictitious quote attributed to DeVos concerning how many children could die as a result of reopening.
""Betsy DeVos said ‘only’ .02% of kids are likely to die when they go back to school during the pandemic,"" reads a meme shared on Facebook. ""That’s 14,740 children.""
The claim also appeared on Instagram and a July 12 tweet spreading the falsehood was retweeted nearly 70,000 times. In some cases, the quote is dated July 10.
But we could find no public comments in which DeVos made that remark on that day — or any other. Nor could our fact-checking friends at Lead Stories and Snopes.
DeVos did partake in several interviews, including on CNN and Fox News, on July 12, in which she pressed for schools to reopen and said that young people contract the virus at lower rates than their adult counterparts.
""We know that children get the virus at a far lower rate than any other part of the population,"" she told CNN’s Dana Bash.
An April report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that among nearly 150,000 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases for which age was known, less than 2% were children under age 18.
The CDC also cites a study of pediatric patients with COVID-19 conducted in China, which found that the vast majority of cases in children were either ""mild"" or ""moderate."" Of the patients studied, 5% were ""severe"" and 0.6% were ""critical.""
In rare cases, children with COVID-19 have developed a serious illness known as multisystem inflammation syndrome, or MIS-C.
Still, there are many unanswered questions about the rates in which children get and transmit the virus — especially since asymptomatic cases are less likely to be tested. 
As for the supposed statistic in the viral posts, we found no instances of DeVos citing any such figure in her interviews or other public appearances. So it’s not clear how the ""‘only’ 0.02%"" quote came to be.
We did come across a different viral Facebook text post, published on July 8, that also made reference to DeVos and tied a different figure to another administration official.
That post claimed that Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said that ""most children probably won’t die. Maybe 0.1%."" But that too was an inaccurate retelling of what Birx said at a July 8 task force press briefing (at which DeVos was also present).
When a reporter asked her about COVID-19 and children, including the infection rate among children, Birx said that of the tests performed ""the lowest-tested portion is the under-10-year-olds. So we’re putting into place other ways to get testing results from them and looking at antibody in that discarded samples, and try to really figure this out, because parents have really done an amazing job of protecting their children.""
She also said ""our data is skewed originally to people with symptoms, and then skewed to adults over 18. And so we are looking very closely into that category by using our antibody tests.""
Birx went on to add: ""We know the mortality rate in under 25 from the CDC data is less than 0.1 percent. And so that has been holding. But until we know how many have been infected, we have no evidence that there is significant mortality in children without coexisting diseases. And that’s what we’re looking for right now, is to really make sure we’ve … overturned every rock and understand that in deep detail.""
So even Birx’s actual quote does not resemble the one that is now being baselessly attributed to DeVos.
It is also unclear how the viral claim calculates that 0.02% of the U.S. school population is ""14,740 children."" Federal figures project there will be 56,678,000 children in public and private schools in Fall 2020; 0.02% of that population would be 11,336 students.

		After President Donald Trump said, ""I don’t know anything about"" the disbanding of a White House pandemic response office, the Democrats claimed that he ""lied"" and pointed to Trump’s earlier remarks about ""some of the people we cut"" as evidence. But those remarks were in response to a question about proposed budget cuts — not the anti-pandemic team in question.
Several Democrats have criticized the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak by pointing to the dissolving of a team within the White House’s National Security Council dedicated to coordinating a response to a pandemic. As we’ve written before, in 2018, the administration did eliminate a key position that would have been involved in such a response — the senior director of the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense. But that doesn’t mean the responsibilities of that office were eliminated.
Administration officials have described a reorganization or streamlining of the NSC. An NSC spokesman told the Washington Post in May 2018 that the administration ""will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.""
Some still have been critical of the elimination of the post or a separate global health team. For instance, the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended in a November 2019 report restoring the position on the NSC as one of seven key changes to better protect the American public from global health threats.
In a March 13 press conference, the president was asked ""what responsibility do you take"" for the ""disband[ing]"" of the White House pandemic office, and he responded that he ""didn’t know anything about it.""
""And when you say ‘me,’ I didn’t do it,"" the president said. ""I could ask perhaps — my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it. I mean, you say — you say we did that. I don’t know anything about it.""
(Trump’s mention of ""Tony"" was a reference to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.)
The reporter made clear she was talking about ""the reorganization that happened at the National Security Council,"" and Trump added: ""It’s the — it’s the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go.""
The next day, March 14, the Democratic National Committee tweeted: ""Yesterday, Trump said he didn’t disband the government’s pandemic response team. He lied. Here he is earlier this year defending doing just that.""
The accompanying video showed Trump saying: ""Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. And if — if we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person — I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.""
But those remarks came in a Feb. 26 press conference after Trump was asked about his proposed budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization.
Reporter, Feb. 26: Your budgets have consistently called for enormous cuts to the CDC, the NIH, and the WHO. You’ve talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent, have been critical and necessary. Does this experience at all give you pause about those consistent cuts?
Trump: No, because we — we can get money and we can increase staff. We know all the people. We know all the good people. It’s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. And if — if we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person — I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them.
When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we’re bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this, you know, great government that we have, and very specifically for this. We can build up very, very quickly. And we’ve already done that. I mean, we really have built up. We have a great staff.
Trump doesn’t say to whom he’s referring in talking about staffing cuts, but the question was about his proposed budget cuts, not the National Security Council global health security team. The NSC was not mentioned in the reporter’s question or Trump’s answer.
As we’ve said before, Trump has consistently proposed budgets that would cut funding for the CDC and NIH, but Congress hasn’t enacted those proposals. The CDC’s staff has decreased by 591 positions, or 5.4%, from December 2016 through March 2019, the most recent data available from the Office of Personnel Management.
Daniel Wessel, a spokesperson for the DNC, told us that Trump didn’t answer the question that was asked and was likely talking about the NSC issue, which had been in the news that day.
""Trump was not answering the question that he was asked, so we should not be held to the standard of what the question was,"" he said in an email. ""Trump’s response on the day that headlines were breaking about the decision by his NSC to cut the pandemic response team was just as likely (probably more likely) about the pandemic response team than anything else.""
Wessel added that the point of whether Trump ""lied … is moot,"" saying there have been several news stories ""that showed Trump’s administration and NSC led by John Bolton did indeed dismantle the pandemic response team in the spring of 2018.""
Zach Parkinson, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told us: ""As the full video makes clear, at no point in this exchange was the National Security Council or the Global Health Security Directorate team mentioned. The President was specifically asked about his proposed budgets, not any personnel reorganization or actions.""
Parkinson also said the claim that the NSC team was eliminated is ""false,"" saying, ""former and current National Security Council officials have repeatedly said the team working on biodefense is still at the NSC.""
Others on Twitter, including celebrities and journalists, have retweeted a March 17 article by the Independent, a U.K. publication, that also linked Trump’s Feb. 26 remarks to the NSC issue. The Democratic group Protect Our Care pointed to that article and wrongly said Trump made these comments ""in 2018.""
The Atlantic, also citing the Independent story, initially said the president’s remarks were from 2018 but later corrected that.
The Independent story didn’t say the video was from two years ago but may have left that impression. ""A video has emerged of Donald Trump talking about cutting the US pandemic response team in 2018,"" it said. The date pertains to the cutting, not the video, which is merely a few weeks old.
What Happened with the NSC Team?
As we explained in a March 3 story, the administration did eliminate a key position at the NSC but that doesn’t mean the entire ""team"" was ""fired,"" as then-Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg said, or that all of the functions of the office were eliminated.
The Washington Post reported in May 2018 that then-National Security Adviser John Bolton dissolved the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in a reorganization effort. Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer left his post as senior director of that office and wasn’t replaced.
President Barack Obama had created the NSC unit in 2016 after the yearslong Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Trump appointed Ziemer as senior director in April 2017, but Ziemer left about a year later. He now serves as senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance at USAID.
The Post said this was part of a ""reorganization"" by Bolton and quoted an NSC spokesman as saying ""global health, global health security and biodefense"" would be addressed ""under the new structure."" The Atlantic also reported at the time that some team members were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of Ziemer’s duties. 
Tom Bossert, a former White House homeland security adviser who helped develop the Trump administration’s biodefense strategy and was the designated lead for coordinating the American response to a biological crisis, was also reportedly pushed out of the NSC when Bolton took over. Bossert resigned in April 2018, a day after Bolton started as national security adviser.
Bossert was replaced with a series of people, but when Trump announced his coronavirus task force on Jan. 29, he did not name current homeland security adviser Julia Nesheiwat in any capacity.
Bolton, as well as Tim Morrison, former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense for the NSC, also have described the moves as a restructuring or consolidation. What was the Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense became part of the directorate on counterproliferation and biodefense.
Morrison objected to claims that the office was ""dissolved,"" writing in the Post on March 16 that the administration ""create[d] the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one, given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense. It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented.""
Morrison led that directorate for a year, he wrote, before leaving that position. Another official replaced him, he said. The administration has decreased staffing at the NSC, something Morrison said was needed after ""bloat"" under the previous administration.
We didn’t get a statement from the White House when we asked about the NSC issue, but the Washington Post Fact Checker did. NSC spokesman John Ullyot told the Post: ""No director-level positions were eliminated during this process, and the organization retained its subject matter expertise under a different organizational structure.""
Some have said the NSC needs a separate global health security point person or team — as the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended. That’s a matter of opinion, and we take no position on that.
Three days before Morrison’s op-ed, Beth Cameron, former senior director for the old NSC team — the global health security and biodefense office — wrote in the Post that disbanding that directorate ""left an unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.""
Democratic senators had questioned the move at the time, as well as former government officials.
Kenneth W. Bernard, who served in both former President Bill Clinton’s and President George W. Bush’s administrations, wrote in 2018 that this was the third time that an administration had ""downgraded the importance of disease and bioterrorism threats in the hierarchy of national security issues."" Bernard said he worked in such a post in 1998 but the Bush administration abolished it in 2001, then reopened it a year later after 9/11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks. He said Obama abolished it again after his election, but in his second term created the NSC office.
Bolton responded to the recent criticism on Twitter on March 14, saying: ""Claims that streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation’s bio defense are false. Global health remained a top NSC priority, and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018-19 Africa Ebola crisis.""
Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly and Republican Rep. Steve Chabot have introduced a bill that would require that the president create a global health security interagency council and ""appoint an employee of the National Security Council, serving at the senior director level or higher, to serve as Chair for the Council.""
Connolly asked Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a March 11 hearing whether it was a ""mistake"" to ""dismantle"" the office in the NSC devoted to global health and security. Fauci responded: ""I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there.""
We take no position on whether it was a mistake or not to eliminate the global health security post or restructure the NSC team. But it’s wrong for Democrats to cite Trump’s remarks about ""some of the people we cut"" as proof that he ""lied"" about not knowing what happened to the NSC team.

		Quick Take
Viral posts on social media falsely claim that a House bill would ""give the government the power to forcibly remove"" children from their homes. That’s not true. The bill actually provides $100 billion to fund COVID-19 contact tracing efforts. 


Full Story 
A House bill that would fund organizations to trace and prevent COVID-19 infections has fueled a number of false and misleading claims on social media.
One of the most egregious misrepresentations is the suggestion that it would implement forced removals of children from their homes.
A bogus Facebook post, for example, claims the bill — unfortunately numbered H.R. 6666 — ""will give the government the power to forcibly remove your family members from your home and quarantine them[.] That includes your children.""
A viral YouTube video similarly claims the legislation would ""allow individuals to come into your house"" and, if you have COVID-19 symptoms or test positive, ""pull you or your loved ones, especially your children, away under pretense of public safety.""
But there is nothing in the bill’s current language dealing with forced removals, or giving anyone the authority to simply enter people’s homes without consent to conduct tests.
The bill — the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act — outlines a $100 billion program to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award grants to ""eligible entities,"" such as health centers and clinics, universities and nonprofit organizations.
The federal money would be used by those organizations ""to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through— (1) mobile health units; and (2) as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.""
Those provisions support the concept of contact tracing, a public health technique that, as we’ve previously explained, involves identifying those who have had contact with an infected person so that those people can be warned and ideally tested or quarantined.
According to the bill, the funds would be used by the recipient organizations ""to hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of individuals"" and to ""purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies."" Organizations in hot spots — areas with cases of the novel coronavirus higher than the national average — and those in ""medically underserved communities"" would be given priority.
David Studdert, a Stanford University professor of law and medicine, told us in an email that ""there is nothing in the text of the bill"" supporting the claim about forced removals. He pointed to the bill’s language that explicitly supports ""testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences."" (Emphasis ours.)
The CDC calls contact tracing a ""key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19,"" and many public health experts have cited it as an important component, too.
An April report by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, for example, said a ""case-based intervention approach … will be impossible to achieve for COVID-19 without a new national initiative that combines a massive expansion of rapid diagnostic tests in every community with an unprecedented growth in a public health workforce and adoption of new technologies dedicated to case identification and contact tracing in each state.""
""In order to trace all contacts, safely isolate the sick, and quarantine those exposed, we estimate that our public health workforce needs to add approximately 100,000 (paid or volunteer) contact tracers to assist with this large-scale effort,"" the report says.
It’s worth noting that existing state laws — and, to a lesser extent, federal law and regulations — already provide the government the authority to mandate quarantine or isolation to curb the spread of communicable diseases. But they’re not without limits or challenges.
""In broad strokes, the state can involuntarily isolate a person who is both sick and dangerous to the community,"" Nicole Huberfeld, a Boston University professor of health law, ethics and human rights, told us in an email. ""A number of judicial decisions have been issued over time that pertain to isolating a person who has, for example, drug-resistant TB, and they consistently have held that the person must have both characteristics to be lawfully held.""
""Additionally, courts consistently have held that government must meet both procedural requirements and substantive requirements to involuntarily isolate a person,"" she said.
Huberfeld said ""courts apply procedural due process standards"" afforded under the Constitution to ensure they have a right to understand and oppose the decision before commitment. She added that the state must meet the ""substantive standards"" under the Fourth Amendment, too — ""meaning that government bears the burden of proving a person is both ill and dangerous to the community before she could be involuntarily isolated to avoid running afoul of the prohibition against ‘unreasonable seizure.'""
Someone forced to isolate retains the right to refuse medical treatment, Huberfeld noted, though that could potentially prolong the isolation.
None of this is changed by the current language in H.R. 6666 — which was introduced May 1 and is still before a House committee. As we said, there is no language in the bill proposing to ""forcibly remove"" individuals or children. And Huberfeld said the legislation does not affect the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable search and seizures — meaning contact tracers wouldn’t be able to just enter homes without consent to conduct tests, as the YouTube video suggests.
The bill’s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, has attempted to counter misconceptions about the bill on Twitter.
In a radio and Facebook Live interview on May 12, Rush said (at 1:17:12): ""It’s all volunteer. There’s nothing about this bill that says that the government is going to come into your home and snatch your children … or snatch you out of the home. There’s nothing that remotely even hints at that.""
Another erroneous post claims the bill will give funding only to entities that ""agree by contract that they will only allow people in their facilities that have the covid 19 vaccination, are tested and tracked."" There is no mention of vaccines, let alone contracts stipulating mandatory vaccinations, in the bill.

      False Claim of Deadly Coronavirus Vaccine Trial in Africa

		Quick Take
Posts across social media are falsely claiming that a vaccine trial for the novel coronavirus in Senegal resulted in the death of seven children. The video behind those claims does not show that. And there is no clinical trial for a potential vaccine currently taking place in Senegal.


Full Story 
There is no vaccine developed yet for the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, though some clinical tests for potential vaccines are underway in the U.S. and China.
But a falsehood circulating across social media platforms — spread through numerous posts, headlines and screenshots — is wrongly purporting that seven children in Senegal died after being given an experimental vaccine for the virus.
""Mass vaccination for COVID-19 in Senegal was started yesterday (4/8) and the first 7 CHILDREN who received it DIED on the spot,"" a Facebook post reads. An Instagram post from an account called ""bye_bye_big_pharma"" says that ""CV vaccine tested in patients in Africa started yesterday. (4/8/2020) It was passed without any animal safety studies. 7 children died on the spot after injection.""
That’s not true.

There is no clinical trial currently underway in that country, or anywhere in Africa, according to a list of vaccine candidates compiled for the scientific journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. As of April 8, there were 115 candidates worldwide — and while 78 were confirmed as active, only five are in the clinical trial phase. Those five trials are happening in the U.S. and China.
The false claim appears to stem from a viral video that shows a crowd of people in a street near a police car. A French speaker in the video tells of a ""serious scandal in Senegal."" Sharon Bell, an assistant professor of French translation at Kent State University, translated the video for FactCheck.org.
The speaker claims that ""a guy … went into a house to vaccinate children against the problem of Coronavirus, the COVID-19. He vaccinated seven people, children. Seven children. They immediately died. They dropped dead."" It further says the police are on the scene.
But the speaker’s claims evidently were added to the original video, which told a very different story.
AFP Senegal found the video in a late March news report in that country — and it didn’t say that anybody had died. Instead, the video appeared in a story about the alleged arrest of two individuals claiming they had vaccines.
That video — which is in Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal — does not claim that any children died, according to Omar Ka, an associate professor of modern languages, linguistics and intercultural communication at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
""The difference between the French version and the Wolof one is that the latter does not talk about children being killed,"" Ka told us in an email. ""It simply states that an individual was caught trying to vaccinate people for COVID-19 and he was chased away, finding refuge at the neighborhood leader’s (Chef de Quartier, in French) house.""
Ka said that in the beginning of the French version, ""you can clearly overhear the Wolof narrator, but he gets quickly overtaken by the French-speaking narrator."" The French version, he said, ""definitely is not a translation of the Wolof version"" — he said it adds more dramatic details, ""talking about seven kids killed and the need in return to kill the individual.""
Multiple government agencies told AFP Senegal that one Senegalese man (not two people) was briefly arrested on March 26 in Dalifort, an area in the country’s capital of Dakar, and that he was selling cosmetics and hadn’t actually tried to vaccinate anyone. An armed forces ministry spokesman said the mishap occurred because the man was wearing a health ministry T-shirt and jokingly said he had vaccines, causing a stir. Police found that he only had cosmetic products.
One website in Ghana, ezone57.com, ran the video under the headline: ""Coronavirus: COVID-19 Vaccine Killed 7 Children in Senegal(West Africa) [VIDEO]."" That post garnered considerable attention, and its headline appeared in screenshots on Facebook, before the website took down the story and published another debunking the claim.
The falsehood circulated amid news reports about controversial remarks made by two French doctors who suggested vaccine trials should be conducted in Africa.
World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus referred to those comments as ""racist,"" saying during an April 6 press conference that ""Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.""
""We will follow all the rules to test any vaccines or therapeutics all over the world using exactly the same rule,"" he said. ""Whether it’s in Europe, Africa or wherever — we will use the same protocol.""
""The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop,"" he said.

		Quick Take
Social media posts are spreading a quote falsely attributed to President Donald Trump about the coronavirus. He didn’t say, ""People are dying who have never died before."" But Ernest Hemingway did.

Full Story
A quote falsely attributed to President Donald Trump has spread widely online, ratcheting up animosity over his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.
One popular version of the claim on Facebook features a picture of Trump and says: ""‘People are dying who have never died before.’ – Donald J. Trump, March 18, 2020.""
Other versions claim the date was March 17.
But we could find no record of Trump having ever said that.
A review of his appearances on March 17 and 18 shows that he made no such remark. On March 17 he gave a press briefing with his Coronavirus Task Force and met with executives from the tourism industry. On March 18 he gave another press briefing with his task force and met with representatives of major nurses’ organizations. In none of those appearances did he make such a statement.
The quote itself is real, though.
Author Ernest Hemingway was fond of using that phrase, according to a biography of American writer Glenway Wescott. The writer of that biography, Jerry Rosco, told us that detail came from Mary Hemingway’s autobiography, ""How It Was.""
So, Trump hasn’t said it, but someone has.

A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that state-issued mask mandates were associated with significant decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates. Yet some conservative outlets and social media users falsely claim the study shows mask mandates have a negligible impact on COVID-19 outcomes.

Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Lab tests, for example, show that masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Analyses of people who came into contact with those with COVID-19 have also found mask-wearing to be associated with a reduced risk of contracting the virus. Numerous studies similarly document an association between self-reported mask wearing and control of the virus in a community or the implementation of a mask mandate and a subsequent decline in COVID-19 cases.
While each of these study types has its limitations, collectively, most experts agree that masks are likely to reduce transmission of the coronavirus and should be used by members of the public when around other people. Some research also indicates face masks can protect the wearer as well.
Masks, however, should not be viewed as fool-proof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. For optimal performance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people select masks that are well-fitting and multi-layered.

Full Story
The growth rates of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths slowed significantly in counties where states required masks, according to a study that analyzed the impacts of last year’s state-issued mask mandates across the country. 
The findings support the premise that mask requirements help limit the potential exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which therefore reduces the spread of the disease, COVID-19. But conservative outlets and social media users turned those findings around to say the CDC found face masks have a ""negligible impact"" on COVID-19 outcomes and that mask mandates ""made no statistical difference.""
A story published by One America News Network, a conservative cable channel, on March 7, falsely claimed the CDC ""has admitted face masks do little to prevent the spread"" of the virus and that the numbers in the study ""didn’t exceed statistical margins of error."" The story has been seen by over 230,000 users on Facebook.
A CDC spokesperson told us that’s not correct. 
""The data we now have conclusively show that widespread use of masks is a very effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19,"" said CDC’s Jasmine Reed in an email. ""The CDC study referenced noted that mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.""  
What the Study Found
The new study cites and builds upon previous studies that have confirmed the effectiveness of mask mandates and restaurant closures in reducing COVID-19 outcomes. In this case, CDC scientists examined the association of state-issued mask mandates and on-premises restaurant dining with COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 1 to Dec. 31, 2020. To do so, it looked at data from 2,313 U.S. counties (73.6% of a total 3,142) where mask mandates were implemented and from the 3,076 (97.9%) U.S. counties that allowed restaurants to reopen, and compared that data with county-level changes in COVID-19 case and death growth rates. 
The CDC says the study controlled for some variables such as restaurant closures in the mask mandates models and mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models, as well as bar closures, stay-at-home orders, and bans of gatherings. But it did not control for other policies that could affect case and death rates, such as closure of other types of businesses and physical distancing recommendations. It didn’t account for the level of compliance and enforcement of the policies, either, and it did not make a difference between dining conditions, such as indoor or outdoor, in restaurants. 
The study found that mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease in daily COVID-19 case growth rates within the first 20 days. The reductions in growth rates increased with time, reaching 1.1, 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8 percentage points within 21 to 40, 41 to 60, 61 to 80, and 81 to 100 days, respectively, after implementation.
The study also found reopening restaurants was associated with a statistically significant increase in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates 41 days after implementation, with 2.2 and 3.0 percentage point increases in the death growth rate 61 to 80 and 81 to 100 days after restrictions were lifted. 
""What they found was that one or the other, or both, all of them, were associated with a reduction in incidence rates,"" Dr. Sten H. Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, told us in a phone interview. 
Yet, shortly after the study was first published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report online on March 5, the information got distorted.
How Growth Rate Finding Was Distorted
On March 6, Fox News’ Laura Ingraham tweeted that the study found mask mandates and restaurant restrictions ""have a small impact"" on COVID-19 cases and deaths. Later that day, an unreliable Twitter account called Breaking911 created a tweet thread about the new study, falsely claiming that it found ""mask mandates lower COVID cases by around 1.5% over a two month period."" 
But as we already explained, the study is not showing a decrease in the number of cases and deaths but a decrease in the growth rate of the daily cases and deaths. 
""Because the growth rate is exponential,"" the impact compounds, José Luis Jiménez, an analytical and atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the study, told us. ""So, it’s kind of like your mortgage — you change your interest a little bit, and then you save a ton of money. Because the cases compound.""
The authors of the study did not respond to an interview request from FactCheck.org. But the CDC’s Gery P. Guy Jr., the lead author, told the Associated Press that although those changes in daily growth rates may sound small, they quickly add up. 
""Each day that growth rate is going down, the cumulative effect — in terms of cases and deaths — adds up to be quite substantial,"" Guy told the AP.
For example, if cases were growing at 5% per day and that growth rate dropped to 3.5% per day, the total number of cases could shrink substantially, particularly over time. 
Vermund told FactCheck.org since the results show changes in the daily growth rate they are ""much more impressive"" than they may appear. 
""This is actually quite a large effect, the opposite of what the scurrilous journalist said,"" Vermund told us, referring to the OAN story.
Neysa Ernst, nurse manager at Johns Hopkins Medicine’s biocontainment unit, told us the study results are not only statistically significant, but also clinically significant. She’s been on the front lines of caring for COVID-19 patients and says every percentage point change means a lot for units like hers and overwhelmed emergency departments across the country. 
""Every percentage point has someone’s family member attached to that,"" she said in a phone interview.
Other Distortions of the Study
OAN News, and other posts published during the last two weeks, also falsely claimed that the results of the study were ""inside the margin for statistical error"" or that ""mask mandates made no statistical difference."" They misunderstood a line of the study that says ""daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.""
But the ""reference period"" is 20 days before implementation of mask mandates.
The cherry-picked quote from the study merely says there wasn’t a significant difference in the daily case and death growth rates during three time periods before implementation, not after. As Guy explained to the AP, the study looked at growth rates before implementation to make sure there wasn’t already a trend happening before the mask mandates were put into place. 
The study did find ""statistically significant decreases"" after implementation of the mandates.
Vermund said these so-called pre-post analyses, which look at trends before and after you change something, are a very common way of looking at whether an intervention in a community did benefit or harm. The problem with them, he said, is that there may be other factors in the community that also change at the same time. But he said that’s less of a problem when you are looking at short timeframe, like this study does.
The OAN story, with the headline ""CDC: Face Masks Don’t Prevent COVID-19, Study Finds Masks Have Negligible Impact On Coronavirus Numbers,"" misinterprets the study even further by claiming the growth rate reductions apply to mask efficacy.
""The masks were 0.5 percent effective in the first 20 days of the mandates and less than 2 percent effective after 100 days,"" it says. 
But the CDC spokesperson said ""the study did not examine the effectiveness of masks.""
Vermund said the lack of the actual number of cases reduced or lives saved by mask mandates makes the CDC study a little difficult to understand for the public. Still, he said, the OAN story was ""completely misrepresentative.""
""They don’t understand anything about epidemiology,"" he said. ""The fact that you see a significant slowing of the growth rate in such a minuscule length of time — that’s not negligible.""
Jiménez, who is an expert in aerosols and has been working since the beginning of the pandemic to demonstrate that the virus travels through the air, told us the results of the study are significant and important because it looks at the general public, instead of results in a laboratory. 
The results would have been even stronger, he said, if people had used masks in a more effective way early on. But the science of face masks has slowly evolved, and the study analyzed data from last year when most of the population was not using masks properly. Still, he said, the results are robust.
""Masks are essential,"" Jiménez said. ""And how could they not be for a virus that we breathe in.""
Vermund agrees. He said there’s no question about the efficacy of masks in reducing COVID-19, based on what he called overwhelming evidence from other studies. What’s interesting about this study, he said, is to see that in a real-world setting. 
""This was just sort of a real-world assessment that in real world use, the way people use or misuse masks, is it really worth it? And the conclusion is that it’s definitely worth it because you reduce the speed of growth of the epidemic, you start to blunt the magnitude of the epidemic,"" he said. 
The CDC recognized the study’s limitations; nonetheless, it concludes that policies that require universal mask use and prohibit dining at restaurants are important tools, along with ""other public health strategies,"" to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

		White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has promoted the ""astonishing"" results of an observational study that found hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality for patients hospitalized for COVID-19. But the study has limitations, and multiple randomized controlled trials have found the drug is not beneficial to hospitalized patients.
In a July 7 press conference, Navarro highlighted the results of a study from the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan, saying it ""showed an astonishing 50% reduction in the mortality rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine,"" and that ""importantly, the study was based on what’s called early treatment.""
Minutes earlier in a CNN interview, Navarro, who is an assistant to the president and director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, also referenced the study, saying of hydroxychloroquine: ""It appears to work … in a very significant way,"" adding, ""It will save lives.""
Outside experts, however, dispute the notion that the Henry Ford study treated its patients much earlier than other studies, and are skeptical of its findings, as they clash with every other rigorously performed study testing the drug against the coronavirus.
""All the evidence points to [hydroxychloroquine] not being effective for improving mortality outcomes in the hospital,"" said Eli Rosenberg, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the State University of New York’s University at Albany, who has conducted a hydroxychloroquine study. ""So this definitely stands quite at odds with where all the science currently is.""
Navarro also announced that based on the new findings, physicians from Henry Ford were petitioning the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine for early hospitalized COVID-19 patients, outpatients and for prophylaxis, or prevention.
The health system confirmed in a statement to FactCheck.org that it had ""formally asked the FDA for reconsideration of their Emergency Use Authorization of the drug for a clearly defined list of clinical uses, including use in clinical trials,"" but did not answer additional questions about the request.
Because hydroxychloroquine is approved for other uses, physicians can legally prescribe the drug for any reason, but without the EUA, the drug cannot be obtained from the Strategic National Stockpile.
The FDA previously revoked its hydroxychloroquine EUA for hospitalized patients on June 15, citing the findings of a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K., among other evidence. The agency determined that the drug was unlikely to be effective and the potential benefits of its use no longer outweighed the risks, given the possibility of serious cardiac side effects.
Navarro, notably, did not mention that three randomized controlled trials — considered the highest level of evidence in science — all failed to find that hydroxychloroquine benefits patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
The Henry Ford study, which was published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases on July 1, looked back at the outcomes of 2,541 patients who were admitted to the hospital system and were given hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin, both drugs or neither. It was observational and did not randomize patients to treatment groups, nor did it blind patients or physicians to the medications that were given.
In touting the new study, Navarro also gave the misleading impression that the bulk of the evidence favors hydroxychloroquine, which is an antimalarial that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
""There’s over 60 studies that we’ve looked at on a spreadsheet. Fifty of them support the therapeutic or prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine,"" he said. ""The 11 that don’t, a good number of those are discredited studies.""
We asked the White House for the spreadsheet or its contents, but did not receive a reply. There is one retracted study, published in the Lancet on May 22, that claimed hydroxychloroquine did not benefit hospitalized COVID-19 patients and may have increased mortality. Those conclusions, however, were based on registry data from the company Surgisphere, which other scientists found highly suspicious and did not match up with government reports. Three of the authors retracted the paper about two weeks later when the underlying data could not be verified.
But as we’ve written, numerous other investigations — including the strongest studies — have consistently found that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Although the results are not yet published, the RECOVERY trial in the U.K., which included 1,542 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 3,132 patients receiving usual care, found no difference in survival nor improvement in hospital stay or other outcomes.
""These data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19,"" the investigators said in a June 5 press release that also announced the end of the hydroxychloroquine part of the trial.
""Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs,"" said Dr. Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford and the trial’s lead investigator.
The National Institutes of Health announced on June 20 that it, too, was halting its hydroxychloroquine trial in hospitalized patients, known as ORCHID, after a data and safety monitoring board reviewed interim data. 
While hydroxychloroquine was not harmful, the board concluded the drug was ""very unlikely to be beneficial"" to hospitalized patients, according to the agency’s news release. The trial was a blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, and at the time of closure, included more than 470 enrollees who were currently hospitalized or expected to be hospitalized for COVID-19.
The NIH told us by email that investigators were continuing to follow participants and were working toward publication, although given follow-up and time to analyze data, this might take a couple months.
On June 17, the World Health Organization also suspended the hydroxychloroquine arm of its randomized controlled trial, known as Solidarity, given lack of efficacy in hospitalized patients.
On July 4, the WHO officially accepted the trial’s steering committee’s decision to discontinue the hydroxychloroquine arm based on the interim results and other trials, noting that the interim findings show that hydroxychloroquine produces ""little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard of care."" 
The agency said the findings were being ""readied"" for peer-reviewed publication and that its decision does not apply to hydroxychloroquine trials in non-hospitalized patients or those testing the drug for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.
Indeed, other trials are still in the works regarding outpatient treatment and prevention, including a very large prevention trial among front-line workers at Henry Ford. The first two randomized controlled trials to announce results on hydroxychloroquine as a preventive, however, have not shown any benefit, including one trial from the University of Minnesota and another in Barcelona, Spain.
In addition to Navarro, President Donald Trump, who has long backed hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 despite a lack of evidence — and even claimed to take the drug — cheered the Henry Ford findings. On July 6, he shared snippets of the study’s press release in tweets, and later suggested that he had been vindicated.
""The highly respected Henry Ford Health System just reported, based on a large sampling, that HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE cut the death rate in certain sick patients very significantly,"" he said in a tweet. ""The Dems disparaged it for political reasons (me!). Disgraceful. Act now,"" he added, tagging the FDA.
We’ll review the Henry Ford findings and put them in context with the other results to give a more complete picture of where hydroxychloroquine really stands.
Observational Study With Some Oddities
In the Henry Ford study, 18.1% of all patients died in the hospital, compared with 13.5% who received hydroxychloroquine, 22.4% who received azithromycin, 20.1% who received both drugs and 26.4% who received neither. 
After controlling for demographics, various risk factors and some markers of disease severity, the authors found that getting hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduced risk of death. 
In another similar analysis, in which the authors matched 190 patients who received hydroxychloroquine with 190 corresponding patients who did not get the drug, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a 51% reduction in the risk of death.
Experts, however, said that because the study was not a randomized trial, it’s difficult to know whether the effect the study’s authors identified is real.
""The concern with any retrospective observational cohort,"" explained Dr. David Boulware, a professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota Medical School, ""is selection bias."" 
""The question is, the people who got the medicine, are they the same as the people who didn’t get the medicine,"" he said. ""They try to control for that, they do multivariable adjustments and things like that, but there’s still things you can’t totally control statistically to try to compensate for how physicians act.""
In particular, several scientists suspect that the patients who didn’t get hydroxychloroquine may have been more likely to be sicker or more frail and less likely to get as much treatment.
The first clue comes from the fact that while the hospital system seemed to give most patients hydroxychloroquine according to its standardized protocol, a sizable chunk did not receive it.
""When you have a protocol in your hospital and many patients aren’t following the protocol, it makes you think that there’s something different about those patients,"" said Dr. Neil Schluger, chair of the department of medicine at New York Medical College, and senior author of another observational study of hydroxychloroquine. ""So the comparison right away becomes a little bit problematic.""
Some patients with cardiac issues were excluded from receiving hydroxychloroquine, given safety concerns of the drug. While that’s a reasonable clinical decision, University at Albany’s Rosenberg said, it’s unclear if that meant those patients ended up in the no treatment group in the study.
""They took those people out who have these elevated risks of mortality,"" he said. ""That will alter the analysis in a fundamental way.""
Another hint: Hydroxychloroquine patients were more likely to be ventilated and enter the ICU, but were less likely to die than those who didn’t get the drug — even though being ventilated and admitted to the ICU are risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes.
""That’s very curious,"" Rosenberg said, adding that it suggests that many patients who didn’t get hydroxychloroquine might have been in a ""low medical intervention situation,"" such as having end-of-life orders.
""Why did more patients who got hydroxychloroquine go to the ICU?"" Schluger asked. ""It makes you think those patients were treated more aggressively than patients who didn’t get hydroxychloroquine.""
A commentary published with the Henry Ford article also hit upon this counterintuitive result. ""Were the decision to withhold treatment related to poor prognosis (e.g. palliative intent), it stands to reason that patients receiving neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin would have the highest mortality,"" the authors wrote. ""Indeed, the non-treated group had an overall mortality that was higher than the rate of admission to the ICU (26.4% vs. 15.2%), suggesting that many patients were not considered appropriate for critical care.""
Along similar lines, the commentary authors, who were physicians and researchers in Canada and Australia, noted that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine were more than twice as likely to be prescribed steroid medications.
""This is relevant considering the recent RECOVERY trial that showed a mortality benefit with [the steroid] dexamethasone among individuals requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation,"" the authors wrote, ""potentially biasing this study’s results in favor of hydroxychloroquine.""
The study also did not provide information about how patients fared at different time points, which could have influenced outcomes.
""As the Henry Ford Health System became more experienced in treating patients with COVID-19, survival may have improved, regardless of the use of specific therapies,"" the commentary said. 
Schluger also noticed that when the Henry Ford authors matched the hydroxychloroquine patients to those who did not receive the drug, the analysis included only a small fraction — 190 — of the more than 2,500 patients. 
""That to me seems quite unusual and really indicates that the patients just weren’t the same,"" Schluger said. When he used the technique in his observational study, he included 1,085 patients out of a total of 1,446.
But rather than comparing the observational studies, Schluger said the larger point is that there are randomized controlled trials now.
""The vast majority of evidence by now — I mean, really, an overwhelming amount of evidence — suggests that hydroxychloroquine has no effect,"" he said. ""And now we have randomized controlled trials, so in a sense the whole issue of observational studies is a little bit moot.""
Unsubstantiated Claim About Earlier Treatment
A central claim, both by Navarro, and the authors of the study, is that early treatment is a key reason why the results were positive for hydroxychloroquine this time, whereas in the past they have been negative.
""We attribute our findings that differ from other studies to early treatment, and part of a combination of interventions that were done in supportive care of patients, including careful cardiac monitoring,"" said Dr. Marcus Zervos, the division head of infectious disease for Henry Ford Health System, and a co-author of the study.
But other experts say there’s little to back that claim.
""I don’t believe that at all,"" said Boulware, ""because they don’t have data to support that."" The Henry Ford study, he said, specifically said that it did not catalog when patients’ symptoms began, making it impossible to know whether the hospital treated patients any sooner or not.
The health system did treat patients soon upon admission — 82% within a day, and 91% within two. But, as Boulware said, ""in the other studies they were also being treated early, so it wasn’t like that was unique.""
In Rosenberg’s observational study, which the Henry Ford paper explicitly cited in its discussion as having included patients who received hydroxychloroquine at any time during hospitalization, the median time to the first hydroxychloroquine dose was one day. (The Henry Ford authors also claimed mortality was ""significantly higher"" in this study, but the overall mortality was 20.3% — just a few percentage points above its own.)
""This idea that somehow these folks were treated earlier in Michigan,"" Rosenberg said, ""that’s not consistent with the data.""
In Schluger’s observational study, 46% were treated within 24 hours after arriving at the emergency room, and 86% were treated within 48 hours.
How the Henry Ford study compares with the large clinical trials is unknown, since those details have not yet been published. The NIH, however, told us that in its trial, patients needed to test positive for the coronavirus within the past 10 days to be eligible, and that patients were excluded if it had been more than 10 days from the beginning of any acute respiratory symptoms.
It’s possible that hydroxychloroquine does need to be given early to show any effect, Boulware said, even if the Henry Ford study cannot make that claim. 
But that answer best comes from a randomized controlled trial. Boulware said he was aware of nine randomized controlled trials testing hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 outpatients; two have results but are not yet published, while the others are struggling with enrollment. One from the NIH closed on June 20 when it had enrolled only 20 people.
Giving hydroxychloroquine very early — before or after exposure to the coronavirus, for prevention — is also still a possibility, although Boulware’s post-exposure study did not find the drug to be effective, and another unpublished trial also turned up negative.
Navarro can say hydroxychloroquine is still worth studying, but it’s misleading to classify the vast majority of evidence as positive, and to fail to mention several randomized controlled trials that found no benefit in hospitalized patients when playing up a study that was also conducted in hospitalized patients.
""It’s very interesting that of all the administration people, the only person that they can get to come out and promote hydroxychloroquine is not a physician,"" said Boulware. ""That should probably be a big red flag.""

A viral headline shared on social media falsely asserts that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed testing thresholds to ""virtually eliminate"" COVID-19 cases among vaccinated individuals. That’s wrong. The threshold in question simply applies to whether or not there is enough virus present in a sample for further analysis.

              What tests are available for COVID-19?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              Tests that detect current infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are known as viral tests. There are two types: a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test, or NAAT, and an antigen test. 
Many of the NAATs use a molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect even a very tiny amount of the virus in a specimen.
The PCR test takes advantage of some natural features of biology to essentially scan through all of the RNA present in a sample — such as a nasal swab — and search for the presence of coronavirus RNA. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says NAATs ""are unlikely to return a false-negative result of SARS-CoV-2,"" and it recommends only laboratory-based NAATS, the most sensitive tests, to confirm infection. It also says saliva tests aren’t as optimal as those using swabs of the nose or nasopharynx (upper throat behind the nose).
An antigen test is designed to detect the coronavirus antigen, a structure on the surface of the virus that triggers an immune response. Also conducted via a nasal or throat swab, antigen tests are less sensitive than NAATs but inexpensive and can usually produce results in about 15 minutes. Getting a result from a NAAT test can take about an hour or even a few days.
Testing can help stop the spread of the coronavirus from those who test positive, because they can then isolate themselves from others. But, as we’ve explained, testing has its limitations. It can take a few days or even longer after exposure to the virus before it’s detectable by the diagnostic tests. So even some with negative results could be infectious.
Still, to help limit the spread, the U.S. has instituted travel requirements and recommendations. All international airline passengers, including U.S. citizens and residents, and those who are fully vaccinated, arriving in the U.S. must show ""a negative COVID-19 test, taken within three (3) calendar days of departure​, or proof of recovery from the virus within the last 90 days,"" as the State Department explains.
The CDC also recommends that everyone, including the fully vaccinated, get a viral test three to five days after returning from international travel.
The CDC recommends that those who aren’t fully vaccinated avoid international travel, and if they must travel, to get a test one to three days beforehand. The unvaccinated also should self-quarantine for seven days after returning to the U.S., even if they tested negative before or upon returning.
International destinations may have their own testing requirements as well.
As for domestic travel, the fully vaccinated don’t need to get tested, but the CDC recommends the unvaccinated follow the same guidelines as those for international travel.

Full Story
As part of its efforts to track breakthrough COVID-19 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently offered public health departments and labs guidance for when to send the federal agency samples from such cases.
The agency defines breakthrough infections as those that occur when someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at least two weeks after they receive their final dose of a vaccine. Specimens from some of those cases are collected so that scientists can sequence the sample, which can identify specific variants of the virus.

A false claim spreading on social media distorts the facts on this issue, wrongly asserting that the CDC has changed COVID-19 testing procedures to no longer count cases among vaccinated people.
The website Zero Hedge — known for spreading misinformation — ran a May 23 story headlined, ""Caught Red-Handed: CDC Changes Test Thresholds To Virtually Eliminate New COVID Cases Among Vaxx’d."" It was shared on Facebook more than 13,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
The story was actually republished from a website called off-guardian.org, whose own post garnered more than 2,000 shares on Facebook.
But the claims made in the story rest on a misrepresentation of what the CDC said.
The piece begins by accusing the agency of ""altering its practices of data logging and testing for ‘Covid19’ in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy ‘vaccines’ are effective at preventing the alleged disease.""
First of all, as we’ve explained, experts say the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are not gene therapy. While some have made that claim about the mRNA vaccines — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — the vaccines do not modify a person’s genes. A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson also told us in a recent email that ""none of these vaccines are defined as a gene therapy.""
And the vaccines have proven to be highly effective in clinical trials — and, so far, in real-world use. For more, see our SciCheck stories on the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines.
The viral story focuses on polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests — which have been used to diagnose COVID-19 — and the issue of cycle threshold values. The piece dubiously purports that high cycle threshold values have been responsible for false-positive cases that have helped to cause ""an entirely created pandemic narrative.""
As we’ve outlined before, a PCR test works by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. The test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load — meaning more virus is present in the sample — will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles.
There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — ""although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint"" of a PCR run — Ian Mackay, a virologist in Australia, previously told us.
The central debate among scientists in regards to COVID-19 cases detected at high cycle threshold values (meaning less virus is present) isn’t whether they are false positives, but how to interpret and act on those cases. For example, a sample detected at a cycle threshold of 45 could mean the person already had COVID-19 and is no longer contagious; though, alternatively, it could also mean someone only recently became infected.
The viral story claims that ""NOW, and only for fully vaccinated people, the CDC will only accept samples achieved from 28 cycles or fewer. That can only be a deliberate decision in order to decrease the number of ‘breakthrough infections’ being officially recorded.""
That’s not what the CDC has said about a cycle threshold of 28.
Instead, the CDC said samples submitted for genetic sequencing would need to be at that threshold. Scientists use sequencing to decode the genes of the virus to better understand factors such as its spread and evolution.
On its informational page for public health departments and laboratories, the CDC provides instructions for submitting samples to the agency for breakthrough infection monitoring. There, the CDC says: ""For cases with a known RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, submit only specimens with Ct value ≤28 to CDC for sequencing. (Sequencing is not feasible with higher Ct values.)""
The threshold doesn’t pertain to deciding whether the test is positive or not.
""The CDC is still counting positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular results with any cycle threshold value as it pertains to case counts,"" Matthew Binnicker, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, told us in an email. ""However, for sequencing studies, laboratories need a certain amount of the virus’ RNA in a sample for the sequencing to be successful. In other words, if there is a low amount of the viral RNA present, the sequencing will not produce results that can be interpreted.""
CDC spokeswoman Jasmine Reed told us the same.
Reed said in an email that the ""Ct value ≤28 is not used to define whether a specimen is positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. The Ct value cutoff of 28 is only for submitting specimens that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 to CDC for sequencing.""
""Different labs will use different cutoffs for deciding when to perform sequencing. However, the Ct value needed to perform sequencing will not vary by vaccination status,"" she added. ""In general, CDC uses the same Ct value cutoff for submitting other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance specimens for sequencing. That cutoff is set because at Ct values >28 it becomes increasingly difficult to successfully sequence the specimen because the RNA levels in the specimens are generally too low.""
All Positive COVID-19 Cases Are Counted
The viral story goes on to wrongly say that ""being asymptomatic – or having only minor symptoms – will no longer count as a ‘Covid case'"" if the person is vaccinated, even if someone tests positive.

The story cites a CDC May 1 update that says the agency ""transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause.""
It’s true that the CDC has decided to no longer investigate and report on all breakthrough cases. Instead, it will actively investigate and report on hospitalized or fatal cases, Reed told us. The CDC developed a national database through which state health departments can enter and manage data for such cases.
""As of May 1, 2021 CDC has transitioned from public reporting of all vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and actively investigating hospitalized or fatal cases for clustering by patient demographics, geographic location, time since vaccination, vaccine type, and SARS-CoV-2 lineage,"" Reed said. ""Some health departments may continue to report all vaccine breakthrough cases; however, CDC will focus its public reporting on hospitalized and fatal cases.""
The CDC page on breakthrough infection reporting notes: ""Data on patients with vaccine breakthrough infection who were hospitalized or died will be updated regularly."" It adds that studies around the country are also being conducted on breakthrough infections, regardless of clinical status, ""to supplement the national surveillance.""
But the May 1 change does not mean that positive COVID-19 tests among vaccinated people will ""no longer be recorded"" as COVID-19 cases, as the story claims.
If someone tests positive for COVID-19, ""you are going to be recorded as a case, there is no way around it,"" Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer for population health at the University of Washington, told us in a phone interview. ""They didn’t change the rules.""
In other words, if someone who is vaccinated tests positive for COVID-19, that case will still be reported in standard COVID-19 case counts. Jade Fulce, another CDC spokeswoman, confirmed that ""breakthrough cases are captured in the regular case reporting system.""
That said, Mokdad — who previously worked at the CDC — is among some critics of the agency’s decision to focus only on breakthrough infections that result in hospitalizations or deaths.
By not more closely investigating all breakthrough infections, Mokdad argues, opportunities are missed to more closely understand trends in breakthrough infections — such as the role of specific variants, or whether the infections are occurring following a specific vaccine, in a certain time period or in certain demographics.
He argues that the CDC should conduct regular random sampling among vaccinated people — especially since most asymptomatic breakthrough infections will not be tested and identified — to observe how things change over time and in different populations.
The CDC in a May 25 report said there were 10,262 breakthrough infections reported between Jan. 1 and April 30. About 101 million people were fully vaccinated by April 30.
While that suggests such cases are rare, the agency acknowledged that ""the number of reported COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases is likely a substantial undercount of all SARS-CoV-2 infections among fully vaccinated persons."" That’s in part because the data may not be complete and because people with such infections, ""especially those who are asymptomatic or who experience mild illness, might not seek testing.""

The delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads more quickly than the original virus and has been classified as a ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization. It is now the dominant variant in the U.S. But a meme has been circulating on Facebook falsely claiming the delta variant is ""fake news.""

              How lethal is COVID-19?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              It’s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn’t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.
The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the United States as of July 9.
An individual’s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person’s age or health conditions. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is more than 600 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29.

Full Story
The delta variant of the coronavirus, which was first documented in India in October, is now the dominant variant in the U.S. It accounted for more than half of new infections for the two weeks ending July 3, according to the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Viruses change over time and, as they mutate, they produce variants, which can develop more dangerous attributes. Four variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been called ""notable"" by the CDC, which is monitoring their growth across the country. The delta variant is among them.
This variant of the virus spreads more quickly and easily than the original, and it has been designated as a ""variant of concern"" by both the World Health Organization and a U.S. government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group.
A variant that spreads more easily could lead to more cases of COVID-19, which could strain the health care system and, potentially, cause more deaths, according to the CDC.
""Where the delta variant is identified, it really rapidly takes off and spreads between people more efficiently than even the alpha variant,"" WHO epidemiologist Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove explained in a recent interview.
So far, the delta variant has been detected in 98 countries, according to the WHO.
But a meme has been circulating on Facebook suggesting that the variant isn’t real or isn’t serious. It says, ""The Delta Variant Is Fake News.""
That text is typed over a 2017 executive order that then-President Donald Trump signed to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. After signing it, Trump held up the order and a photo of that moment has been used to make a host of similar memes.
The meme has garnered comments indicating that many believe the mutations of the virus that causes COVID-19 are political fabrications, as shown in this example: ""They’re just getting us ready to lock us down again in 2022 so they can have a cheat fest again.""
But, as we said, the delta variant is a ""variant of concern"" and is now responsible for more than half of the new COVID-19 infections in the U.S.
It’s worth noting, too, that the currently available vaccines appear to be effective against the delta variant, but it’s important to get the full dosage of the vaccine if two shots are required, as is the case for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Also, the standard public health guidance that recommends physical distancing and wearing masks can help to control the spread of this variant.

		Quick Take
A meme circulating on Facebook falsely claims, ""Not one politician has died from the virus."" Actually, at least five current or former politicians across the country have died due to COVID-19.
Full Story
More than 189,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19, so far — including some national, state, and local politicians.
But a meme is spreading this falsehood: ""Not one politician has died from the virus, lost their job, or had their business looted.""
Dozens of copies of the meme — which shows actor Tommy Lee Jones reading a newspaper — have been circulating on Facebook since at least July. One early version that was shared 35,000 times features the name ""Mike Rilling,"" which is stamped on many right-wing memes shared from a Facebook account with that name. We wrote about another one that included a made-up quote attributed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2019.
When the meme started circulating in early July, two state representatives already had died. State Rep. Bob Glanzer, of South Dakota, died on April 3 and State Rep. Reggie Bagala, of Louisiana, died on April 9. Local politicians had died, too, including Michael Yun, a councilman in Jersey City, New Jersey, who died on April 6, and Marny Xiong, chairwoman of the board of education in St. Paul, Minnesota, who died on June 7.
Perhaps the most widely covered death of a politician came in late July, though, when former presidential candidate Herman Cain died from complications due to COVID-19 on July 30.
Also, at least one politician had his office looted. Rep. Brendan Boyle reported on June 1 that his district office in Philadelphia had been looted during protests that followed the death of George Floyd.
Despite easily accessed news stories that contradict the claim, the meme continues to circulate. On Sept. 4, Ben Swann — a purveyor of dubious claims and conspiracy theories that we’ve written about before — posted the meme on Facebook, with Rilling’s name removed. That version has garnered more than 3,500 shares.
But, as we said, it’s not true. Politicians have died during the pandemic, and many more have been diagnosed with the disease, including Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Bill Cassidy, and 14 U.S. representatives. The nonprofit, nonpartisan website Ballotpedia is keeping track of the deaths and diagnoses for public officials and politicians.

		SciCheck Digest
Federal officials authorized two mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 after they were determined to be safe and effective against symptomatic illness in clinical trials. But a Texas doctor, in a widely shared video, falsely claims the vaccines don’t provide protection and that they’re actually ""experimental gene therapy.""

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How do we know vaccines are safe?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

              Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever.
Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain and chills. These reactions are more likely after the second dose of those vaccines, given several weeks after the first, and are more common and severe in younger people. The Johnson & Johnson side effects, too, were more common in 18- to 59-year-old participants, and also included nausea.
As the CDC explains, these common side effects are normal signs that your body is beginning to mount an immune response and the symptoms should go away within several days. Some people have no side effects, and that is normal, too.
Rarely, the COVID-19 vaccines may cause more serious problems. This includes a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which has occurred in 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated, according to the CDC, and, for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a blood clotting disorder coupled with low levels of platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). As of July 12, that issue, which has almost entirely affected women below the age of 50, has been confirmed in 38 cases, after more than 12.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine.
The FDA also has warned of an observed increased risk of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome associated with the J&J vaccine. The warning came after preliminary reports of 100 cases including one reported death, but it isn’t known whether the death or the cases were caused by the vaccine.
Additionally, there is emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in young men.

Full Story
In a video shared widely on social media, a Texas doctor known for his political activism — and whose vitamin sales prompted a warning by federal officials — is peddling a host of false claims to try to discourage people from getting vaccinated against COVID-19.

Dr. Steven Hotze implores viewers to ""just say no"" to the vaccines, after a long, error-filled pitch that baselessly alleges that the mRNA vaccines aren’t actually vaccines at all. 
As we’ve explained in previous SciCheck stories, two vaccines currently approved in the U.S., from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, are designed using modified messenger RNA. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make spike proteins that then trigger an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. (See ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine."") 
Hotze is a conservative activist who unsuccessfully challenged COVID-19 public health measures in Texas last year and who made unproven allegations about voter fraud ahead of the 2020 election. In December, the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission sent Hotze a letter warning him to stop selling his line of vitamins by using misleading suggestions that they could treat or prevent COVID-19.
His video focusing on mRNA vaccines was published on his website Feb. 26. The link to that post has been shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data. The video has also been viewed tens of thousands of times across various posts on Facebook and Instagram.
We reached out to Hotze about some of his claims in the video and didn’t hear back. We’ll break down a few of his assertions here.
False Claims About Vaccine Efficacy, Definition
Hotze tells his viewers: ""If you are immune to a disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected. The so-called COVID-19 vaccine does not provide any individual who receives the vaccine with immunity to COVID-19, nor does it prevent the spread of the disease. It does not meet the CDC’s own definition of a vaccine. That’s why it’s a deceptive trade practice under 15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission for pharmaceutical companies who are producing this experimental gene therapy to claim that it’s a vaccine.""
The vaccines have demonstrated in clinical trials to be highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, as we’ve detailed. The Pfizer and Moderna trials enrolled more than 30,000 people each and found an efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease of at least 94% after the second dose. So his claim that the vaccines don’t ""provide any individual who receives the vaccine with immunity to COVID-19″ is wrong.
As we’ve explained before, it’s currently unclear how much the vaccines will limit transmission of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. In other words, while the vaccines were shown to prevent someone from developing symptoms of COVID-19, they may not prevent a person from carrying the virus. But there’s a good chance they will help curb transmission to some degree: Experts say with other vaccines, a vaccinated person, even if infected with the virus, often sheds less virus, therefore making them less contagious.
Hotze’s remark that mRNA vaccines don’t ""meet the CDC’s own definition of a vaccine"" also holds no weight.
He points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website defines a vaccine as a ""product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease."" That’s correct. But that definition is also consistent with the FDA’s decision to issue emergency use authorizations for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines because of their demonstrated efficacy in trials.
""Clearly, Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines are ‘product[s] that stimulate a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease,’ i.e., COVID-19, and they have a protective effect,"" Jacob Sherkow, a University of Illinois law professor whose research focuses in part on the legal implications of advanced biotechnologies, told us in an email. Sherkow noted that it’s not entirely clear what the legal effects of the CDC’s website definition are, since ""[i]t’s not a formal administrative rule or even a guidance … it’s just a generic definition of a vaccine.""
Hotze’s argument that the mRNA vaccines are a ""deceptive trade practice"" also doesn’t make sense. While he cites ""15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission,"" it appears he’s referring to 15 U.S. Code § 45 — since section 41 just deals with the establishment of the FTC.
""The only thing § 45 of the FTC Act does, here, is give FTC authority to police ‘deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,'"" Sherkow said. ""It doesn’t define what a deceptive act is.""
Sherkow said the definition of a ""deceptive practice"" rests on many years’ worth of case law: ""In general, those arise when three conditions are met: there is a representation or omission that misleads a consumer; the consumer’s interpretation is ‘reasonable’; and the misrepresentation is ‘material,’ i.e., the consumer purchased the product because of the representation.""
""None of those are present here,"" he added. ""There is no misrepresentation about the nature of these vaccines — indeed, there’s an ocean of information about exactly what they are and how they work.""

Erroneous ‘Gene Therapy’ Assertion
Again referencing the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, Hotze falsely claims: ""These so-called vaccines, which are manufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s, should more accurately be called experimental gene therapy. They are untested, unproven experimental gene therapy that poses a much greater danger and risk to your health than the COVID-19.""
We’ll first address his false assertion that the vaccines are an ""experimental gene therapy"" — an allegation he makes repeatedly throughout his video.
The FDA’s website defines gene therapy as a ""technique that modifies a person’s genes to treat or cure disease.""
Sherkow, who has written about gene therapy, said the mRNA vaccines don’t qualify as such.
""The mRNA vaccines do not modify a person’s genes, i.e., their genome,"" he said. ""They’re transcripts of the virus’s Spike gene that get translated into protein and expressed in cells; the mRNA degrades afterwards. The genome remains unchanged.""
Likewise, the co-directors of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development recently explained why the ""gene therapy"" claims are inaccurate, in a piece addressing vaccine myths for the Washington Post.
""[T]he mRNA delivered through lipid nanoparticles in a vaccine does not enter our genome. It becomes a template for cells to make compounds of amino acids on molecules called ribosomes in the cytoplasm compartment of the cell, outside the nucleus (where the DNA resides),"" Dr. Peter Hotez and Maria Elena Bottazzi wrote. ""Our immune system then responds to the new peptide, which resembles the spike protein on the coronavirus. Therefore, it’s not correct to say that the mRNA vaccines are equivalent to ‘gene therapy,’ as some critics of the vaccines have claimed.""
And Hotze’s claim that the mRNA vaccines are ""manufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s"" is wrong, too.
As we’ve explained before, fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines — such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A. But those cells aren’t present in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe.
The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, however, aren’t made from a virus and are not manufactured using those fetal cell lines, as Hotze claims. That said, one of the cell lines was used to test those two mRNA vaccines to ensure they worked.
A third vaccine approved in the U.S. — a single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson that does not use the mRNA platform — is made by using an adenovirus that is produced using a retinal cell line that was first obtained from a fetus in 1985, according to the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Like other vaccines manufactured using the cell lines, fetal cells are not actually present in the J&J COVID-19 vaccine.
Distortion Behind Claim of Danger
Hotze distorts the facts in attempting to claim that the mRNA vaccines are dangerous.
He claims that the vaccines will cause your immune system to ""be hyper-charged because it’s having to fight off all these viral proteins that your own body is making all the time, and it will overreact when exposed to any type of coronavirus in the future."" He goes on to say that, in previous studies dealing with coronaviruses, ""the animals died from an immune system hyper reaction, when they were later exposed to the coronavirus against which they had been previously vaccinated.""
There is no evidence that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines result in such an immune response.
Hotze’s website post of the video references a commentary article from October, before any COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA, in which two researchers warned about the possibility that COVID-19 vaccine candidates could cause antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, or ADE. ADE is a phenomenon that occurs when a previous infection or vaccination generates antibodies that don’t neutralize the virus but instead enhance the virus’ ability to infect cells, which can lead to a worse illness instead of preventing it.
But the animal studies cited in the commentary piece didn’t deal with mRNA vaccines, as Hotze suggests. One 2012 study that’s referenced found that vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV (the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003) caused mice to develop eosinophilia — a high count of a type of white blood cells — when exposed to the live virus. The animals didn’t die, as our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters have explained.
Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who researches vaccines at the Center for Immunization Research, told us in an email that the issue of ADE in relation to SARS-CoV vaccine candidates dealt with inactivated vaccines — not mRNA vaccines. She said the specific immune response issue observed with those vaccine candidates has not been observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines being used in the U.S.
""We have not seen any cases of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 disease, either in animal models or in vaccinated humans,"" she added.
Other experts also have explained that there is no evidence indicating ADE is an issue with the COVID-19 vaccines.
Derek Lowe, a medicinal chemist, explored the issue in February on his blog on the website of the journal Science Translational Medicine and explained that animal studies are specifically designed to look for signs of ADE. He said the research into SARS-CoV vaccines provided helpful lessons for developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. (A vaccine for SARS was never approved, as the outbreak ended and there are no known human cases of the disease.)
""So here’s the short version: no sign of ADE during the preclinical animal studies. No sign during the human clinical trials. No sign during the initial vaccine rollouts into the population,"" he concluded. ""And (so far) no sign of ADE even with the variant strains in different parts of the world. We have things to worry about in this pandemic, but as far as I can tell today, antibody-dependent enhancement does not seem to be one of them.""

		In the wake of an increasing number of new coronavirus infections in the U.S., federal officials have provided confusing and sometimes contradictory statements about the number and availability of tests to diagnose the new respiratory illness.
President Donald Trump claimed on March 6 that anyone who ""wants a test can get a test,"" while Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a television interview the same day that there ""is no testing kit shortage, nor has there ever been.""
Contrary to both men, we were told by the Association of Public Health Laboratories on March 9 that although things had improved since a week ago, ""demand for testing is greater than the tests available.""
At the same time, at least one Democrat has exaggerated the problems. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden said on March 1 that the Trump administration didn’t ""even have a test kit"" for the new coronavirus. That’s not true. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is widely viewed to have bungled the rollout of its viral test kits, there was a test kit at the time, and it had been successfully used by the agency and some states.
The novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the pneumonia-like illness called COVID-19, which first appeared in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.
We’ll explain how testing works, what happened with the CDC’s coronavirus test and what’s known about how many tests are available in the U.S.
How does a coronavirus test work?
Most of the available diagnostics are molecular tests that use a standard molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect even a very tiny amount of the virus in a specimen.
The test takes advantage of some natural features of biology to essentially scan through all of the RNA present in a sample — such as a nose or throat swab, or some phlegm — and search for the presence of coronavirus RNA. The scanning happens with test components known as primers and probes, which are sequence-based, and therefore can be made specific to the virus. 
In those reactions, if the novel coronavirus is present in the sample, then a short snippet of DNA is copied many times over, which can be read out on a machine. If there is no virus — or if there’s a different virus, such as influenza — then no DNA fragment is made and there’s no signal to detect.
The CDC’s test was designed to use three main sets of primers and probes — two that match just the novel coronavirus, and one that matches a variety of highly similar viruses. Someone infected with COVID-19 should test positive for all three, while someone who’s not infected should be negative for all three. A person who has SARS would only test positive using the third primer and probe set, thereby offering a way to theoretically discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and other similar viruses. That concern, however, is hypothetical in this case, since there isn’t a known outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Eventually, the CDC will have a different so-called serology test that looks for whether a person developed antibodies in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The test, which does not need to be done when someone is actively infected, can yield a positive result whether or not someone developed symptoms. It therefore may provide answers about how many COVID-19 infections there were and how deadly the virus is in the larger population.
What went wrong with the CDC’s test kits?
Early on, all COVID-19 testing was done at the CDC with its own kit, and it performed well. The kit was successfully used to diagnose the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. on Jan. 20 in a patient returning from Wuhan to Washington state. A CDC report also notes that between Jan. 18 and Feb. 23, the agency tested 2,620 specimens from just over 1,000 people.
Problems arose after Feb. 5, when the CDC began shipping its kits out to qualified state and local public health labs in an effort to expand testing. Initially, the agency said it was releasing 200 kits — each capable of testing around 700 to 800 specimens — giving labs just one kit each. But by Feb. 12, the CDC told reporters that some labs had been experiencing issues when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked.
The CDC has not clarified exactly what the issue was, but has said that there was a manufacturing problem related to the third test component, which led to ""inconclusive"" results. The Association of Public Health Laboratories told us more specifically that a negative control, which should not have reacted to any of the primer and probe sets, was coming back positive for the third set, which was the test for all SARS-like coronaviruses.
For a while, the agency promised to re-manufacture the faulty third component and distribute that to the public health labs and, in the meantime, asked any lab that had difficulties to send samples into the CDC for testing. As a result, as of Feb. 25, only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing.
More than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC said it had come up with a fix — labs could proceed without the third test, and just use the two other primer and probe sets to make accurate diagnoses. The agency also said that it had manufactured new tests with just the two components, omitting the third.
What other factors limited testing?
Other than the lack of CDC test kits, several other circumstances prevented wider scale testing early in the outbreak. 
One was the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested for the virus. At first, the CDC recommended testing only for those who had a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and had traveled to Wuhan or had contact with a suspected or confirmed coronavirus case.
In late February, after a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC guidelines were relaxed to include anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. Then, on March 3, Vice President Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test. 
The CDC updated its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians ""should use their judgment"" in deciding who should be tested, keeping in mind the local epidemiology and COVID-19 symptoms — and strongly encouraging testing for other respiratory infections, such as influenza.
Another issue had to do with who could do COVID-19 testing. 
Academic labs and other similar facilities that had the expertise to develop tests were advised not to use their own tests for diagnosing patients until they sought permission from the Food and Drug Administration. As we’ve explained before, this is not a law but has been a de facto FDA policy. On Feb. 29, the FDA announced that validated in-house tests could be used for diagnosis immediately, as long as the agency received applications for the emergency use of the tests within 15 business days.
How problematic was the delay?
It’s not yet clear exactly what the delays meant for the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. But some experts say the lack of testing in many of the nation’s public health labs hampered early detection. 
The CDC reported the first case of possible community spread on Feb. 26, and the first reported death, in a Seattle suburb, followed three days later. It would later turn out that two COVID-19-related deaths happened as early as Feb. 26. A genetic analysis of some of the first cases in Washington state also suggested that the virus had been circulating undetected since mid-January. The state did not begin its own testing until Feb. 28.
Scott Lindquist, an epidemiologist with the Washington Department of Health, told the Seattle Times that problems with the CDC’s test kit ""really did set us back, there’s no denying that.""
In a CDC telebriefing announcing the first U.S. death, Jeffrey Duchin, a University of Washington epidemiologist and health officer for Public Health Seattle and King County, noted that the patient who died had been tested locally, but only because the lab had just received kits and because of ""very recent"" changes in CDC criteria for testing. ""If we had the ability to test earlier,"" he said, ""I’m sure we would have identified patients earlier in the community.""
With more available tests and less stringent clinical criteria for testing, the U.S. could have set up a more proactive system for detecting coronavirus cases, although it’s possible the outcome would still be the same. 
The CDC, in fact, wanted to set up a five- or six-site surveillance network in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City, which would begin testing for COVID-19 in people with flu-like symptoms who test negative for influenza. The plan was to then scale up the network to each state. But with the test kit difficulties, that schedule was set back. On Feb. 28, the CDC said that it expected to have the first of six sites up and running by the following week. When we asked on March 10, the agency did not have an immediate update on the program.
How many tests are available?
Throughout last week, officials gave confusing and conflicting answers about how many tests would be available — and when — in various appearances.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Azar said on March 1 that ""we now have the ability to test 75,000 people in the field at this moment,"" but later said that those tests would be shipped by the end of the week.
Vice President Mike Pence also at times referred to test kits, when he meant the number of people who could be tested, and said on March 4, ""We’ll have over a million tests in the field today,"" a statement that conflicted with other administration estimates of 1 million tests shipping out by the end of the week.
Part of the confusion has to do with the fact that testing is happening at several different levels — by the CDC, by state and local public health labs, and at hospitals and other facilities — and that the words used to describe the testing aren’t always consistent.
A test ""kit"" means an entire box of supplies to run tests to diagnose many people. A CDC test kit, for example, is able to test 700 to 800 specimens. Other test kits come with enough reagents for 500 ""reactions."" Because controls need to be run, fewer than 500 samples can be tested with such a kit. And in both cases, the actual number of people who could be diagnosed with each will be lower, since patients may have multiple samples or samples may be run in duplicate. The same issue applies to the word ""test.""
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn provided the clearest answer about testing capacity on March 7, when he said that the CDC had shipped enough kits to state and local public health labs to test 75,000 people for COVID-19. 
In addition, more than 1.1 million tests manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies had been shipped as of March 6 for non-public health labs to use, with another 400,000 possibly shipping by March 9. A separate manufacturer had also produced 640,000 tests that could have shipped as early as March 9, once quality control testing was complete.
""The actual number of tests that have shipped is larger than the number of patients that can be tested,"" Hahn explained, noting that the approximately 2.1 million tests from IDT and another company would allow roughly 850,000 Americans to be tested.
On top of those tests, he added, would be any testing by commercial or academic labs, plus an expected additional 4 million tests from IDT and the other company by the end of this week. The CDC itself also can test approximately 350 specimens per day.
In a March 9 telebriefing, the CDC’s Nancy Messonnier clarified that the 75,000 people that can be tested using the CDC’s test kit in public health labs is a cumulative figure. She also said that in the coming weeks, as more manufacturers join the effort, the ""majority"" of testing will be from the commercial sector.
Several commercial companies have stepped forward to increase production. Quest Diagnostics said it could begin testing on March 9, and LabCorp said its test was available for ordering on March 5, with results taking three to four days once a specimen is received in the mail. 
Can ""anybody that wants a test"" get one, as the president said?
Not quite. On a March 6 visit to the CDC, Trump said, ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test,"" adding, ""Anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test. We — they’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.""
When we asked the White House about this, the vice president’s office told us that tests were available through state labs, but that doctors needed to contact the state lab to get one. In other words, if someone wants a test, and a physician does not agree, a person cannot be tested.
This point was also made by Anthony Fauci, the director of the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" when he said tests ""are out there now,"" but ""it’s up to the doctor to order the test.""
It’s worth mentioning that even if a test has been shipped, it hasn’t necessarily been received or is ready to use right away; tests also take some time to complete, and so results may not be available immediately.
The CDC maintains that no person was ever denied a coronavirus test, nor was there ever a backlog at the agency. ""Our guidance for who can be tested has always allowed room for clinical discretion,"" said CDC press officer Richard Quartarone in an email. ""That is, if a doctor had a patient who they wanted tested, CDC has not refused any of these requests."" The only exception to that, Quartarone told us, might be a damaged sample.
Some groups, however, dispute the idea that tests are fully available or that there has never been a shortage.
""We are now in the phase of the response where demand for testing is greater than the tests available, even when the private/commercial sector is doing testing,"" Eric Blank, the chief program officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told us in a March 9 email. ""So there is a test shortage but it is probably not as great as it was a week or so ago.""

		Quick Take
Viral social media posts falsely claim that no one has died at home from COVID-19, implying that poor medical care contributed to the deaths or that the disease is a hoax. Nearly 10,000 coronavirus victims have died in their homes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Full Story
As the United States reached a grim milestone of 200,000 deaths from COVID-19, recent social media posts falsely claim that no one has died from the novel coronavirus in their homes — implying that poor medical care contributed to their deaths or that the pandemic isn’t real.
""Not a single person with corona virus has been found dead in their home; every death has occurred at a hospital …"" reads one of the posts. Some comments on the post speculated that victims were ""murdered in hospitals or nursing homes,"" while others claimed the pandemic is a hoax.
But contrary to the post’s claim, nearly 10,000 people have died in their home due to COVID-19 as of Sept. 12, according to the provisional death count from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Cities hit hard by the novel coronavirus also saw an uptick in home deaths. In Houston, officials saw a spike in people dying at home with ""an increasing number"" of deaths coming from COVID-19, according to a ProPublica and NBC News report from July.
Authorities in New York City saw a similar trend early on in the pandemic when 200 people were dying at home each day in the city in early April, according to Gothamist and WNYC. Prior to the pandemic, there were 20 to 25 at-home deaths per day in the city, the report said.
Although some commented on the false Facebook post that victims were ""murdered"" in hospitals, the mortality rate in intensive care units has fallen over the course of the pandemic. Improvements in care have come as doctors have gained more experience in treating the disease, Dr. Craig Coopersmith, director of Emory Critical Care Center in Georgia, told NPR.
""There’s certainly nothing routine about the pandemic,"" Coopersmith said, ""but in terms of how we’re managing it, once you have taken care of something for the tenth time, it is normal.""
Along with experience, Coopersmith told NPR studies showing the benefit of steroids for sick patients has improved COVID-19 patients’ chances of surviving a trip to the ICU.
A commenter claimed that hospitals are being paid $39,000 for each COVID-19 death and that they’re ""killing them for money."" But FactCheck.org reported in April that while legislation pays hospitals higher Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients and treatment, there’s no evidence of fraudulent case reporting.

		In this video, we review several false and misleading claims that President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden made at the final presidential debate on Oct. 22. 

Here are the claims that we cover in the video:

Trump accused Biden of receiving ""$3.5 million from Russia."" There’s no evidence of that.
Biden claimed Social Security’s chief actuary said if Trump ""continues his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security"" the program ""will be bankrupt by 2023."" Trump hasn’t proposed ending the tax without providing alternative funding, the scenario the actuary assessed.
Trump misleadingly suggested the Obama administration was to blame for his administration’s policy that caused the separation of immigrant families.
Biden wrongly said ""the president’s own advisers have told him"" that the use of face masks can save an estimated 100,000 U.S. lives over the remainder of this year. That estimate, which has since been revised down to 34,000, came from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — not the administration.
The president falsely claimed that ""less than 1%"" of those caught crossing the border and released pending immigration hearings appear in court. The rate is about 50%, according to his own Justice Department. Immigration experts say it is even higher than that. 
Trump also falsely claimed murderers and rapists are released under a so-called ""catch and release"" policy. In fact, immigration laws require such criminals be detained.
Biden misleadingly claimed that ""38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison"" during the Obama administration. The total number went down by about 12,000.

		Quick Take
Pennsylvania voters told to quarantine due to potential COVID-19 exposure are entitled to vote and can request and return an emergency absentee ballot through 8 p.m. on Election Day. A viral Facebook post misleadingly suggests they are being disenfranchised.

Full Story
A viral claim pushed on Facebook the day before the 2020 election misleadingly suggests that voters in Pennsylvania are being prevented from voting by the state Department of Health and threatened with arrest if they do.
Spread by a popular conservative radio host in western Pennsylvania, the Facebook post asserts that ""[a]fter a reported ‘uptick’ in Covid positive cases, thousands of Pennsylvania voters in York, Lebanon, and Dauphin counties have been receiving letters from the state health department demanding that they quarantine for 14 days.""
""The letter states that they’ve been exposed to Covid-19 (no proof given) and, as such, must remain quarantined and not vote in person on election day,"" the post continues. ""If they fail to obey the order, they face possible arrest.""
It asks whether Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s ""administration is attempting to silence voters — hours before the most important election in American history?""
The post is misleading for a few reasons:

The letters are not a new form of communication in response to recently rising COVID-19 cases in the state; the state has been using the letters for months — and not only in those counties. The letters make no mention of the election.
If someone in the state had planned to vote in person and is now under quarantine, they can still request and return an emergency absentee ballot until 8 p.m. on Election Day. That option is included on the state’s website regarding voting.
A state Department of Health spokeswoman said those who receive such letters are first contacted by case managers (if they’ve tested positive) or contact tracers (if they’ve been in contact with someone who is positive), who were instructed to provide information about voting options.
State health officials do not provide the names of those ordered to quarantine to state or local election officials, so no one would be stopped from casting a ballot in person.

Radio host Wendy Bell, who published the claim on Facebook, attributed the information in a subsequent live-stream video to a writer named Todd Bartley, whose story on a website called talkwilliamsport.com told of a ""possible DOH voter suppression effort in Pennsylvania.""
That story focused on the purported script used by contact tracers in the state and included a copy of the state’s quarantine letter instructing individuals who had close contact with someone with COVID-19 to quarantine. It makes no mention of the election or voting, as we said.
While the story suggests the letter included was ""obtained"" and revelatory, the same exact copy — dated July and featuring the same redactions and highlighted section — was published by another reporter in August.
The letter instructs those who have been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days. Near the end of the letter, the state Department of Health says: ""If you do not cooperate with this directive, the Secretary of Health may petition a court to have you confined to an appropriate place chosen by the Department to make certain that you are not able to infect the public, and to make certain that you receive proper care.""
It continues by saying that ""[l]aw enforcement may be called upon, to the extent necessary, to ensure your compliance with this directive.""
April Hutcheson, a health department spokeswoman, told us in a phone interview that the ""quarantine letters have not changed since we started issuing them"" at the start of the pandemic and ""states what our authority is under the law."" They don’t make any references to voting or the election.
""We have not used that authority since the start of the pandemic,"" she said. ""There has been no one prosecuted in Pennsylvania [for violating quarantine]. If you’ve been contacted and been asked to quarantine, folks do the right thing and quarantine.""
Moreover, she said, no one receives the quarantine letter without first being contacted by a case manager or contact tracers, who were instructed to advise positive COVID-19 patients and close contacts on their voting options — including the option to contact their county elections officials to apply for an emergency absentee ballot, she said.
The website of the Department of State, which oversees the election process, says: ""In emergency situations (such as an unexpected illness or disability and last-minute absence) … you can request an Emergency Absentee Ballot."" The ballot needs to be returned by 8 p.m. on Election Day.
State officials also outlined this option for quarantined individuals in an Oct. 28 Erie News Now report, and in a Nov. 2 press release.
""Every Pennsylvanian who is registered to vote will have the opportunity to do so,"" Pennsylvania’s Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said in the press release, which was published following the viral claim’s spread. ""There’s an emergency ballot provision under the law. If you can’t deliver your own balloting materials you can assign a designee to do that for you. And if you can’t find a designee, the law actually requires the county election office to have a Sheriff’s Deputy or some county official to deliver the balloting materials for the voter.""
Hutcheson also said the state would not prevent voters from casting a ballot in person — or arrest them, for that matter — if they showed up to do so despite quarantine directives. Health officials do not provide state and local elections officials with records that would enable them to identify people directed to quarantine, she said.
""If you were to show up at a polling place, no one would be able to stop you,"" she said. ""It is your right to go vote, but we would prefer if you tested positive … that you would get an absentee ballot.""
She likened voting to other essential tasks, such as leaving home to get groceries.
The state has reported more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases and nearly 9,000 deaths during the pandemic.

		Quick Take
Online posts falsely claim that the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts donated $5 million to Democrats after it was allocated $25 million in the COVID-19 stimulus package. The center has not given any political contributions; it’s prohibited by law.

Full Story
The stimulus package that passed with bipartisan support in March to ease COVID-19’s crippling effect on the economy included $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
Shortly after that bill — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — became law, rumors started circulating online that the Washington D.C.-based arts center had given a $5 million contribution to Democrats.
One popular version of the rumor started on Twitter and later migrated to Facebook as a screenshot meme, framing the bogus claim this way:

Like a lot of misinformation that gets traction online, this tweet surrounded the falsehood with facts.
It’s true that the Kennedy Center finished a $250 million expansion in 2019 and that it got $41 million in federal funding for fiscal year 2019. That was the center’s annual  appropriation for operations, maintenance and repairs, which it gets since it serves as a memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Most of the center’s budget comes from its programming income and philanthropic donations, as well as some other sources, such as gift shop sales. Those brought in a combined $216 million in fiscal year 2019.
It’s also true, as we said, that the Kennedy Center has been allotted $25 million in the stimulus package. That money is ""to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally,"" according to the law, which specifies ""deep cleaning"" and ""information technology to improve telework capability"" as uses for the funds.
President Donald Trump, who signed the act on March 27, defended the inclusion of the Kennedy Center in the stimulus package at a press briefing a few days before that, saying, ""[T]hey’ve been essentially closed.  They have tremendous deficits that are built up. I mean, this thing has been devastating to it.""
But the primary claim made in the tweet is not true. The Kennedy Center didn’t give $5 million to the Democratic National Committee, nor is it true that it ""launders taxpayer money for the Democrats.""
The Kennedy Center is registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the Internal Revenue Service and, according to the IRS, those tax-exempt charitable organizations are barred from making political contributions.
Just to be sure, we searched the Federal Election Commission database for political contributions and found no record for political spending of any kind from the Kennedy Center going back as far as online records are available, which is 1980.
Employees of the center are, of course, eligible to make political donations. But any such individual contributions would come from their own money, not the center’s funds.
The writer of the original tweet, conservative content creator Cari Kelemen, later added a clarification that said: ""[M]y original tweet should have said: *Tomorrow* donates $5 M to the DNC. It was meant as a next-step hypothetical.""
But that hasn’t stopped others from taking the original claim and repeating it in new posts.

		Quick Take
As Florida’s COVID-19 case count rose to the second-highest in the U.S. in July, a former challenger for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s congressional seat falsely claimed on social media that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had made a ""mistake"" and subsequently reduced Florida’s count by 79,000 cases. There was no such adjustment.

Full Story
Florida has become a focal point in the nation’s struggles to contain the spread of COVID-19. More than 460,000 people have tested positive for infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in that state, including over 6,500 who have died, according to the Florida Department of Health. The state has surpassed New York and is now second only to California in total number of COVID-19 cases.
While the cases started rising dramatically in Florida and other states by mid-summer, the Trump administration ordered hospitals to bypass the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and send all COVID-19 patient information to the Department of Health and Human Services beginning on July 15. The procedural change concerned health experts who fear the data will be politicized or withheld from the public, the New York Times reported.
The following week, DeAnna Lorraine, who unsuccessfully tried to unseat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in California’s 12th Congressional District, referred to the change in hospital reporting procedures to falsely claim on social media that officials had been drastically over-counting Florida’s case numbers.
Lorraine, who describes herself as a ""recent Republican"" and conservative ""firebrand,"" tweeted on July 21, ""So now that Trump has said hospitals need to report numbers to WH instead of the CDC, the CDC just came out & said they made another ‘mistake’ in FL; And they’ve also been counting Pneumonia & Flu as Covid– dropping their # from approx 90,000 to 11,000. So many ‘mistakes,’ huh?""
The post has had nearly 30,000 retweets and was shared across social media platforms.
But Lorraine’s claims have been dismissed by the CDC, and she has not provided any evidence to support them.
On July 21, Lorraine tweeted about specific cases she claimed were misclassified, which included a motorcyclist who was killed in Florida and listed as a COVID-19 death. The person was later taken off of the state’s list of coronavirus deaths, according to Fox 35. 
Lorraine said in an email to FactCheck.org that she has evidence to support her claims and would send it to us. But she has not provided that information and didn’t respond to a follow-up inquiry.
Robert Anderson, the CDC’s chief of mortality statistics, told FactCheck.org in an email that the claims in Lorraine’s tweets are a rehash of other conspiracies that started in June.
""I’m not even sure where those numbers come from,"" Anderson said. ""They seem to have been pulled out of thin air.""
Anderson added: ""We certainly do not count pneumonia and flu deaths as COVID19 deaths, unless COVID19 is also mentioned. It’s not unusual to see the cause of death stated as pneumonia due to COVID19.""
CDC spokesman Scott Pauley also told FactCheck.org in an email that the ""CDC did not reduce the case counts in Florida.""
The reporting change Lorraine highlighted in her post, as we noted, referenced a recent change in how hospitals report COVID-19 information. Hospitals are asked to report bed capacity, utilization, personal protective equipment and in-house laboratory testing data to either their state health departments or directly to DHHS, rather than the CDC.
Anderson said that change does not affect mortality data, which still goes directly to the CDC.

		President Donald Trump, at a July 28 briefing, made a few false and misleading statements about COVID-19:

Trump falsely said that ""large portions"" of the country are ""corona-free."" Only 230 counties or county equivalents, accounting for less than 0.5% of the population, have not reported a coronavirus case in the past week.
The president claimed, without evidence, that Portland and Seattle were seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases because of protests. The health departments for both areas told us that the available data do not show that protests are responsible for an uptick in cases.
Trump said he didn’t know Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position on hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug that the president has claimed, contrary to scientific evidence, is effective against COVID-19. In fact, Fauci has said — at briefings attended by Trump — that there is no evidence that hydroxychloroquine works for COVID-19.

‘Large Portions’ of U.S. Not ‘Corona-Free’
In putting a positive spin on the current coronavirus situation, Trump inaccurately suggested that large parts of the U.S. no longer have any transmission of the coronavirus.
Trump, July 28: We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country; it’s — it’s corona-free. But we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida. It’s starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you’ll see it rapidly head down very soon. But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and, for the most part, most of Florida, it’s starting to head down.
The president is correct that some hotspots are improving. As of July 29, Arizona, California, Texas and Florida all show a downward trend in cases, according to an analysis by Johns Hopkins University.
But the notion that ""large portions"" of the U.S. are rid of the virus is false. We asked the White House where the coronavirus-free areas were, and did not receive a response.
Using county-level data from USAFacts, a not-for-profit that supplies data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we found that only 230 of the nation’s 3,142 counties or county equivalents have not reported a single coronavirus case for the week ending on July 28, the most recent day with data.
These counties are concentrated in the sparsely populated West, including numerous counties or their equivalents in Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas. Collectively, the 230 counties or county equivalents account for 0.42% of the total U.S. population.
The most populous county not to report a coronavirus case in the past week is Newport County, Rhode Island, which is home to around 82,000 residents.
A coronavirus task force report from July 26 also underscores how far the U.S. is from being coronavirus-free. Only one state — Vermont — is listed as being in the ""green zone"" for coronavirus cases, with 10 or fewer per 100,000 people in the last week. 
The rest of the nation is either in the ""yellow zone"" or ""red zone,""’ with between 10 and 100 cases per 100,000 people, or more than 100 cases per 100,000 people, respectively. Since the last public report from July 14, the number of ""red zone"" states for cases has increased, from 18 to 21.
As of July 29, the U.S. is posting a seven-day average of just over 64,000 new coronavirus cases per day, according to the COVID-19 Tracking Project.
No Evidence Protests Have Triggered Rise in COVID-19 Cases
Just after emphasizing the improvements in hotspots, Trump said that protests in certain cities were responsible for an increase in coronavirus cases.
""In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle,"" he said, ""we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what’s been going on.""
Both cities have observed a recent rise in cases, but health department officials told us there was no indication that it was due to protests.
""The available data does not support the assertion that protests in Seattle are driving our recent increase in cases,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer for public health for Seattle and King County, in an email to FactCheck.org. ""Although we recognize that COVID-19 transmission at large outdoor gatherings is possible and advise people to avoid such gatherings and take precautions if they participate, our investigations and data from our testing sites have found relatively small numbers of cases associated with these events.""
Duchin said that of the approximately 5,000 people who said they attended a protest event and were tested at a city-sponsored testing site, only 0.2% were positive for COVID-19. Further, Duchin said that case investigations were finding that a majority of the recent cases could be tied to a general increase in activity in the community, ""particularly family and social gatherings, household exposures and workplace transmissions.""
Multnomah County Public Health Director Rachael Banks told us much the same was true in Portland.
""We’re seeing an increase in cases, but there’s no evidence that the increase is due to residents who are protesting,"" she said in a phone interview, adding that every county resident who tests positive for COVID-19 is interviewed, and that since June 1, the department hasn’t identified any clusters associated with protests.
Since June 1, Banks said only 19 of the county’s more than 2,000 cases have reported attending a mass gathering such as a protest — or less than 1%. Instead, she said, case clusters have been linked to work site exposures, including food production plants, and to households and social networks.
Banks also questioned why her city was being highlighted by the president, as many other counties have worse outbreaks, including Orange County, California, and Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, Arizona.
Trump has previously tried to blame Black Lives Matter protests for spreading the coronavirus. But as we have written, despite initial fears that that might be the case, there isn’t evidence that it has happened.
Hydroxychloroquine
Trump also stated that he didn’t know Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position on hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug Trump has volubly supported, without evidence, as a powerful weapon against COVID-19.
Trump was at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on March 20 when Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there was no evidence that hydroxychloroquine was effective against COVID-19. And at another briefing on April 6, Trump cut off Fauci, a member of the task force, when he was asked about the drug, saying Fauci had answered the question ""15 times.""
At the July 28 press briefing, there was this exchange:
Reporter, July 28: On that note, Mr. President, last night, in tweets that were deleted by Twitter, you said that Dr. Fauci misled the country about hydroxychloroquine. How so?
Trump: No, not at all. I think — I don’t even know what his stance is on it.
Fauci has long been known as a skeptic on the merits of using hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19. He made that clear at the March 20 briefing attended by Trump.
Reporter, March 20: And to Dr. Fauci, if I could. Dr. Fauci — this was explained yesterday — there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?
Fauci: No. The answer is no. And the evidence that you’re talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. So as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we’re trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it’s truly safe and truly effective.
But the information that you’re referring to specifically is anecdotal; it was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.
At that briefing, Fauci also challenged the notion that hydroxychloroquine had proven valuable in treating SARS.
Reporter: It was also fairly effective against SARS.
Trump: It was a very — it was, as I understand that. Is that a correct statement — it was fairly effective on SARS?
Fauci: John, you’ve got to be careful when you say ""fairly effective."" It was never done in a clinical trial.
At the April 6 briefing, Trump made clear that he had heard more than enough about Fauci’s views on hydroxychloroquine.
Reporter, April 6: And would you also weigh in on this issue of hydroxychloroquine? What do you think about this? And what is the — what is the medical evidence?
Trump: Do you know how many times you’ve answered that question?
Fauci: Yeah —
Reporter: But I’d love to hear from the doctor.
Trump: Maybe 15. Fifteen times. You don’t have to ask the question.
Reporter: He’s — he’s your medical expert, correct?
Trump: He’s answered that question 15 times.
Fauci reiterated this week that the scientific evidence doesn’t support using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. In a July 28 interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s ""Good Morning America,"" Fauci said, ""The overwhelming, prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.""
Despite the lack of scientific support, Trump has long touted hydroxychloroquine as a promising option in combating COVID-19, calling it a potential ""game changer."" He said in May that he himself took the drug as a preventive measure.
We have written previously on a number of occasions about Trump’s enthusiasm for the drug and the lack of evidence of its efficacy. (See ""Trump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim,"" ""Trump Gets Ahead of Himself on COVID-19 Therapies,"" ""Trump Misleads on Hydroxychloriquine, Again."") Yet Trump’s support for the drug is undiminished.
The president again said at the July 28 briefing, ""I happen to believe in it.""
""Many doctors think it is extremely successful — the hydroxychloroquine — coupled with the zinc and perhaps the azithromycin,"" Trump said. ""But many doctors think it’s extremely good, and some people don’t. Some people — I think it’s become very political.""
As we have written, on July 27 Trump retweeted a widely shared video featuring a doctor falsely claiming hydroxychloroquine is a ""cure"" for COVID-19. The video has been taken down by Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. This was one of a series of retweets by Trump of tweets supporting the drug.
Numerous studies have cast serious doubt on its effectiveness when it comes to treating COVID-19.
""There are no data from randomized clinical trials that demonstrate effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for COVID,"" Dr. Neil Schluger, chairman of the department of medicine at New York Medical College School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. Schluger has studied hydroxychloroquine in relation to COVID-19. ""There are now several randomized clinical trials that show that it had no effect.""
""The vast majority of expert opinions … is that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit in COVID illness,"" he added.
As we have reported, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile ""when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.""
Amid growing evidence the drug is not effective, the FDA announced in June that it had revoked the EUA for the drugs because they are ""unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19,"" and that the ""known and potential benefits"" of the drugs ""no longer outweigh"" the risks — which can include ""serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.""
Fauci has long made clear his doubts about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, and Trump has heard him.
Correction, Aug. 11: We initially miscalculated the number of counties that did not have any coronavirus cases in the past week.

      Trump Wrong About Ventilators

		President Donald Trump falsely claimed that his administration was not initially able to meet the increasing demand for ventilators to treat COVID-19 patients because ""we weren’t left ventilators by a previous administration.""
We can’t say for sure how many ventilators there were in the Strategic National Stockpile when Trump took office, but there were likely thousands.
Update, June 25: In a June 20 statement to FactCheck.org, an HHS spokesperson said the SNS had 16,660 ventilators ""immediately available for use"" when the federal government began distributing them to states in March. The spokesperson also told us none of the 16,660 ventilators ready for use in March was ""acquired"" by the Trump administration, which began announcing federal contracts for new ventilators in April. For more, read our June 22 post ""Trump Inherited More Ventilators Than Have Been Distributed.""
A 2017 article published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated there were roughly 9,000 ventilators in the federal stockpile as of at least 2010, and ventilators in the U.S. stockpile had never been distributed in the 20 years prior to the global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, according to Richard Branson, a respiratory care specialist and professor at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who advises the federal government on ventilator supplies.
Reporters also described seeing some of the government’s stash of ventilators in 2016, when they toured at least one of the secret U.S. warehouses where the breathing machines and other equipment are stored in the event of a health crisis, such as a pandemic.
Trump repeatedly has made the general claim that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies was ""empty"" or ""bare"" when he took office. That’s false, as we have written before.
But he specifically said there weren’t any ventilators when answering reporters’ questions during a recent White House event about his administration’s efforts to protect seniors from contracting the novel coronavirus. Seniors are vulnerable to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, particularly those in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. 
Trump, April 30: We had a ventilator problem that was caused by the fact that we weren’t left ventilators by a previous administration. The cupboards were bare, as I say often.  And not only are the cupboards full now, we have ventilators; we’re the king in the world of ventilators. We have thousands and thousands of them now being delivered.
But it’s not true that the Trump administration did not inherit any ventilators. Reporters said they saw ventilators during a tour of one of the U.S. facilities housing the stockpile’s massive inventory.
""As we walk, I hear a loud hum. It’s a giant freezer packed with products that have to be kept cold,"" wrote NPR science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce in June 2016 — only months before Trump was inaugurated in January 2017.
""Just outside it, there are rows upon rows of ventilators that could keep sick or injured people breathing. [Shirley] Mabry explains that they’re kept in a constant state of readiness. ‘If you look down to the side you’ll see there’s electrical outlets so they can be charged once a month,’ she says. Not only that—the ventilators get sent out for yearly maintenance.""
VICE News also reported seeing the machines when its film crew visited one of the facilities for an episode of ""VICE News Tonight"" that aired in December 2016.  
""[A]lthough we couldn’t reveal where it was or what exactly it had inside. It looked like a prepper’s Ikea, with row after row of containers filled with mystery medications and equipment — including that one item everyone’s been talking about lately, ventilators,"" Vice News said.
We can’t say exactly how many ventilators were in the stockpile when Trump was inaugurated; the federal government doesn’t usually publicize the specific numbers.
But, as of 2010, there were around 9,000, according to a 2017 article published in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. And in an April 7 article, the technology news website Recode quoted Branson, an adviser to the federal government, as saying, ""This is the first time in 20 years ventilators from the stockpile have been used.""
In fact, a 2012 report from the Department of Health and Human Services said: ""During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, ventilator shortages were not reported to HHS, and ventilators were not deployed from the SNS."" That’s the same pandemic that caused the SNS to distribute ""12.5 million regimens of antiviral drugs, 19.6 million pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE), 85.1 million N95 respirators, and 2,129 doses of IV peramivir,"" according to Greg Burel, the stockpile’s former director.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there were 12,700 ventilators in the stockpile, as of March 15. At the time, the CDC says there were about 9,500 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. Currently, there are nearly 1.1 million cases in the U.S. and more than 64,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.
Trump can argue that there initially weren’t enough ventilators to accommodate every state’s request, although the stockpile was never designed to be able to do that, Burel has said.
But it’s simply not the case that the federal government did not have any ventilators on hand when Trump took the reins from President Barack Obama more than three years ago.

		Quick Take
Facebook posts falsely claim that House Democrats included $25 million to boost their own salaries in their proposal for the coronavirus-related stimulus package. That funding is not for legislators’ pay increases; it’s also in the bill being advanced by the Republican-controlled Senate.


Full Story 
Members of Congress are working toward passing a bipartisan, nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to bolster the economy in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. It would include direct payments to Americans, loans for small businesses, support for hospitals and more.
But online, some on social media are using various memes and posts to spread a falsehood that House Democrats are also trying to slip in $25 million to increase their own pay.
That’s wrong.
 
A number of the posts specifically refer to a $25 million funding allocation for the House referenced in a version of the package proposed by House Democrats on March 23.
That House proposal included $25 million for ""Salaries and Expenses"" for the chamber — which would be ""allocated in accordance with a spend plan submitted to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives by the Chief Administrative Officer and approved by such Committee.""
But the bill never said it was for legislators’ salaries. Nor does the version of the stimulus package being worked out in the Republican-controlled Senate — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act — which similarly outlines $25 million for the House.
A spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee called the pay-raise claims circulating online ""absurd and inaccurate.""
""The funding is to support the House’s capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network,"" Evan Hollander told us in an email. ""It will also provide for reimbursement costs for the staff of the House Child Care Center and covers the costs of the House food service contracts. In addition, it will support the Sergeant-At-Arms on continuity of operations matters.""
He added: ""Moreover, Member salaries are funded through the Treasury pursuant to the Constitution and are not funded through appropriations.""
Also, as we said, the $25 million funding for the House is included in the Senate version of the package, according to draft legislation posted March 25 by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The measure — which includes $93 million for the legislative branch collectively, including $10 million for the Republican-controlled Senate — has been agreed to in principle by congressional leaders and the White House.
A document posted by the Senate Appropriations Committee breaking down emergency appropriations in the package describes the $25 million allocated for the House in the same way Hollander does.
It’s important to note, as we’ve explained before, that the 1989 Ethics Reform Act established an automatic adjustment formula to decide annual changes to lawmakers’ salaries.
That automatic adjustment formula is ""based on changes in private sector wages and salaries as measured by the Employment Cost Index,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. The percentage increase cannot surpass that for federal employees who fall under the ""General Schedule"" classification. It automatically goes into effect unless Congress statutorily denies it, which it has done every year since 2009.
Democrats had considered in mid-2019 ending that decade-long hiatus and allowing the automatic pay increase to go through, but backed away from the idea following a backlash from within the party.
Update, April 1: The president signed the $2 trillion stimulus package into law on March 27. Adults with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will receive $1,200 (married couples with an adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less will receive $2,400, plus $500 per child). The payment amount will scale down by income, phasing out at $99,000 for single individuals and $198,000 for couples without children.

      Trump and the Coronavirus Death Projections

		In his March 30 appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" President Donald Trump suggested an estimate that the novel coronavirus might kill a huge number of Americans was a new revelation.
The president said in the interview that ""the answer"" to his question about how many people could die if the U.S. did nothing to combat the new coronavirus ""came in yesterday through"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. ""[I]f we just kept the business as usual, didn’t do anything to stop it or impede it, could have been 2.2 million people could have died.""
But that frightening possibility had been public knowledge for more than two weeks. The number was contained in a report issued by Imperial College London on March 16.
What’s more, the lead author of the report, epidemiology professor Neil Ferguson, told the New York Times that the British researchers had shared their projections with a White House task force a week before and had sent an early copy of the report to the White House.
Birx herself referenced the British report at a coronavirus task force press briefing on March 16, when the Trump administration announced that it would issue more restrictive social distancing guidelines. Birx said the White House task force — working with groups in the U.K. and drawing on ""new information coming out from a model"" — recommended limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people. The Trump administration’s recommendations were consistent with the British report made public that same day.



Projections of possible deaths from COVID-19, Imperial College study, March 16
 

And the British report was not the first indication that the coronavirus death toll could be quite high if the disease were left unchecked.
On March 13, the New York Times reported that officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and epidemic experts from around the world had gathered on a conference call the previous month to explore worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus’ toll. The CDC modeled four scenarios and estimated that 200,000 to 1.7 million U.S. residents could die, the Times reported.
Yet, Trump portrayed the potential death toll as new information on March 29, when he announced that he was extending the federal social distancing guidelines until April 30. Previously he had expressed an interest in relaxing them sooner as way to revive the struggling U.S. economy, saying on March 24 that he would ""love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" April 12. 
At the White House briefing at which he announced the extension, Trump also cited the 2.2 million potential casualty figure — an estimate he said he had been seeking for ""a long time.""
Trump, March 29: I just want to reiterate, because a lot of people have been asking, ""Well, what would have happened if we did nothing? Did nothing — we just rode it out.""
And I’ve been asking that question to Tony and Deborah, and they’ve been talking to me about it for a long time. Other people have been asking that question. And I think we got our most accurate study today, or certainly most comprehensive.
Think of the number: 2.2 — potentially 2.2 million people if we did nothing. If we didn’t do the distancing, if we didn’t do all of the things that we’re doing.
With social distancing remaining in place, Trump said he hoped to severely limit the number of deaths.
""If we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job,"" he said.
In an appearance on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" on March 29, Fauci said that even with mitigation efforts that have been put into effect, 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die from the disease.
Trump struck a very different tone at a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24, when he was still talking about reopening the country by Easter.
Trump, March 24: Well, you have to make the decision. Look, we lose thousands — I brought some numbers here. We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off — I mean, every year. Now, when I heard the number — you know we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually, this year we’re having a bad flu season. But we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies and say, ""Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore."" We have to get back to work.
This was more than a week after news reports about the British report and the CDC’s worst-case scenarios for coronavirus.
According to CDC statistics on March 30, there have been 140,904 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the U.S., and 2,405 deaths.
In addition to warning against social gatherings with more than 10 people, the federal guidelines urge Americans not to eat at restaurants or go to bars, to steer clear of discretionary travel, and to frequently wash their hands for 20 seconds. While the guidelines are voluntary, many state and local governments have implemented stricter limits. Until Trump extended them, the federal guidelines were set to expire March 31.

      Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge ‘Only’ Due to Testing, Misleads on Deaths

		With some states posting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump continues to downplay the concern, falsely asserting that cases are up ""only because of our big number testing,"" and pointing to the falling number of daily COVID-19 deaths. 
Data shows that in many places, the uptick in cases outstrips the increase in testing — and experts say it’s too soon to know whether a surge in deaths will follow.
In recent weeks, the number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. has spiked, particularly in places such as Texas, Arizona and Florida, each of which has broken records for the highest number of newly reported infections.
Trump, however, has repeatedly denied that the rise in cases reflects increased transmission of the virus, and has instead insisted that increased testing is the cause.
The president began pinning the blame on testing as early as June 15, when in a tweet he said that because U.S. testing ""is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country … it shows more cases."" He called testing a ""double edged sword"" because it is ""good to"" have, but ""[m]akes us look bad.""
As we have explained before, the United States’ testing program has not performed as many tests as other countries given the size of the nation’s outbreak. And while testing can explain some of the additional cases, it fails to account for all of them, as the proportion of positive tests is increasing in many states.
At a June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump once again called testing a ""double-edged sword"" and even claimed that he had asked his ""people"" to ""slow the testing down, please."" The White House said the comment was a joke, only to have Trump tell a reporter two days later, ""I don’t kid."" 
There is no evidence that Trump ever asked any official to impede testing, and in a congressional hearing multiple members of the coronavirus task force said they had not been asked to put the brakes on testing.
""[T]o my knowledge, none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing,"" said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, emphasizing that testing was important for both contact tracing and for surveillance. 
Nevertheless, Trump continues to perpetuate the false idea that testing — and testing alone —  is why the U.S. is seeing a surge in cases, despite mounting hospitalizations and a rise in the percentage of tests coming back positive in certain parts of the country.
""Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding,"" Trump declared in an early morning June 23 tweet. ""With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!""
Later in the day, the president doubled down in another tweet, this time also pointing to the disconnect between the rising case counts and the falling number of COVID-19 deaths.
""Cases up only because of our big number testing,"" he wrote, retweeting another person’s graph plotting daily COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. ""Mortality rate way down!!!""
The same day, Trump also said that with more tests, more mild cases were being detected.
""By having more cases, it sounds bad, but actually what it is, is we’re finding people. Many of those people aren’t sick or very little. You know, they may be young people,"" he told reporters on the South Lawn before departing for Arizona. ""But what’s happened is, because of all of the cases that we find, we have a very low mortality rate, just about the best in the world.""
The United States’ mortality rate is not ""just about the best in the world."" According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S. has the seventh highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and third highest per-capita death rate.
In another tweet on June 25, Trump once again returned to the same argument. ""The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down,"" he said. ""The Fake News doesn’t like telling you that!""
It’s true that daily COVID-19 deaths continue to decline, and it’s possible that with increased testing more mild cases are being caught relative to earlier in the pandemic. But scientists say it’s premature to conclude that the current upticks won’t lead to increases in mortality later.
Not Just More Testing
As we have noted before, Trump is wrong to say that testing is the only reason why cases are increasing in the U.S. On the contrary, data from some of the places being hardest hit shows that the case numbers are outpacing any increases in testing, since the percentage of positive tests is climbing — sometimes dramatically so.
In Arizona, for example, the seven-day average for the test positivity rate, as analyzed by Johns Hopkins University, is now 23%, up from around 7% in mid-May. Texas is also seeing an increase, from a rolling average of around 5% at the end of May to more than 11% on June 24.
And in Florida, where the number of tests performed daily has of late been flat or falling, 14% of tests are coming back positive — well above the recommended target of 5%, which the state had been hitting for nearly all of May.
Even the national daily test positivity rate, which was below 5% in early June, has started to tick up, reaching 7.5% on June 24, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
Katherine Ellingson, an epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, told us that the differential between case counts and tests ""suggests that community transmission is increasing, and that increasing case counts are not simply an artifact of testing.""
""Further, the suggestion that we are over-testing as a nation is misleading. Certainly in Arizona, our current testing capacity is woefully inadequate,"" she said, noting the state’s high test positivity rate. ""This suggests that testing capacity is lagging behind levels of transmission. Indeed testing is not available for all who seek it in our state, and delays in test acquisition and receipt of results weaken the utility of those tests in preventing spread.""
Some areas are also seeing increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations, which should not occur if additional testing is the only driver of more coronavirus cases.
In Texas, COVID-19 hospitalizations have nearly tripled since Memorial Day. And in Arizona, the number of positive or suspected patients in hospitals across the state hit a record high of 2,453 on June 24, according to the state’s COVID-19 dashboard (see ""Hospital COVID-19 Specific Metrics"").
""This is highly concerning because it reflects increasing absolute levels of severe COVID-19 illness among Arizonans,"" said Ellingson, ""as well as a narrowing safety margin for anyone needing hospital care for any reason.""
As Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, explained on Twitter on June 24, testing does turn up more cases. 
""That is indeed the point. But in many of the states experiencing a resurgence, hospitalizations are up and the percent of tests that are positive is rising. Those are signs of trouble,"" she said, adding, ""It’s not just testing.""

Notably, some politicians have now acknowledged that there are concerning outbreaks in these areas.
""Even with the testing increasing or being flat, the number of people testing positive is accelerating faster than that,"" said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on June 20. ""You know that’s evidence that there’s transmission within those communities.""
DeSantis, who is a Republican, initially denied his state was experiencing an uptick in community spread of the virus.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, also a Republican, said on June 22, ""To state the obvious, COVID-19 is now spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas, and it must be corralled."" 
On June 25, Abbott announced a pause on reopening the state — and in an effort to avoid overtaxing hospitals, prohibited elective procedures in four counties most affected by the coronavirus.
Understanding COVID-19 Mortality Trends
In his tweets, Trump also touted the United States’ mortality figures, emphasizing that COVID-19 deaths are in decline. 
That’s true — according to the COVID Tracking Project, national COVID-19 fatalities are down to fewer than 600 a day, using a seven-day rolling average, from a peak of more than 2,000 in mid-April.

But focusing on the death figures when thinking about the current uptick in COVID-19 cases is potentially misleading, experts said, because it could be that the deaths will simply come later.
""Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,"" Fauci said in his June 23 testimony, in response to a question about the disconnect between the rising case counts and declining deaths. ""You might remember that at the time that New York was in their worst situation where the deaths were going up and yet the cases were starting to go down, the deaths only came down multiple weeks later.""
""So you’re seeing more cases now while the deaths are going down,"" Fauci continued. ""The concern is if those cases then infect people who wind up getting sick and go to the hospital, it is conceivable you may see the deaths going up. So I think it’s too early to say because the deaths are going down.""
In a June 16 press call, Harvard epidemiologist Caroline Buckee also expressed this concern.
""I suspect in many cases, it’s just the time lag,"" she said when asked why Florida hadn’t seen an increase in deaths, despite the increased COVID-19 caseload. ""The cases that happen now will result in deaths in about three weeks. So we think that the time lag between cases and hospitalization is about two weeks, and then another week for people to start dying.""
Other scientists have noted that the lag can be even longer, and that death data may still be trickling in as fatalities get reported.
""That can lag by a month or even more, depending on how long the person was ill,"" said Cindy Prins, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, in a phone interview. She added that in her state, there hasn’t been a big decrease in mortality since the end of May.
""It’s looking kind of flat right now,"" she said. ""But we haven’t really necessarily caught up with those numbers yet to know that they’re the final numbers.""
There are hints that the current surge in cases might lead to fewer deaths than before. In Florida, for example, Prins said there had been a shift toward people ages 15 to 34 testing positive, and Ellingson said in Arizona, the average age for diagnostic testing ""has dropped slightly."" 
The decline in age could reflect the fact that younger and working-age people are heading back to work or are socializing more without doing physical distancing, Ellingson said, or that older folks are being especially cautious, or both.
Given that younger people generally are at lower risk for hospitalization and death, Prins said, the downward trend in age could be a positive sign, at least for now.
""But the worry is that people within those groups still can get very sick and die,"" she said. ""They’re not invincible.""
And young people can still spread the virus. ""I can’t predict what’s going to happen, but the concern would be as you get more circulation, even if it is among younger people,"" Prins said, ""that that’s going to skew towards our older people again as they get exposed.""
Johns Hopkins’ Rivers said in a tweet that the fact that deaths are down nationally ""could mean more mild infections are being caught, or that the average age of new cases is drifting down or that treatments are improving.""
But, she added, ""Most states don’t report case severity or time-varying age breakdowns, so it’s tough to say,"" and ""deaths are also a delayed indicator, so I hope this holds.""
Buckee, too, said that more infections in younger people could be due to older people avoiding interactions with others, or young people not practicing physical distancing — and noted that it’s also possible that hospitals have learned how to better manage COVID-19 patients.
""[W]e don’t know yet which is most likely, and I would say it’s too early to rule out an uptick in deaths from the recent increase in cases,"" she told FactCheck.org in an email.
William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in a June 25 press call that he thought the finding of more infections in younger people across the Sun Belt offered a ""crumb of comfort.""
""What this likely means is that the outbreak across the South is being recognized at a somewhat earlier stage than the outbreak in the Northeast was,"" he said. ""And that’s a good thing, because it means that if there’s any window of opportunity for action, it’s like right now — and [the] things you do now will have great consequences. However, if you do not take action now, then the community transmission is going to continue to build. And then, sooner or later, it is going to get into those at risk."" 
""In time, those people will start to go to the hospital and they will start to die,"" Hanage said. ""It may not be immediate. It may be a couple of weeks, it may be a little bit longer. But it will happen — and remember it’s happening in a far larger total population than the outbreaks in the spring were.""
In other words, even though it’s good news that deaths are down now, it’s not yet clear if that trend will continue — and that will depend in part on how communities respond.
Hanage said if officials are looking at death counts today, they should be prepared to look again in a month or so. ""Hold on to that statistic if you’re going to follow it, because you might not find it so attractive in a couple weeks,"" he said.

		On six separate occasions, President Donald Trump has claimed that Europe’s excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic is 33% to 40% higher than America’s. But that’s only possible when cherry-picking numbers or ignoring Europe’s larger population. 
It’s a meaningless comparison anyway, experts say, given differences in population age and density, a later arrival of the coronavirus on American shores, and a still raging epidemic in the U.S.
The president recited the misleading statistic in three consecutive press briefings, starting on Aug. 11, when he said, ""Europe has experienced a nearly 40% higher excess mortality rate than the United States.""
The following day, he dropped the caveat of ""nearly,"" and declared that ""Europe has experienced a 40% higher excess mortality than the United States."" And on Aug. 13, he iterated the point again.
Trump then repeated the claim for a fourth time on Aug. 17 in a speech in Mankato, Minnesota, after touting a decline in the fatality rate for the elderly. 
""Europe by contrast has experienced a 40% higher rate of excess mortality than the United States,"" he said, before referencing Minnesota Republican Rep. Tom Emmer. ""Think about that, you don’t hear those stories, they don’t tell you that Tom, do they? You don’t hear that in Congress, right?""
Then, in a fifth reprisal during an Aug. 19 briefing, Trump lowered the number. ""Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33% higher than the United States — evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations,"" he said. Trump then repeated the lower figure in an Aug. 23 briefing.
The recurring statistic is part of a larger effort to cast the U.S.’s experience with the coronavirus in a better light than that of its European counterparts. But, as we have written, Trump has erred on these types of comparisons before, falsely claiming that the U.S. per capita death rate is lower than ""most"" of Western Europe and leaving the misleading impression that America is doing better than other countries experiencing recent upticks in cases.
Uncertain Statistic
It’s unclear how the president arrived at his 40% higher excess mortality figure. We asked the White House repeatedly for a source for the statistic and for more information on how it was being calculated, such as how Europe was being defined, but we did not receive a reply. 
So we dug into available estimates of excess mortality and also asked experts at the University of Oxford, Janine Aron and John Muellbauer, who had written a primer on excess mortality for the website Our World in Data. 
The data we found do not support the president’s claim — at least not in any fair comparison of excess mortality. And an independent analysis triggered by our query revealed that when the most comparable part of the U.S. is stacked up against the hardest-hit countries in Europe, America fares worse — not better — on measures of excess mortality.
First, it’s useful to explain what excess mortality is and why it’s important during a pandemic such as COVID-19. As the Our World in Data primer details, excess mortality refers to the actual number of deaths, regardless of cause, minus a ""normal"" or expected number of deaths during a given time period. Because reporting of COVID-19 deaths may be spotty and incomplete, especially early on, statisticians can instead look at excess mortality to get a sense of the impact of the virus.
As Aron and Muellbauer write, ""Excess mortality data can be used to draw lessons from cross- and within-country differences and help analyse the social and economic consequences of the pandemic and relaxing lockdown restrictions."" 
Not all of the excess deaths during a pandemic period are from people who succumbed to COVID-19, although many of them likely are. Excess mortality also captures the indirect effects of the pandemic, including people who may have died from other causes because they avoided seeking medical attention or from overwhelmed hospitals, as well as increases in suicide. 
Similarly, excess mortality factors in the benefits of pandemic conditions, such as a reduction in deaths from car accidents as well as fewer deaths from other communicable diseases that may have declined as a result of COVID-19-inspired physical distancing and other public health measures.
U.S. vs. Europe
As a first crude approximation, we turned to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes estimates of excess mortality during the pandemic. According to the agency’s calculations, between Feb. 1 and Aug. 8, there have been between 174,930 and 235,728 excess deaths across the country, for a midpoint value of 205,329 deaths.
In comparison, through week 33 of this year, or Aug. 16, 204,634 excess deaths occurred in 24 European countries or parts of countries, according to estimates by EuroMOMO, a group monitoring mortality trends in Europe.
The two numbers — which are about equal — are meaningless on their own, but when adjusted for population, there are 665 excess deaths per million people for the covered European area, compared with 622 excess deaths per million in the U.S., using the midpoint value.
That works out to Europe having around 7% more excess deaths per capita than the U.S. The percentage rises as high as 26% if the lower U.S. value is used, and the roles reverse — with the U.S. having a 7% higher excess mortality rate than Europe — if the upper-end CDC estimate is used. 
The comparison is by no means perfect. The time ranges for the calculations differ; the two estimates aren’t using the same methodology, and the data do not capture all of Europe. As Muellbauer told us, the estimate favors the U.S. because the areas of Europe in the EuroMOMO network tend to include those most affected by the virus and omit countries that weren’t hit as hard.
Still, the result suggests that Trump is off-base to claim Europe’s excess mortality is 33% to 40% higher than America’s. The only plausible way to get close to such a number requires one to select the lower-bound of the CDC estimate, and Trump would still be exaggerating.
For a better approximation, we also compiled data from the Human Mortality Database, which has been tracking weekly death counts for 29 countries — including most of Europe and the U.S. — as a result of the pandemic.
At Muellbauer’s suggestion, we used the visualization tool to pull data for the number of excess deaths in 2020 for each country over the same time period, using the same reference years of 2015-2019 whenever possible (Germany’s reference range was 2016-2019). We chose to analyze deaths through June 21 (week 25) because that was the latest available data for France — and would make the fairest comparison for the U.S. (Slovenia was excluded because it lacked data past week 13.)
Over the Jan. 1 through June 21 period, we found the U.S. had 183,570 excess deaths, while Europe had 242,739. Using the sheer numbers, Europe’s raw excess mortality is 32% higher than the U.S.’s — similar to Trump’s downwardly revised claim of 33%. 
But if that is the origin of Trump’s statement, it’s a distortion because it doesn’t account for the larger population of Europe, or the fact that compared with the expected number of deaths, Europe’s rate of excess mortality is in fact lower than that of the United States.
Indeed, by this analysis, U.S. mortality is 13.3% higher than normal, versus just 10.1% for Europe. In other words, compared to what is expected, Europe’s death rate is not as elevated — and in fact, America’s excess mortality rate is 32% higher than Europe’s, not the other way around.
Misleading Comparison
While we sought to answer the question of how America’s excess mortality fares in comparison with Europe’s, experts cautioned that the comparison itself was misguided.
Calling Trump’s claim of 40% higher excess mortality ""highly suspect,"" Aron and Muellbauer said the fundamental concern is that the U.S. is very different from Europe.
""Whether he means all of Europe or particular countries, President Trump is not comparing like-for-like,"" they said in an email. ""First, the U.S. as a whole has a much larger, younger, less dense population with a rather smaller fraction living in big cities than the major European countries, and we know that big cities and older populations suffered much worse excess mortality. Second, the pandemic is still raging in many states in the South and the West so that it is premature to compare the whole of the U.S. with the main European countries.""
A better comparison, Aron and Muellbauer said, is to see how well the Northeastern U.S. stacks up with the major European countries, since the timing of the pandemic and population characteristics, including population density, are more similar.
In an analysis shared with FactCheck.org and subsequently posted to the Our World in Data website, the two economists calculated P-scores, or the percentage of excess mortality, during the 11 peak weeks of the pandemic for a variety of Western European countries and the Northeastern U.S., which includes Maine, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.
The duo found mortality to be 76% higher than normal in the Northeastern U.S. — well above the level of any other European country. Spain was closest, with a 55% increase, followed by England and Wales (54%), Scotland (41%), Italy (40%), Belgium (38%), the Netherlands (30%), Sweden (28%), France (22%) and Germany (6%).
On a per capita basis, the Northeastern U.S. had 142 excess deaths per 100,000 people — again more than any of the analyzed European countries. Spain had the highest per capita excess mortality in Europe, with 103 excess deaths per 100,000.
All plausible measures of excess mortality, they said, are ""substantially worse"" in the Northeast than in the worst-affected countries in Europe. ""This is despite the later arrival of the pandemic in the Northeast,"" they added, ""which gave U.S. policy-makers three more weeks warning than European countries such as Italy and Spain.""
Moreover, Aron and Muellbauer expect that as more time elapses, the U.S. is likely to fare worse in comparison with Europe because of its larger ongoing epidemic.
Other than cherry-picked or misleading figures, we find no evidence to back Trump’s claim, and using a more appropriate comparison with Europe shows that the opposite is true — that even with multiple advantages, the U.S. has experienced a higher rate of excess mortality.
Update, August 27: We updated the article to include a link to Aron and Muellbauer’s full analysis, available on the Our World in Data website.

		SciCheck Digest
Social media posts are misrepresenting an old photo from France by suggesting the sea of people in the streets shows ""[p]eople are waking up against vaccine tyranny."" The photo actually shows a celebration in Paris after France won the 2018 World Cup.

              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
An image spreading widely on social media shows a woman holding the French flag behind her, with throngs of people filling the street below. It captures a celebration in Paris following France’s victory in the 2018 World Cup final.
But social media users now are misrepresenting that photo to suggest it was taken recently at a protest against COVID-19 vaccines.
""France today,"" reads a tweet from July 18. ""People are waking up against vaccine tyranny and new world order!""
The photo appeared the same day in a post on Telegram with the same text.
Another tweet of the photo on July 18 — shared nearly 2,000 times — was paired with a more implicit message: ""‘They say 2 million people took to the streets of Paris’ Shit’s getting real folks – do you want to be on the side of good or evil for this one?""
On Facebook, a user shared the photo and declared, ""Yeah, that’s right Millions of people are awake, MILLIONS. Go FRANCE and anyone who isn’t complying to the trash mind control."" More than 250 users shared the post.
The photo also appeared on Instagram with a message against the vaccines in a post liked nearly 600 times. The user said she had ""no way of proving this photo is real but it’s supposedly from France.""
There have indeed been well-attended protests in France against COVID-19 vaccines, with some opposing a measure by the government that will require individuals to show proof of vaccination — or a negative COVID-19 test or recent recovery from the disease — in order to enter public events or venues.
Reverse image searches, however, show the photo circulating on social media with anti-vaccine messages is not from such a protest — but from a July 15, 2018, World Cup celebration.
The photo shows a swarm of celebrators taking to the streets after France’s win over Croatia in the World Cup. It was credited to Ludovic Marin of the news agency AFP. A caption indicates it was taken from atop the Arc de Triomphe.

		As the Democratic National Convention kicks off today, we thought it would be helpful to highlight some of the claims we have fact-checked from presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden over the course of the campaign so far.
For more on each statement, follow the links to our full stories. All of our articles on Biden can be found here.
Next week, when the Republican convention begins, we will present a similar compilation of claims we have checked from President Donald Trump.
Claims are grouped by subject.
COVID-19
Biden falsely accused Trump of being late in imposing travel restrictions on China. In fact, the United States was not late getting off the mark compared with other countries around the world.
On ABC’s ""This Week"" on April 5, Biden said ""45 nations had already moved"" to restrict travel from China ""before the president moved."" Said Biden, ""We started off awfully slow.""
Think Global Health, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, tracked the travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19. Its country-by-country analysis shows that in the days after the World Health Organization on Jan. 30 declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, 36 countries imposed travel restrictions, including the U.S., by Feb. 2. ""What this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,"" a co-author of the tracker, Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us via email.
""Trump, Biden Spin China Travel Restrictions,"" April 6, 2020 
Biden was wrong when he said that the Trump administration made ""no effort"" to get U.S. medical experts into China as the novel coronavirus epidemic spread there early this year. ""[W]hen we were talking … early on in this crisis, we said — I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what’s actually happening,"" Biden said at a CNN virtual town hall on March 27. ""There was no effort to do that.""
That isn’t true. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to get into China just one week after China reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019. ""On January 6, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a Jan. 28 press conference. ""I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China’s Minister of Health on Monday, and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today."" More than a week later, Azar said at a Feb. 7 press conference that ""our longstanding offer to send world-class experts to China to assist remains on the table."" A team of public health experts from the WHO with two U.S. members was allowed by Chinese authorities to visit Wuhan, where the outbreak began, later in February. 
""Biden’s False Claim on Trump’s Response to Coronavirus,"" April 1, 2020
""Biden’s Misleading Ad About Sending Experts to China,"" April 23, 2020
In late March, Biden and Trump traded barbs over the use of the Defense Production Act to compel companies to manufacture medical supplies to treat those infected with the coronavirus. Biden said Trump was too slow to act; the Trump campaign said Trump did invoke the act, and that Biden was exaggerating how early he had begun calling for its use. We found that both sides were spinning things.
On March 18, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act ""just in case we need it,"" but he stopped short of implementing the act to force production of certain goods. It wasn’t until March 23 that Trump invoked the act to compel General Motors to begin producing ventilators. As recently as mid-summer, some medical workers and elected officials continued to criticize Trump for failing to use the full force of the act to stay ahead of supply shortages.
However, we also found no evidence that Biden — who claimed to have supported invoking the act two to three weeks before Trump first invoked it — had been calling for use of the law as early as he said.
""Trump, Biden and the Defense Production Act,"" April 2, 2020
In the March 15 Democratic debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden criticized Trump’s response to the coronavirus, falsely saying that the World Health Organization offered the U.S. diagnostic testing kits, but that ""we refused them."" The U.S. never refused a test from the WHO. Although it’s true that the CDC botched its rollout of tests, which hampered the nation’s ability to detect infections early in the pandemic, the WHO’s test kits are intended for lower-income nations. And it’s standard for countries with the scientific know-how to create their own tests, as the U.S. did.
""Biden, Trump Wrong About WHO Coronavirus Tests,"" March 20, 2020
In a May appearance on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio program, Biden made several misleading or exaggerated claims about the coronavirus.
Biden gave the false impression that a Columbia University study said he called for nationwide social distancing restrictions prior to March 8. ""They pointed out that if he [Trump] had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with this virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead,"" Biden claimed. 
The authors did estimate that earlier implementation of enforcement measures, such as stay-at-home orders, could have prevented 35,927 U.S. COVID-19 deaths between March 8 and May 3. But they didn’t say Biden suggested taking such steps before mid-March, and his campaign didn’t offer an example of Biden calling for social distancing, or something resembling a nationwide lockdown, by early March.
Biden also exaggerated when he said ""I wrote an article"" about the virus on Jan. 27 that ""said this pandemic’s here."" His USA Today op-ed didn’t say the outbreak was already a pandemic. It said Trump was not prepared to lead the country through a ""global health challenge,"" which Biden did predict would ""get worse before it gets better.""
He also took credit in the interview for being ""the guy that said we ought to … find out exactly how many people in the Black community are getting COVID and are dying from it."" But Biden himself had issued a statement saying he was just following what Democratic lawmakers had already asked the Department of Health and Human Services to do in March. He wasn’t taking the lead, as he suggested.

Taxes
In his campaign kickoff speech on April 29, 2019, Biden falsely claimed that ""all of"" the tax cuts signed into law by Trump ""went to folks at the top and corporations that pay no taxes."" Those with higher incomes reaped greater benefits from the tax law, but most households received a tax cut. 
The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 65% of households paid less in federal income tax in 2018 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — a Republican-crafted bill signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017 — than they would have paid under the old tax laws, while about 6% paid more.
A higher percentage of high-income taxpayers got a tax cut, and that tax cut was, on average, greater than the tax cuts for those with lower incomes (both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of after-tax income). But 82% of middle-income earners — those with income between about $49,000 and $86,000 — received a tax cut that averaged about $1,050, the Tax Policy Center estimated.
""Biden’s Campaign Kickoff Claims,"" April 30, 2019
In a speech at the Iowa State Fair in August 2019, Biden claimed that the top 1% pay ""a lower tax rate than you do, because it’s mostly capital gains. … [M]ore than a teacher, a firefighter, a cop. It’s ridiculous."" That’s misleading: The top 1% of taxpayers pay a higher effective tax rate on average than middle-income people.
It’s true that the top personal tax rate on capital gains (20%, or 23.8% including the net investment income tax) is lower than the top rate on ordinary income (which is 37%). And it’s possible some wealthy individuals, if only earning money from capital gains, pay a lower tax rate than some middle-income earners, but that’s the exception.
An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center showed the top 1% — those making over $783,300 ($2.4 million on average) — would pay about an average federal tax rate of 30.2% in 2019. That’s higher than any other income category. The middle 20% of earners — with an expanded cash income of $50,001 to $87,300 — would pay an average federal tax rate of 12.4%, less than half the average rate paid by the top 1%.
""Biden Misleads on Top 1% Tax Rate,"" Aug. 14, 2019
Back in June, Biden went too far when he claimed on more than one occasion that ""most of the conservative think tanks,"" including the Heritage Foundation, agree that the tax cuts championed by Trump ""generated virtually no growth at all.""
There are many economists who agree with Biden that the tax cuts have not generated much, if any, economic growth, and a review by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service of the first-year economic impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did not find evidence of ""large effects particularly in the short run."" But Biden was wrong to claim most conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, agreed.
In fact, economists from the Heritage Foundation say the tax cuts are working: increasing wage growth, business investment and employment. Other conservative groups have argued that the economic growth is simply taking longer than expected, or that it has been offset by other policies, such as the trade war.
""Biden on Economic Growth and Trump’s Tax Cuts,"" June 17, 2020
Medicare/Social Security
During the first head-to-head debate between Biden and Sanders in mid-March, Biden denied Sanders’ claim that he ever talked on the Senate floor ""about the necessity"" of ""cutting Social Security."" In 1984, Biden called for a one-year spending freeze that would have included Social Security, and he boasted about that position from the Senate floor in 1995.
At times, Biden has at least been willing to keep cuts to Social Security as negotiating chips, while other Democrats have taken a harder line that any cuts cannot be part of budget negotiations.
On NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" on April 29, 2007, for example, then-presidential candidate Biden said he would ""absolutely"" put ""age of eligibility"" and ""cost of living"" for Social Security and Medicare on the table during discussions on reducing the deficit. And Biden was also involved in so-called ""Grand Bargain"" negotiations between then-President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner that would have reduced the deficit through a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts — and even changes to Social Security. The New York Times reported that the Grand Bargain would have raised the retirement age and changed the formula for calculating benefits.
But those deals never happened, so we don’t know what Biden might have been willing to compromise on. Agreeing to leave an issue ""on the table"" prior to a negotiation isn’t the same thing as agreeing to do it. And in his 2020 bid, Biden has proposed a plan that would increase revenue for Social Security by eliminating the payroll tax cap and expand benefits for some of the oldest seniors.

""Biden vs. Sanders on Social Security and Medicare,"" Jan. 24, 2020
On the day the White House released the president’s 2021 budget, Biden said the proposal ""eviscerates Medicare."" There are several proposals in Trump’s budget to reduce the growth in Medicare spending over the next 10 years by about $600 billion — a 6% decrease from projected spending. But experts say the measures are similar to last year’s budget proposal, which included bipartisan ideas also supported by Obama. 
The watchdog group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said the Medicare proposals ""represent reductions in costs not cuts to benefits.""
""Competing Claims on Trump’s Budget and Seniors,"" Feb. 18, 2020
Iraq
During a Democratic debate in January, Biden defended his 2002 vote to authorize the use of military force in Iraq, claiming the Bush administration ""said they were not going to go to war"" and only sought weapons inspections. But days before the vote, then-President George W. Bush said, ""I hope this will not require military action, but it may.""
In the days and weeks before and after the war started, Biden said that while the hope was that the resolution could be used to leverage further inspections, he also acknowledged it was a vote for the possibility of war.
""The way the Constitution works is, we voted to give the president the authority to go to war,"" Biden said in a CNN interview two weeks after the war started. ""It’s our decision whether or not we go from a state of peace to a state of war. We gave him that authority. You can second guess whether we should have or not. Once we’ve [done] that then it’s his decision to prosecute the war.""
""FactChecking the January Democratic Debate,"" Jan. 15, 2020
""Biden’s Record on Iraq War,"" Sept. 10, 2019
Last fall, Biden twice claimed that despite voting to authorize military force against Iraq in 2002, he opposed the Iraq war from ""the moment"" it began.
As we wrote then, Biden was a consistent critic of the way the Bush administration handled the war: its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq. Some of his comments proved to be quite prescient, including his warnings about the likely higher-than-expected cost and length of the war, and the complexity of ""winning the peace"" once Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s regime was toppled.
But Biden never outright opposed military action in Iraq in the immediate days after the start of the invasion, as he claimed. The day the war commenced, Biden told CNN: ""There’s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn’t disarm. And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn’t handled all that well, we still have to take him down.""
During a TV interview taped for WMUR in New Hampshire on Sept. 7, 2019, Biden acknowledged that he ""misspoke"" and that ""the misrepresentation was how quickly I said I was immediately against the war. I was against the war internally and trying to put together coalitions to try change the way in which the war was conducted.""
""Biden’s Record on Iraq War,"" Sept. 10, 2019
Crime
The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 that Biden sponsored received bipartisan support at the time, but it has since been criticized for some of its provisions, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, and its impact on mass incarceration. Asked at a CNN town hall to defend the crime bill, Biden contended that the law ""did not put more people in jail, like it’s argued.""
As we have written, critics often lay too much blame on the 1994 bill for the mass incarceration trend in the U.S. that has hit the Black community particularly hard. That was a trend that started two decades prior to the sweeping crime bill in 1994. However, experts told us the law exacerbated the trend.
In the same town hall, Biden misleadingly said the 1994 bill ""had money for state prisons, which I opposed."" He said something similar in a July 2019 speech in South Carolina: ""I didn’t support more money to build state prisons. I was against it."" In fact, Biden did support $6 billion in funding for state prison construction, but not the $10 billion that was part of the final bill.
Finally, Biden misleadingly in the South Carolina speech said that the crime bill ""worked in some areas,"" claiming that ""[t]he violent crime rate was cut in half in America."" The violent crime rate dropped by 46% from 1994 to 2017, but experts say other factors — including social and economic changes, such as an aging population — are responsible for most of that decrease.
""FactChecking Biden’s CNN Town Hall,"" Feb. 28, 2020
""Biden on the 1994 Crime Bill,"" July 12, 2019
In a February Democratic debate, Biden sparred with former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg over the controversial stop-and-frisk police tactic used during Bloomberg’s term as mayor of New York City from 2002 through 2013. Biden wrongly claimed that pressure from the Obama administration was the cause of a decline in stop-and-frisk over Bloomberg’s last two years in office. 
""The reason that stop and frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on. When we sent them there to say this practice has to stop, the mayor thought it was a terrible idea we send them there — a terrible idea,"" Biden said. 
The decline started well before the Obama administration’s intervention.
In June 2013, the Obama administration announced that if a federal judge in a class-action case challenging the policy ruled that New York’s application of the stop-and-frisk policy was unconstitutional, then an independent monitor should be appointed to oversee the program. On Aug. 12, 2013, a U.S. District Court judge did make that ruling.
Bloomberg opposed an independent monitor, and he fought the lawsuit.
But by then, the number of stops had already dropped by 71% in the year-and-a-half before the Obama administration made its first official intervention in the case.
In addition to the lawsuit, there was mounting public opposition to the practice.

Immigrants
Biden falsely claimed that Trump ""asserted that immigrants would, quote, ‘carve you up with a knife.’"" Trump said that about MS-13 gang members, not immigrants in general. 
On Aug. 7, 2019, Biden said Trump ""fomented fears of a caravan heading to the United States, creating a hysteria when he said, look, look what’s marching up, this is an invasion. An invasion. He asserted that immigrants would, quote, ‘carve you up with a knife.’"" It’s true that Trump regularly used the term ""invasion"" when referring to illegal immigration at the southern border. But Trump didn’t say immigrants would ""carve you up with a knife."" He said that about gang members at an Oct. 22, 2018, rally in Houston for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.
At the time, Cruz was running for reelection and faced an unexpectedly tough challenge from Democratic then-Rep. Beto O’Rourke. ""O’Rourke even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation,"" Trump said. ""He doesn’t want to deport them. He says they’re people. They’re people. They carve you up with a knife, but they’re people.""
""Biden Takes Trump Quote Out of Context,"" Aug. 8, 2019
Race Relations
At least three times in February, Biden falsely said he was ""arrested"" 30 years ago while trying to visit Nelson Mandela on Robben Island, where the future leader of South Africa had been imprisoned at the time. But Biden later admitted that he was ""stopped"" at the Johannesburg airport — not arrested. 
While campaigning in Columbia, South Carolina, on Feb. 11, Biden said, ""I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island."" Biden repeated a version of that story twice more while campaigning in Nevada, according to the New York Times, including in Las Vegas on Feb. 18. 
A week after the Times questioned Biden’s account in a Feb. 21 story, Biden told CNN that he refused to take the whites-only door at the airport, because he would have been separated from members of the Congressional Black Caucus. ""Cops, Afrikaners, would not let me go with them. Made me stay where I was,"" Biden said. ""I guess I wasn’t arrested, I was stopped. I was not able to move where I wanted to go.""
""Biden Admits He Was ‘Stopped,’ Not ‘Arrested,’ in South Africa,"" March 2 
Trade
In May, Biden claimed in a ""virtual rally in Wisconsin"" that farm bankruptcies increased 20% last year ""due largely to Trump’s unmitigated disaster of a tariff war."" International trade was a factor, but we found there were additional reasons that predate the trade war — such as years of relatively weak prices, declining incomes and rising farm debt, according to agricultural economists and government reports.
Biden was correct at the time about the percentage increase in farm bankruptcies, 20% for the 12 months ending December 2019, up nearly 100 filings to 595, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. (More recently, the farm bureau reported on Aug. 4 that Chapter 12 farm bankruptcy filings totaled 580 cases for the 12-month period ending in June 2020, up 8% compared with year-ago levels.) 
John Newton, the farm bureau’s chief economist, told us in June there are several reasons for the increase in bankruptcies — not just the trade war. ""It’s one piece of many pieces that combined to hurt the farm economy,"" Newton told us in an interview.

		Quick Take
A ""face mask exempt card"" shared on social media invokes the Americans with Disabilities Act and claims to excuse people from wearing face masks. But the group behind the card — ""Freedom to Breathe Agency"" — is not a government agency, and federal officials say the ADA ""does not provide a blanket exemption"" from requirements to wear masks.


Full Story 
A purported ""face mask exempt card"" has circulated online in recent weeks, suggesting that people can use it — and its citation of federal law — to avoid wearing face masks in public.
But the card is not government-issued and does not give people permission to simply flout face mask requirements. Health officials advise — and many governors mandate — that people wear face masks in public settings to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Iterations of the ""exempt card"" have been circulating since June, and some sharing it encouraged people to print out copies of the card. Other posts showed photos of laminated copies of the card.
A recent version posted by the musician Ted Nugent on Facebook was shared more than 4,000 times.
""I am exempt from any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public,"" the card claims. ""Wearing a face mask poses a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you.""
The card includes a logo for the ""Freedom to Breathe Agency"" and says ""denying access"" to a business or organization ""will be reported to FTBA for further actions."" The card includes a phone number to report violations of the ADA; some of the versions also include a logo for the U.S. Department of Justice.
But the implication that the FTBA is a government agency — and that it has enforcement powers (""further actions"") — is wrong. It’s actually a group that says its mission is to ""stop face mask orders and human rights oppression from spreading nationwide and globally.""
On June 30, the Justice Department warned against such ""[i]naccurate flyers or other postings … regarding the use of face masks and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).""
""Many of these notices included use of the Department of Justice seal and ADA phone number,"" the department said.
It added: ""The ADA does not provide a blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations.""
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which advises people to wear cloth face masks in public settings, does note that such coverings shouldn’t be worn by ""children under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.""
Likewise, the Southeast ADA Center — a project of the Burton Blatt Institute at Syracuse University — says some disabilities may prevent people from wearing face masks.
But that doesn’t mean anyone citing a disability, or showing the viral ""exempt card"" for that matter, can simply bypass face mask requirements enforced by businesses or government agencies.
The Southeast ADA Center said in a recent brief that ""[i]f a person with a disability is not able to wear a face mask, state and local government agencies and private businesses must consider reasonable modifications to a face mask policy so that the person with the disability can participate in, or benefit from, the programs offered or goods and services that are provided.""
""A reasonable modification means changing policies, practices, and procedures, if needed, to provide goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to an individual with a disability,"" the center added.
Examples might include allowing a person to order online or by phone with curbside pickup; permitting someone to wait for an appointment in the car; or carrying out appointments by phone or video.
""What the ADA basically mandates is that they have to consider serving the customer in another way,"" the center’s project director, Vinh Nguyen, told PolitiFact. ""They don’t have to allow entry into the actual store.""
The center’s brief also emphasizes that the ADA’s ""requirement to modify a policy, practice, or procedure does not"" pertain to individuals without disabilities. (That said, the brief notes that ""[g]enerally, guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice has not allowed asking for documentation [regarding a disability] for accommodations at businesses where you would have a brief interaction, such as grocery stores or pharmacies."")
In short, businesses and organizations requiring face masks are expected to accommodate people with disabilities that impede their ability to wear a face mask — but that accommodation may not always mean physical access to the establishment without a mask. And the supposed ""face mask exempt card"" spread across social media doesn’t permit anyone to simply be ""exempt from any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public,"" as it wrongly claims.

		Quick Take
Within hours after his passing, Facebook posts falsely claimed that former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of colon cancer, not COVID-19. Cain did battle and survive cancer in 2006, but his staff confirmed online that his death was due to the novel coronavirus.
Full Story
Herman Cain, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and the CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, passed away at the age of 74 on July 30 in Atlanta, Georgia. 
A co-chair of the group ""Black Voices for Trump"" and a friend of President Donald Trump, Cain attended the president’s Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally on June 20. He was hospitalized nearly two weeks later after showing serious symptoms of COVID-19. 
People close to Cain have said that they do not know where he contracted the virus, given the high amount of traveling Cain had done recently. 
Cain had posted a photo of himself at the indoor rally in Tulsa, seated closely to other attendees without a face mask.
Within hours after the announcement of his death, posts on Facebook falsely claimed Cain did not die from COVID-19, but because of colon and liver cancer. 
One post claims: ""Herman Cain had stage 4 colon cancer. It was NOT the CHINAVIRUS that really took him. Just more lies.""
News outlets — including ABC, CNN and Fox News — have reported that Cain was hospitalized for COVID-19 on July 1 and passed away due to the novel coronavirus.
A post on Cain’s website, made on the day of Cain’s death, confirmed those reports: ""We knew when he was first hospitalized with COVID-19 that this was going to be a rough fight. He had trouble breathing and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. We all prayed that the initial meds they gave him would get his breathing back to normal, but it became clear pretty quickly that he was in for a battle."" 
Cain was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2006. He completed his treatment for colon cancer, including chemotherapy and surgery, by 2007. Cain wrote about the experience in his book, ""This Is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House.""

		In an Oct. 15 town hall on NBC News, President Donald Trump made false and misleading claims on the coronavirus, the economy and more:

Trump was wrong when he said a recent study found ""85% of the people who wear masks catch"" the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this interpretation of its study is ""incorrect.""
The president baselessly claimed the U.S. is ""rounding the corner"" on the coronavirus pandemic. But cases are rising across much of the country.
The president warned of mail-in ballot fraud, but the examples he offered were cases of mistakes, not intentional fraud.
Trump falsely suggested restrictions his administration placed on the deferred deportation program for so-called Dreamers were due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump again claimed Biden would raise taxes on ""everybody"" when two recent estimates figure 80% would see higher after-tax incomes — in effect a tax cut.
Trump repeatedly exaggerated his economic record, at one point inflating peak employment during his term by 7.5 million jobs.
The president declined to disavow the conspiracy theory QAnon, saying he knows ""very little"" about it. We can’t say what he knows, but he has repeatedly shared Twitter posts from accounts that espouse its conspiracy theories.
In speaking about the coronavirus pandemic, Trump inaccurately boasted that the U.S. is ""a winner"" on excess mortality. It’s not.
He said: ""We’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare."" Premiums on average have gone down in the past two years, but that was after a double-digit hike the year before.
Trump argued his administration ""saved 2 million people"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. But that’s based on an estimate for deaths that assumes zero mitigation measures and individual behavior changes.
The president falsely claimed Michigan was in the midst of a lockdown. The vast majority of the state’s businesses are open, as are churches and many schools.
Trump, again, falsely said he was the ""only one"" who wanted to put travel restrictions on China to address COVID-19.
Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration had spied on his campaign. A federal investigation found no evidence of illegal spying.

The NBC News town hall was held in Miami and hosted by ""Today"" show anchor Savannah Guthrie. Over on ABC News, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was answering questions in another town hall at the same time. We fact-checked that as well.
Wrong on Masks
Trump wrongly said the CDC ""came out with a statement that 85% of the people who wear masks catch"" the coronavirus. Rather, among the COVID-19 patients surveyed in the study, 85% reported they ""always"" or ""often"" wore a mask in the 14 days before illness onset.
Trump: I’m OK with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.
The day before the town hall, the CDC released a tweet directly contradicting the president’s claim, saying, ""the interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.""
The major finding of the CDC study, released Sept. 11, was that people in the survey with COVID-19 were twice as likely to have eaten at a restaurant, and that eating in restaurants or drinking in bars might be a higher risk activity. The report also found that people in the study with and without COVID-19 reported high levels of mask wearing in public. Among the approximately 150 COVID-19 patients in the study, 85% reported they ""always"" or ""often"" wore a face mask in the 14 days before illness onset.
Although Trump offered a tepid endorsement of mask-wearing — ""I’m OK with masks. I tell people wear masks"" — as we have written, Trump often equivocates on the subject, as he then did at the town hall, saying: ""I’ve heard many different stories on masks,"" and, ""Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask.""
In the early months of 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other federal public health officials did tell the general public not to wear face masks. However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course on April 3 and recommended that people begin ""wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.""
""Anybody who has been listening to me over the last several months know that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,"" Fauci said in an interview on Sept. 30 on ABC News’ ""Start Here"" podcast.
As the CDC tweeted on Oct. 14, ""Much evidence shows wearing masks in public reduces transmission by blocking exhaled respiratory droplets.""
In an interview on Sept. 24 on the ""Today"" show, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the official messaging from the White House has been ""clear and unambiguous"" in support of public mask-wearing since early April. But the president has continued to hold densely packed rallies where many supporters are not wearing masks. Trump has said little to discourage them.
Not ‘Rounding the Corner’ on Pandemic
Trump insisted that his administration had done well and the coronavirus pandemic was taking a turn for the better.
""And what we’ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job,"" he said. ""And it’s rounding the corner, and we have the vaccines coming and we have the therapies coming.""
Trump has professed that the U.S. is ""rounding the corner"" on the coronavirus for more than a month. But Fauci is on record disagreeing with that assessment.
On Sept. 11, he told MSNBC that he was concerned that the U.S. still had too many infections as the weather turned colder.
""We are plateauing around 40,000 cases a day and the deaths are around 1,000,"" he said, adding that especially as people start to spend more time indoors, ""you don’t want to start off already with a baseline that’s so high.""
Since then, coronavirus cases have only increased. As of Oct. 15, the seven-day average of new cases is topping 53,000 a day, per the COVID Tracking Project, and an analysis from Johns Hopkins University shows cases are on the upswing in many states, especially in the upper Midwest.
An Oct. 15 report from the COVID Tracking Project concluded that a ""third surge"" was underway, with cases and hospitalizations up ""almost everywhere.""
Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers told the New York Times that the country is ""headed in the wrong direction,"" and said the combined indicators of new cases, test positivity rates and hospitalization ""give a very clear picture that we are seeing increased transmission in communities across the country.""
Misleading on Mail-In Ballots
As has been the case for months, the president warned of mail-in ballot fraud in the general election, citing military ballots — seven for him — that were found in a trash can in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. State elections officials have since said the ballots were discarded in error, according to the Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
In a Sept. 30 story, the paper quoted Jonathan Marks, the state deputy secretary for elections, as saying military and overseas ballots sometimes are mailed in envelopes that are not clearly marked as ballots.
When moderator Guthrie pointed out that ""your own FBI director said there’s no evidence of widespread fraud,"" Trump responded: ""Oh, really? Then he’s not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. 50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no. There’s a tremendous problem.""
Trump is wrong to cite Ohio, Virginia and North Carolina as examples of fraud. They were errors, and they have been or are being corrected.
In Ohio, the Franklin County Board of Elections said in an Oct. 9 press release that ""49,669 voters received an inaccurate ballot,"" promising to have correct ballots mailed out in 72 hours. ""We want to make it clear that every voter who received an inaccurate ballot will receive a corrected ballot,"" the board said. ""Stringent tracking measures are in place to guarantee that a voter can only cast one vote.""
In Virginia, ABC7 reported in August that 500,000 ballot applications were mailed to Fairfax County residents by the nonprofit Center For Voter Information with the wrong information. The center blamed a printing error. ""We don’t believe this organization was acting maliciously, they just were not very diligent in their follow-through,"" Gary Scott, the county general registrar and director of elections, told ABC7.
Similarly, 11,000 North Carolinians received inaccurate pre-filled voter registration applications — not actual ballots — from Civitech, a technology vendor that works with companies and campaigns to increase voter registrations, the North Carolina State Board of Elections said in an Oct. 6 press release. Civitech Chief Operating Office Sarah Jackel apologized and promised to send out ""corrected mailers with blank applications to all affected NC recipients.""
Falsely Blaming COVID-19 for DACA Changes
After Trump told an audience member that ""we are going to take care of DACA"" if he is reelected, Guthrie offered some facts about the Trump administration’s current approach to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
""Mr. President, in point of fact, the DACA program, there are — under your administration — no new applicants are allowed and in fact the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years. So in fact the DACA program has been curtailed by your administration,"" Guthrie said.
Trump then falsely suggested that those changes were due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Well what happened is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front,"" he responded. ""Mexico is heavily infected as you know and we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic and other reasons, and crime.""
First of all, the DACA program isn’t for new immigrants. As we’ve explained, the program was started in 2012, and it was designed to defer deportation proceedings for two years for qualified individuals who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children. The program also provides those who are approved work authorization, and the approvals can be renewed. Among the requirements for the program, an individual has to have been living in the U.S. continuously since June 15, 2007.
The Trump administration began in 2017 an effort to ""wind-down"" the program. But in June, the Supreme Court blocked the administration’s termination of the program.
Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, then issued a memo in July outlining ""immediate changes to the DACA policy to facilitate my thorough consideration of how to address DACA in light of the Supreme Court’s decision.""
Among them were the changes cited by Guthrie: ""no new initial requests for DACA should be accepted"" and ""going forward, renewals of deferred action and the accompanying work authorization should be granted for one-year, rather than two-year, periods,"" Wolf’s memo said.
Trump’s Tax Distortion
Trump once again claimed that Biden wants to raise taxes on ""everybody"" including ""middle income"" people, when in fact Biden has vowed he won’t raise federal income taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year.
Trump: And if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do.
As we’ve explained before, Biden’s tax plan would not directly increase federal income taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. But it would also raise corporate income taxes — which experts generally agree would have the indirect effect of holding down wages.
However, Biden has also proposed a number of new tax credits for low- and middle-income earners. And those would offset even the indirect effect of increased corporate taxes. The most recent estimate (issued Oct. 15) by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, for example, calculates that the net result of all Biden’s tax proposals would be, on average, an increase in after-tax income (in effect, a tax cut) for the bottom 80% of households, with the top one-tenth of 1% of earners bearing 70% of Biden’s proposed tax increases.
The business-supported Tax Foundation comes to a similar conclusion in its latest study, figuring that the middle 20% of earners would see a 1.4% increase in after-tax income in 2021. (However, the Tax Foundation also figures that the dynamic effects of Biden’s tax proposals would eventually — over the long run — hold down economic growth by 1.5% and result in a 1.2% reduction in after-tax income for that middle quintile.)
Trump’s Hollow Economic Boasts
Trump painted a too-rosy picture of the economy, past and present.
He boasted that before the COVID-19 recession, ""We were up to 160 million jobs."" Not true. At its peak in February, payroll employment was 152.5 million.
He spoke of gaining 11.4 million jobs. That’s the number of jobs that have been regained in the six months following the loss of 22 million jobs in March and April. Even after that rebound, the U.S. still had nearly 11 million fewer jobs last month than it did in February — and 3.9 million fewer than in the month Trump took office.
He said that gross domestic product ""is going through the roof"" and predicted that ""we’re going to have a phenomenal third quarter."" Maybe so, compared with the second quarter when the economy shrank at an annual rate of 31.4%, by far the worst since the government began keeping records. But 2020 is still expected to be a terrible year for growth overall. For example, the most recent forecast of the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, issued Sept. 16, produced a median estimate of a 3.7% drop in real GDP in the fourth quarter, compared with the same quarter a year earlier. 
And he repeated his false claim that ""we had the greatest economy in the history of our country"" before the recession hit. As we’ve often pointed out, that’s not correct. Economic growth and job growth have been faster, and the unemployment rate has been lower, at several other points in history. For example, GDP grew 2.2% last year and 3.0% the year before, which was Trump’s best. It grew faster — 3.1% — in 2015, which was then-President Barack Obama’s best year.
Trump’s Response on QAnon
Guthrie asked Trump about QAnon and whether he would condemn the widespread conspiracy theory, which hinges in part on the unsupported notion that Trump is working to dismantle an elite child sex trafficking ring involving top Democrats.
Guthrie: ""Let me ask you about QAnon — it is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior of that. Now can you just once and for all state that that is completely not true and disavow QAnon in its entirety?""
Trump responded: ""I know nothing about QAnon. I know very little … I do know they are very much against pedophilia.""
Later, when pressed again by Guthrie, Trump again said, ""I just don’t know about QAnon.""
We don’t know how much Trump knows or doesn’t know about QAnon, but it’s worth noting that the question was far from the president’s first encounter with the high-profile conspiracy theory. The FBI in 2019 described the theory as a domestic terror threat, according to a memo obtained by Yahoo News.
Trump has repeatedly shared posts on Twitter from accounts that espouse the theory, and QAnon signage and paraphernalia has also regularly shown up at Trump rallies.
During a press briefing in August, a reporter asked Trump about his thoughts about the theory’s growth, and he said he didn’t ""know much about the movement"" but had ""heard these are people that love our country.""
Trump, Aug. 19: Well, I don’t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate, but I don’t know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I hear, it’s — these are people that, when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York City in just the last six or seven months — but this was starting even four years ago when I came here. Almost four years; can you believe it?
These are people that don’t like seeing what’s going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and states. And I’ve heard these are people that love our country, and they just don’t like seeing it.
In a follow-up question, the reporter explained to Trump the core gist of QAnon — as Guthrie did — telling him, ""Mr. President, at the crux of the theory is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals. Does that sound like something you are behind or a believer in?""
Trump replied: ""Well, I haven’t — I haven’t heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, you know, if I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it.""
Excess Mortality
In an exchange with Guthrie about how well the U.S. has handled the coronavirus pandemic, Trump falsely claimed that ""we’re a winner"" on excess mortality.
But the U.S. does not have an especially good record on excess mortality, or the number of people who died from any cause, relative to a ""normal"" or expected number of deaths. The metric is an alternative way of estimating the impact of the coronavirus that avoids issues of miscounting or underreporting COVID-19 deaths.
According to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Oct. 12 that compared the U.S. to 14 other countries, America had a higher rate of per capita excess mortality than all but two nations since the start of the pandemic through late July.
Only two countries — Spain and the U.K. — had higher per capita rates for the entire pandemic, and when evaluating excess mortality after May or June, the U.S. had the worst record by far.
Trump has previously bragged that the U.S.’s excess mortality is significantly lower than Europe’s. But as we’ve written, the best estimates suggest the American rate is higher, not lower, than Europe’s.
University of Oxford economists Janine Aron and John Muellbauer concluded in a report published last month that the U.S.’s excess mortality rate is ""substantially worse"" than Europe’s.
In updating our earlier analysis using figures from the Human Mortality Database to include data through Sept. 27, or week 39, we also find that America’s excess mortality rate is 14.5% higher than normal, compared with a collective total of 12.2% for European countries that have data available through the same time period.
And the U.S.’s rate is higher than almost all of the 35 countries included in the database. Only Spain, Chile, England and Wales, and Italy have higher excess mortality rates (Italy includes data only up to week 26).
Affordable Care Act
Trump said: ""We’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare."" Premiums for plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act exchanges have gone down in 2020 (by 3.5% for the lowest-cost ""silver"" level premium) and 2019 (by 0.4%), but that was after a double-digit increase for 2018 plans (up 29.7%).
The large increase then was driven by the Trump administration’s elimination of cost-sharing subsidies on the marketplaces and insurer uncertainty over the ACA’s future. When insurers set marketplace premiums for 2019, the Urban Institute wrote in a January report, ""it became clear that many of them had overreacted to the tumult and uncertainty"" in pricing 2018 plans. So, those premiums, which do ""vary considerably across states,"" the report noted, have now dropped.
The 2 Million Figure
Trump argued that the precautions his administration took to minimize COVID-19 spreading avoided an expected loss of ""2,200,000 people.""
""We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,00 people,"" Trump said. ""One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. … But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who were respected by everybody, 2,200,000 people. We saved 2 million people.""
Trump has made this claim numerous times in the past. As we reported before, the 2.2 million figure is based on a model from Imperial College London in March that predicted U.S. deaths if no mitigation measures were taken and no individual behavior changes occurred.
The figure, therefore, was not intended to be a practical estimate of the true number of losses.
Research does support the idea that lockdowns — which were instituted by states, not Trump — saved lives earlier this year, although it’s hard to say how many. 
For instance, Columbia University researchers estimated that if the U.S. had implemented social distancing one week earlier in March, 36,000 fewer people would have died.
As of Oct. 16, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there have been more than 217,000 deaths in the U.S.
No ‘Lockdown’ in Michigan
Trump repeated a false claim that the state of Michigan was in the midst of a lockdown.
Trump: We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants but nobody else can.
The president had made a similar false claim in an interview Oct. 8 with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, saying that the state was ""closed,"" specifically and falsely mentioning churches and schools. But as we have written, that is not the case. 
In fact, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and a frequent target of Trump, on June 1 lifted the state’s stay-at-home order, which the governor issued in March to combat the spread of COVID-19. The vast majority of the state’s businesses are open with some restrictions, as are churches and schools, although some of the latter are teaching remotely.
The situation in Michigan was complicated on Oct. 2 when the Michigan Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the 1945 law that Whitmer had relied on in issuing her emergency orders on COVID-19. 
In the wake of the ruling, the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services, citing authority not covered by the state Supreme Court ruling, issued an emergency order replicating several aspects of Whitmer’s orders. They include requiring wearing masks at indoor and outdoor gatherings; limiting the size of crowds at indoor and outdoor gatherings, with some exceptions; and requiring bars to close indoor common areas.
The reference to Whitmer’s husband and a boat goes back to an embarrassing contretemps for the couple late in May. Just before Memorial Day, when the governor was urging Michiganders not to crowd waterfront areas due to concern about COVID-19, Whitmer’s husband, Marc Mallory, called a marina in Northern Michigan to see if it could get his boat in the water for the holiday. When told that it was impossible, Mallory asked if the fact that he was married to the governor would help.
News about the request triggered criticism of the Whitmers, particularly from people upset about strict stay-at home policies Whitmer had imposed. The governor said it had simply been an unsuccessful stab at humor on her husband’s part.
Trump’s Repeated Claims on the Travel ‘Ban,’ Biden
Trump repeated some false and misleading claims when answering an audience member’s question about the response to COVID-19 and his purported ""travel ban.""
""I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. [Anthony] Fauci thought it was necessary, who I like, far earlier than the scientists,"" he said. ""I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on, and I did it actually against the advice of a lot of people.""
As we’ve explained before, the travel restrictions were not a ""ban""; tens of thousands of people continued to fly to the U.S. from China.
And Trump wasn’t the ""only one"" who wanted the restrictions. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Feb. 7 that the ""travel restrictions … were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.""
Trump also again claimed that Biden called him ""xenophobic and racist and everything else because I put [the travel policy] in."" Biden did call Trump ""xenophobic"" on the day the restrictions were announced, but it was unclear why he said that, as we’ve reported.
Biden said during a campaign event that Americans ""need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it."" He added, ""This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia — hysterical xenophobia — and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.""
Biden took no public position on the travel restrictions at the time, but his deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an interview on April 3 said that he supported the measures. She further said that the ""reference to xenophobia was about Trump’s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China,"" and that he was not talking about the travel rules.
No ‘Spying’ on Trump Campaign
Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration ""spied on my campaign and they got caught.""
The Justice Department’s inspector general has investigated and found that there is no truth to that allegation. As we wrote, the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation on July 31, 2016, into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government based on information from a ""Friendly Foreign Government,"" according to the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General report on the origins of the investigation.
The inspector general’s report released in December 2019 found no evidence of illegal ""spying"" — either before or after the FBI opened the investigation, known as Crossfire Hurricane. ""We did not find any documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBl’s decision to conduct these operations,"" the report said. ""Additionally, we found no evidence that the FBI attempted to place any CHSs [confidential sources] within the Trump campaign, recruit members of the Trump campaign as CHSs, or task CHSs to report on the Trump campaign.""

		In this video, we take a look at COVID-19 antibody tests, which can reveal whether someone was previously infected with the novel coronavirus — and explain why a positive or negative result may not always be so easy to interpret.

Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins the body generates as part of an immune response to a specific pathogen. Because the proteins are highly specific, tests that can check for the presence of antibodies in a person’s blood have the potential to identify people who have already encountered the virus.
Such information is critical to figuring out how widely the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, has spread, and could also be used to identify people who are immune.
But the tests are only beginning to be rolled out, and many are not accurate enough to use.
Further complicating any use of the tests in the clinic is that scientists don’t know whether antibodies can protect someone from becoming infected again with COVID-19. While experts strongly suspect that will be the case, it’s not known for certain yet, nor it is clear how long any potential immunity would last.

		President Donald Trump continued his misleading attacks on Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as it ravages the state.

With mask use spiking at one New York hospital, Trump speculated that masks may be ""going out the back door,"" suggesting they are being stolen. He has provided no evidence, however, that theft is driving the increase. A bioresponse expert told us that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is ""reasonable"" for hard-hit hospitals ""to see its mask use increase by an order of magnitude.""
The president said that 4,000 ventilators delivered to New York from the federal stockpile are being kept in a ""warehouse which happens to be located – which is interesting — in Edison, New Jersey,"" and so ""maybe they didn’t need them so badly."" Cuomo said the ventilators are being stored in anticipation of peak demand in the coming weeks.

Trump also repeated his misleading claim that ""New York had a chance to get 16,000 ventilators a few years ago and they turned it down."" We wrote about that in our March 26 story ""Trump’s Misleading Ventilator Counter-Punch at Cuomo.""
New York has borne the brunt of much of the early explosion of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Nearly 43% of the more than 156,000 confirmed cases nationwide were located in New York, as of the afternoon of March 30.
During a ""Fox & Friends"" phone interview on March 30, Trump was asked about polls showing high approval for Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic, and speculation in an opinion piece in the New York Times about Cuomo’s presidential potential.
""Well one of the reasons his numbers are high on handling it is because of the federal government, because we give him ships and we give him ventilators and we give him all of the things that we’re giving him,"" Trump said. ""One of the reasons he’s successful is because we’ve helped make him successful.""
During the interview, Trump took several shots at the New York Democrat. The president claimed that despite Cuomo appealing to the federal government to provide more masks, ventilators and other equipment from federal emergency stockpiles, New York has not used the 4,000 ventilators the federal government has provided.
As for the shortage of masks, during a press conference the night before, Trump suggested a spike in the number of masks being used at one New York hospital seemed suspicious, and he implored reporters to look into whether masks may be ""going out the back door.""
High Demand for Masks
Trump’s claim about masks came after Edward Pesicka, president and CEO of Owens & Minor, said during the press conference that despite his company ramping up its production of masks, ""One of the issues we’re struggling with is the demand increase.""
Pesicka then cited ""an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly 10- to 20,000 masks a week are now using 2- to 300,000 masks a week. So you multiply that times … the entire U.S., let alone the same demand outside of the U.S. That’s part of the issue we’re running into, is even with a significant ramp-up in supply, you know, there’s still that demand that is — that is much greater than that supply.""
Trump said those figures were discussed in a private meeting prior to the press conference.
Trump, March 29: That statement was made that they’ve been delivering for years, 10- to 20,000 masks. Okay, it’s a New York hospital. Very — it’s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20, to 300,000? 10- to 20,000 masks to 300,000?
Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don’t see, from a practical standpoint, how that’s possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places — not to that extent; that was the highest number I’ve heard. That’s the highest number you’ve seen, I would imagine, right?
But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals. He knows the system better than anybody. And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn’t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York.
To be clear, in his public statement Pesicka did not speculate that the high demand for masks from the New York hospital in recent weeks was due to theft.
Later in the press conference, Trump doubled down on the speculation, saying that with such a large increase in demand for masks at one hospital, ""I think people should check that because there’s something going on, whether — it’s not — I don’t think it’s hoarding; I think it’s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out. Check it out.""
After the press conference, leading Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden dismissed Trump’s speculation as ""ridiculous and completely false.""
""Today’s conspiracy-mongering from our President is among the most reckless and ignorant moves he has made during this crisis, and there have been many,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Lives hang in the balance.""
Also after the press conference, the Trump campaign pointed to news reports from March 6 in which Cuomo asked the state police to investigate reports from health care professionals that ""there have been thefts of medical equipment and masks from hospitals, believe it or not. Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products.""
A CNBC story about Cuomo’s comments noted that the governor didn’t indicate how much supplies or equipment was missing.
The Trump campaign also pointed to comments from an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, who, according to Modern Healthcare, ""said her hospital has had thefts of respirator masks and other essential protective equipment in lobbies and other high-traffic areas.""
But there is no indication of the scale of these thefts, and no evidence that they are driving the spiking demand for masks and other protective equipment at hospitals dealing with a steep increase in patients infected with COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in early March it had only about 1% of the masks that would be needed in a severe pandemic. An HHS spokesperson told CNBC that the U.S. had 42 million N95 and surgical masks in the federal stockpile, and that the U.S. would need about 3.5 billion to handle a severe pandemic.
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, released a statement in response to Trump’s comments that Americans ""deserve better than their President suggesting that PPE is ‘going out the back door’ of New York hospitals.""
""New York’s healthcare workers are treating exploding numbers of COVID-19 patients around the clock – willingly and without complaint. My daughter, an ICU nurse at a New York City hospital, is one of them,"" Raske said. ""The only thing they ask for in return is adequate amounts of personal protective equipment. PPE is the single thing that separates them from being COVID-19 patients themselves.""
We reached out to a spokesman at Owens & Minor to find out what hospital Pesicka was referring to, but we did not get a response. We also did not get a response from NYC Health + Hospitals, which runs the city’s public hospitals, about whether any of its hospitals were using as many masks as Pesicka cited.
Dr. George L. Anesi, director of the Medical Critical Care Bioresponse Team at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, where he has been leading the efforts to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic, told us in an email that while he couldn’t comment on the appropriate use of masks at any particular hospital, ""during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is reasonable for any hospital in a high-risk region, of which there are now many in the US, to see its mask use increase by an order of magnitude.""
""Increased demand for and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, has occurred for a number of reasons,"" said Anesi. ""First, even before novel coronavirus arrived, the US was in the midst of an intense respiratory viral season,"" from various non-novel coronavirus strains and other viruses. ""Second, arrival of the novel coronavirus prompted the need for masks for the care of both patients with confirmed COVID-19 and, importantly, patients who might have COVID-19 but were awaiting evaluation or testing. With the exponential spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, essentially any patient with respiratory complaints has the potential to be infected, and requires the use of masks to protect staff, family members, and other patients.""
""In any situation of increased demand or inadequate supply, there is always going to be some diversion, including from hospitals and from the public purchasing equipment most needed by frontline healthcare workers,"" Anesi said. ""Appropriate use by healthcare workers in this rapidly expanding pandemic is the dominant force currently.""
Stockpiling Ventilators
In his public comments, Trump also questioned why thousands of ventilators sent by the federal government to New York were being held in storage, even as Cuomo pleads for more.
At a press conference on March 29, Trump said that with thousands of ventilators sitting in storage in New York, ""maybe they didn’t need them so badly.""
Trump, March 29: We sent thousands of [ventilators] to New York. They were put into a warehouse — a New York warehouse — that happened to be located, interestingly, in Edison, New Jersey. They were given to New York, and we then went to other places, also giving thousands of ventilators. The people in New York never distributed the generators. We said, ""Why didn’t you distribute them?"" Now, you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses. I knew they had them. So we said, ""Why didn’t you distribute them?"" I’m — I hope they’ve distributed them now. But maybe they didn’t need them so badly.
Trump echoed that point in his ""Fox & Friends"" interview the next morning.
Trump, March 30: And we delivered 4,000 ventilators to New York to their warehouse which happens to be located – which is interesting — in Edison, New Jersey. It was signed off, they were delivered, and they weren’t used. And we said a number of days later, ""Why aren’t you using these ventilators?"" I don’t know what happened, but we delivered thousands of them and we’ve delivered them to a lot of people. And, you know, there’s a whole question about that. I think New York should be fine, based on the numbers that we see, they should have more than enough. I mean, I’m hearing stories that they’re not used or they’re not used right.
Cuomo has acknowledged that there are thousands of ventilators being held in storage, but he said that doesn’t mean they aren’t needed, or that New York doesn’t need more. Cuomo said they are being stockpiled ahead of anticipated demand in a couple weeks.
In an interview on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe,"" Cuomo said the president’s comments indicate Trump doesn’t understand ""how to run a government, how to plan an operation.""
""This virus has been ahead of us from day one,"" Cuomo said. ""We’ve been playing catch-up from day one. Still two, three, four weeks away depending on whose projection model you use. Prepare for the apex. Have the materials for the apex. That’s when the system is going to collapse. They sent 4,000 ventilators. I’m not using them today because I don’t need them today. I need to assemble them in a stockpile. A stockpile, by definition, is to be used at the high point.""
Cuomo has said that based on projections from medical experts, New York is expected to need as many as 30,000 ventilators ""at that high point of need.""
""That’s what the numerical projections say,"" Cuomo said on March 28. ""So we’re planning for that quote, unquote worst case scenario which the models predict. Maybe we never get there, maybe we flatten the curve and we slow the infection rate so we never get to that point and that’s what we’re trying to do and we’re working on that day and night. But, if we can’t flatten the curve, you can’t slow the infection rate, you hit that apex, make sure you’re ready for the apex and that’s where the 30,000 ventilators come in.""
In an interview on MSNBC’s ""All In with Chris Hayes"" on March 27, Cuomo said the data comes from a variety of sources, including the state health department.
""So what I do is I just study the numbers and the science and the data and I follow the data,"" Cuomo said. ""We have McKinsey & Company [a global management consulting firm], we have and Weill-Cornell medical center [the biomedical research unit and medical school of Cornell University], I talked to the World Health Organization, look at the models of China, look at the models of South Korea, look at the models of Italy and look at the models of the numbers in my state.""
In his March 30 interview on ""Morning Joe,"" Cuomo said, ""The tsunami is coming.""
""We know it is,"" he said. ""Now is the time to gather supplies, do the preparations because it’s too late the day before. If you have not done the work before the storm hits, it’s too late to do it once the storm hits. And the storm is coming. Stop the politics. Listen to the scientists and the pros and plan because otherwise … people will die who don’t need to die. That’s the bottom line. … The storm hits in two weeks, three weeks, this is what I’m going to need. If you don’t want to see a total collapse. And let’s focus on getting that.""

		Quick Take
A viral video questions the safety of face masks by using a gas detector to purportedly show that masks result in dangerous oxygen levels for the wearer. But experts — and the company that makes the gas detector — say the video’s test is scientifically flawed.


Full Story 
In a popular video swirling on Facebook, a local official in Pennsylvania casts doubt on the safety of face masks by arguing that a test he performs on camera shows that masks prevent people from breathing ""the required oxygen level.""
But the viral video’s test is scientifically flawed and its conclusions wrong, according to multiple experts.
The video by Jeff Neff — a firefighter and president of the borough council in Sewickley, Pennsylvania — was uploaded June 27 and has racked up more than 11,000 shares and more than 260,000 views. It’s one of many recent dubious claims about face masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends be used to help limit the spread of COVID-19.
The CDC advises the general public to use cloth masks in public settings, especially when it is hard to maintain physical distancing. Experts, including those at the American Lung Association, have said masks do not cause low oxygen levels.
Neff, who unsuccessfully ran in the Republican primary in the state’s 37th senatorial district in June, begins with some correct statements about normal oxygen levels in air and federal workplace safety rules. The air is comprised of 21% oxygen, according to NASA, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, defines an ""oxygen deficient atmosphere"" — and therefore dangerous to life or health — as one in which oxygen falls below 19.5% by volume.
The central claims that follow, however, rest on an unsound test.
In the video, Neff uses a device for detecting gas levels to suggest that four different face masks deprive wearers of appropriate oxygen level intakes because the detector readings drop below 19.5% for oxygen. He concludes: ""No matter what you choose — head sock, neoprene type fancy mask, cheap mask, N95, the best available — none of them allow you to breathe in the required oxygen level, which should be close to 21%.""
Experts we contacted disputed his methodology and findings.
""He’s really misinformed and ill-qualified"" to be conducting such a test, said Thomas Fuller, an associate professor of health sciences at Illinois State University and member of the American Industrial Hygiene Association, who reviewed the video for FactCheck.org.
Fuller, a certified industrial hygienist, said the main issue with Neff’s test is that the meter, placed underneath the various masks, is picking up Neff’s own exhaled breath — which contains about 16% oxygen and includes other gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. ""What he’s measuring is what he’s breathing out — it’s the gases that are taking up the concentration in that enclosed space,"" Fuller said.
Fuller said oxygen molecules are small enough to pass through such masks when the wearer inhales.

 
MSA Safety, the manufacturer of the device used by Neff — an ALTAIR 5X Multigas Detector — also told us that there are issues with using the device for such a test.
""Although the ALTAIR 5X detects the ambient levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide and other gases, it is not designed for the use shown,"" Samantha D’Uva, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an email. ""It is a portable gas detector designed for applications where there is a need to detect potentially hazardous or combustible atmospheres in factories, rooms, work areas, and confined spaces much larger than the area inside a face covering.""
D’Uva continued: ""When used to sample the air behind a face mask, the wearer’s exhaled breath would displace oxygen and subsequently put the ALTAIR 5X into oxygen alarm. The same thing would happen if you simply exhaled into the sample line. Due to the response and recovery time of the oxygen sensor, combined with the small space inside of the mask, the readings would not have time to reset before the next exhalation, resulting in a continuous alarm.""
Kirsten Koehler, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, offered similar observations based on her viewing of the video.
""Exhaled breath is only about 16% oxygen,"" she said in an email. ""When you exhale in the mask, some small volume of air will be left in the mask (in the small space between the mask and your face) with this lower concentration at the end of an exhalation. As you inhale, that air is rapidly replaced with fresh air from the room filling your lungs (a much larger volume) with air at normal oxygen conditions.""
""The sensor is trying to respond to these rapidly changing conditions,"" Koehler added. ""However, sensors cannot respond instantaneously to changes in concentration. It might take them, say 10 seconds to respond to a change in concentration, but your breathing rate is faster than that. So likely what is happening is that the sensor ends up with an intermediate value of 17-18%-ish that you typically see on his meter. You can also tell that the sensors don’t immediately respond to the change in concentration because they keep alarming after he takes the tube out of the mask.""
Koehler said such sensors can also have ""sharp responses to rapid changes"" in temperature and humidity — which could also affect the readings.
In a phone interview, Neff said he stood by his experiment and that he is planning to post another video that shows the detector doesn’t clear even when he holds his breath while wearing a mask.
""I’ve had multiple people contact me — from doctors to gas detector companies all contact me and say, I believe what your results are,"" Neff said.
Neff said he had nothing to gain by doing the video and that he did it to test what another online video had claimed. (Similar claims involving gas detectors have been pushed in other viral videos, including one debunked by the fact-checking website Lead Stories.)
Fuller said it’s true that ""people will notice they have to use more force to breathe in and out when they put [masks] on"" and said people with asthma or other conditions could struggle with wearing masks. (The CDC makes note of this, too).


""It’s the resistance of pulling [the air] through the fiber that makes it harder,"" Fuller said. ""The air you’re pulling in has the same amount of oxygen.""
N95 respirators — tight-fitting masks that create a seal on the face and include a specialized filter that captures at least 95% of the airborne particles that pass through it — in particular can make it harder to breathe. The Food and Drug Administration notes that ""people with chronic respiratory, cardiac, or other medical conditions that make breathing difficult should check with their health care provider before using an N95 respirator because the N95 respirator can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe.""
That said, federal health officials do not recommend N95s be worn by the general public; they advise the respirators be reserved for health care professionals and first responders.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Labor, of which OSHA is a part, said OSHA hasn’t made any determination on face masks and oxygen levels and declined to comment on the video.
OSHA’s website says the agency ""generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work. Face coverings are intended to prevent wearers who have Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) without knowing it (i.e., those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) from spreading potentially infectious respiratory droplets to others. This is known as source control.""
The agency advises employers to consider health and safety factors of masks for employees in cases such as performing laborious tasks, working with chemicals and wearing masks for long periods, the spokesperson said — also noting that cloth masks are not considered a replacement for personal protective equipment.

		Q: Did a recent study in Denmark show that face masks are useless for COVID-19?
A: No. The study found that face masks did not have a large protective effect for wearers — not that masks provide no protection at all or don’t offer benefits to others. 

FULL QUESTION
Are masks proven to be useless for COVID-19?
FULL ANSWER
News of the results of a recent randomized controlled trial in Denmark testing a face mask intervention has led some to conclude that masks are ineffective against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. 
But scientists say that’s the wrong takeaway — and even the authors of the study say the results shouldn’t be interpreted to mean masks shouldn’t be worn.
The trial evaluated whether giving free surgical masks to volunteers and recommending their use safeguarded wearers from infection with the coronavirus, in addition to other public health recommendations. The study didn’t identify a statistically significant protective effect for wearers, but the trial was only designed to detect a large effect of 50% or more. And the study didn’t weigh in on the ability of masks to prevent spread of the virus from wearers to others, or what’s known as source control, which is thought to be the primary way that masks work.
As a result, the most that can be said is that this particular study, under the conditions at the time in Denmark, didn’t find that the face mask intervention had a large protective effect for wearers — not that masks provide no protection at all or don’t offer benefits to others. 
Social media posts nevertheless latched onto the study to claim that the trial ""proves masks offer NO protection from COVID"" or that masks ""don’t work,"" as several posts claimed. Another post inaccurately described the results as ""conclusive,"" despite the fact that the authors specifically wrote that their findings were ""inconclusive.""
Other articles shared on Facebook failed to provide sufficient context for the study, with one headline from the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity reading, ""Your Face Mask Is Not Protecting You."" Yet another from Sharyl Attkisson, who has previously spread misinformation about vaccines, misleadingly states that there was ""no statistically significant difference when it comes to wearing a mask or not outside the home to prevent Covid-19 spread.""
Again, the study only assessed the personal protective effect of a mask intervention, not the potential for masks to hamper spread of the virus to others.
The Danish trial, known as the Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection, or DANMASK-19, was published in Annals of Internal Medicine on Nov. 18 along with two editorials to provide more context to the findings.
It’s the first randomized controlled trial involving face masks and COVID-19 to report results. Around 6,000 people who left their homes for at least three hours a day participated, with approximately half being given a box of 50 surgical masks and being told to wear a mask whenever outside of their homes, while the other half was not given masks or such a mask recommendation.
The study was conducted at a time when Danish authorities were not recommending masks to the general public, so most people both groups would encounter were not likely to be masked. Both groups were told to follow national public health guidance, which included physical distancing, avoiding crowds and washing hands.
After a month, 42 people in the mask group, or 1.8%, had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, as measured by at-home finger-prick antibody tests, a positive PCR test result or a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with 53 people, or 2.1%, in the control group.
While fewer people in the masked group became infected — equivalent to an 18% reduction in risk — the difference was not statistically significant, meaning the result may have come about by chance. Given the observed number of infections in each group, the plausible effect of the mask intervention ranged all the way from a 46% decrease in infection to a 23% increase.
It’s this negative result that some have interpreted to mean that masks are ineffective. But that’s not how the authors frame their findings.
Bundgaard, et al.: Our results suggest that the recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among others did not reduce, at conventional levels of statistical significance, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mask wearers in a setting where social distancing and other public health measures were in effect, mask recommendations were not among those measures, and community use of masks was uncommon. Yet, the findings were inconclusive and cannot definitively exclude a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection of mask wearers in such a setting. It is important to emphasize that this trial did not address the effects of masks as source control or as protection in settings where social distancing and other public health measures are not in effect.
Elsewhere, the authors noted that the data were ""compatible"" with a less than 50% degree of self-protection and emphasized that their results ""should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.""
University of Hong Kong infectious disease epidemiologist and mask researcher Benjamin Cowling told us he was not surprised by the findings and said it was important to distinguish between an absence of evidence and evidence of absence on the utility of masks.
""In the Danish mask study, their results are consistent with maybe 20% protection conferred by face masks, which is in line with my estimates for influenza,"" he said in an email. 
""While some readers seem to conclude from the Danish study that masks are not effective, I would only conclude from the Danish study that masks are not /highly effective/, which we already suspected,"" he continued, adding that it does not mean that masks are ineffective. ""Even 20% protection would be very valuable when we are trying very hard to slow down COVID transmission as much as we can with a range of public health measures.""
The paper’s lead author, Dr. Henning Bundgaard of the specialty hospital Rigshospitalet and Copenhagen University Hospital, told Forbes much the same.
""Even a small degree of protection is worth using the face masks,"" he said, ""because you are protecting yourself against a potentially life-threatening disease.""
An accompanying editorial penned by the editor-in-chief of the journal and colleagues explained that while the study suggests that the personal protective effect of masks is ""likely to be small,"" the study ""does not disprove the effectiveness of widespread mask wearing.""
On the contrary, the editorial argues that together with the other existing data in support of masks, the ""results of this trial should motivate widespread mask wearing to protect our communities and thereby ourselves while we await more definitive evidence during this pandemic.""
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an updated scientific brief earlier this month that for the first time emphasized the ability of masks to protect wearers, based on lab studies that find masks can block virus particles and some observational and epidemiology studies.
The other editorial — by experts with the public health initiative Resolve to Save Lives, including former CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden — highlighted several limitations of the study.
For one, the trial was done in April and May when there was relatively little virus circulating in Denmark, which might have made it more difficult to pick up a protective effect of mask wearing.
Not everyone in the mask group followed through on the advice to wear a mask, either, with 46% of people self-reporting that they wore the masks ""as recommended""; 47% ""predominantly as recommended""; and 7% ""not as recommended.""
Most critically, Frieden and colleagues suggested that the antibody tests used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection could have led to a fair number of false positives, especially given the low prevalence of the coronavirus at the time. Even with those false positives evenly distributed between the two groups, that would have biased the result to be negative.
Other scientists at Stanford University and George Washington University previously expressed concern with the study design, including the fact that the study was not large enough to identify protective effects less than a 50% reduction in risk, and the likelihood that any results would be misinterpreted.
The takeaway about masks, then, is still quite similar to the earlier public health advice, which is that people should wear them, but not assume that they will be protected. That means continuing to follow all public health guidelines, including washing hands and staying physically apart from other people whenever possible.

      Unpacking WHO’s Asymptomatic COVID-19 Transmission Comments

		At a June 8 press conference, a World Health Organization scientist confusingly suggested that asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus is ""very rare"" — a statement that many scientists found problematic, and which some politicians and those on social media seized upon as evidence that certain public health measures were not necessary.
It is well documented that people without symptoms can transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it is not yet known how often that happens, or how frequently that involves someone who is completely asymptomatic.
Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist and the WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead who was responsible for the remarks, clarified the next day that the amount of transmission from people who are asymptomatic is a ""a big open question."" She said her original comment applied to only a subset of studies and data from member states, and pertained only to those who are truly asymptomatic.
""We do know that some people who are asymptomatic, or some people who don’t have symptoms, can transmit the virus on,"" she said in a live online Q&A event. ""What I was referring to yesterday in the press conference were a very few studies, some two or three studies, that have been published that actually try to follow asymptomatic cases.""
While we are not privy to the member state data, Van Kerkhove is mostly right that the few epidemiology studies that exist have found little onward transmission from truly asymptomatic people, although she may have exaggerated. One study that the WHO cited in its mask guidance identified no secondary transmission from asymptomatic cases, but another identified spread from nine people, or 14% of asymptomatic cases.
Dr. Oyuka Byambasuren, a researcher at Bond University’s Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare in Australia who co-authored a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing asymptomatic transmission, told us that based on the available data, WHO was correct to state that asymptomatic transmission is low, but that the term ""very rare"" was ""probably inappropriate.""
Van Kerkhove’s initial summary also failed to include modeling studies that have found significantly higher contributions to transmission from people without symptoms, which she acknowledged.
Much of the core confusion, however, stems from semantics and the use of the term asymptomatic, which in scientific circles typically means a person who never has any symptoms throughout the disease course. That’s in contrast to someone who is pre-symptomatic, and goes on to develop symptoms later, and to those who have only very mild symptoms.
Right now, there’s substantial evidence that people without symptoms can spread the disease, which is why public health officials are encouraging the use of face masks and social distancing, along with other pandemic prevention efforts.
But exactly how much spread is from pre-symptomatic people versus those who never develop any symptoms whatsoever is less clear.
As Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, told us, there’s ""pretty good data"" showing that pre-symptomatic people are responsible for some transmission of COVID-19. But there’s less information about people who stay symptom-free.
""We don’t actually know, to date, the degree to which people who have no symptoms ever — throughout the time they have this virus — to what extent they’re responsible for driving this pandemic,"" he said.
This wrinkle may have been what Van Kerkhove was trying to discuss, but the message many people heard was that the virus doesn’t spread when people don’t have symptoms.
One Facebook meme falsely claimed that the WHO was ""now saying they were wrong"" and that ""it seems like the ‘conspiracy theorist’ were right again."" The post went on to say, ""This was never about a deadly virus,"" and that the WHO meant that an ""asymptomatic person cannot transfer the virus.""
That’s not true. Not only did Van Kerkhove not say that, but as WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted in a June 10 press conference, the agency has said since early February that ""asymptomatic people can transmit COVID-19, but that we need more research to establish the extent of asymptomatic transmission.""
Another post, which was a snapshot of a tweet from the conservative commentator Liz Wheeler, pointed to lockdowns and business closures for healthy people, saying, ""The WHO now says asymptomatic transmission is rare. We’ve been duped. Again.""
Some Republican politicians also jumped on the news. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio declared, ""Reopen America!"" on Twitter while retweeting a CNBC story about the WHO’s comments.
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, sharing the same story, said in a tweet, ""Good News!  People who catch coronovirus but have no symptoms rarely spread the disease.  Translation:  sending kids back to school does not require millions of test kits.""
The CNBC story was subsequently updated, and another story explaining the WHO’s clarification was published the morning of June 9. The article appeared after Paul’s tweet, but minutes before Jordan’s sharing of the first article. Neither politician shared news of the WHO’s clarification about the matter.
We’ll review what the WHO said, the evidence on asymptomatic transmission and why the issue has become so muddled.
What WHO Said
Van Kerkhove’s first comments came at the end of the WHO’s June 8 press conference, when a Reuters reporter asked about asymptomatic spread, given reports in Singapore that at least half of new cases were without symptoms.  
Van Kerkhove started by noting that in many countries, when COVID-19 cases have been contact traced, many of the seemingly asymptomatic cases were not completely without symptoms, but rather, had very mild symptoms.
""They may not have developed fever yet, they may not have had a significant cough, or they may not have shortness of breath,"" she said, acknowledging that there were some people who were truly asymptomatic as well. 
She then turned to the question of how many asymptomatic people transmit the virus, saying that that assessment requires careful monitoring of individuals to look for secondary transfer.
""We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They’re following asymptomatic cases, they’re following contacts, and they’re not finding secondary transmission onward,"" Van Kerkhove said. ""It’s very rare.""
She added that much of that evidence is not published, and pointed to a few other published studies. 
""We are constantly looking at this data and we’re trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question,"" she said. ""It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward.""
Van Kerkhove then said during a social media Q&A on June 9 that she wanted to make ""some clarifications"" to address ""perhaps some of the misunderstandings"" from what she said the day before.
Her first point was that it’s not clear how many people are truly asymptomatic, with some estimates ranging from 6% to 41% of the infected population.
""We know that people who are infected with COVID-19, many develop symptoms. But there are some people who do not,"" she said. ""And to truly understand how many people don’t have symptoms, we don’t actually have that answer yet.""
On transmission from asymptomatic people, and her statement the day prior, Van Kerkhove said she was referring to ""some two or three studies"" along with information from member states.
""I was responding to a question at the press conference, I wasn’t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that, I was just trying to articulate what we know,"" she said. ""And in that, I used the phrase ‘very rare,’ and I think that that’s [a] misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic spread globally is very rare.""
Calling the amount of asymptomatic transmission a ""major unknown,"" she also said that she had neglected to mention modeling studies which have arrived at much higher estimates of transmission from people without symptoms.
""There’s a big range from the different models, depending on how the models are done,"" she said. ""But some estimates of around 40% of transmission may be due to asymptomatic [spread]. But those are from models. And so I didn’t include that in my answer yesterday, but wanted to make sure I covered that here.""
Unclear Definitions
Some scientists considered Van Kerkhove’s first remarks a misunderstanding, while others were more critical.
""I think that that comment was taken out of context and misunderstood,"" Peter Hotez, the dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University, told us. ""If you’re communicating a lot, eventually you’ll have missteps.""
The Harvard Global Health Institute issued a statement over email saying that the WHO ""created confusion,"" and that ""[a]ll of the best evidence suggests that people without symptoms can and do readily spread SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19."" 
""In fact, some evidence suggest[s] that people may be most infectious in the days before they become symptomatic — that is, in the pre-symptomatic phase when they feel well, have no symptoms, but may be shedding substantial amounts of virus,"" the statement continued.
Bogoch called her comments a ""mistake,"" noting that the WHO is under a lot of pressure, but that it has to get its communication right. ""It was a bit of an oversimplification, and required clarification and some correction,"" he told us.
But Bogoch also said that the scientific community had not been diligent in differentiating between the mildly symptomatic, the pre-symptomatic and the completely asymptomatic.
""From the very beginning, the studies that have been published have not really been entirely clear on distinguishing between these groups,"" he said. ""And it’s done us a tremendous disservice."" 
He pointed to several high-profile studies that on the surface seem to suggest that a relatively high number COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic, but which are not able to fully make those claims because of incomplete reporting.
For example, one study in Iceland, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April, observed that 43% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 did not have symptoms at the time, but it did not follow-up with participants to see if they developed symptoms later.
Another widely cited but unpublished paper from Vo, Italy, which found that around 40% of cases were asymptomatic, Bogoch said, was problematic because the authors limited the symptoms to fever and cough.
""We know that’s not fair,"" he said. ""There are a lot of other symptoms for COVID-19, and fever and cough are not sufficient.""
""Most studies, or most data that are reported, are from people tested at a single time point. So they are a mix of people who will develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) if followed for long enough and those who will remain asymptomatic,"" explained Dr. Nicola Low, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.
Low is a co-author of a systematic review and meta-analysis posted to the preprint server medRxiv synthesizing the available information about asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Based on 28 studies with adequate follow-up, she said, she estimates that about 15% of people remain asymptomatic throughout infection.
A separate systematic review and meta-analysis, posted to medRxiv and cited by the WHO in its mask guidance, came up with the same percentage for asymptomatic cases.
Bond University’s Byambasuren, who led the review, told us that the results were based on nine ""good studies,"" and that the team only included ""studies with a valid sampling process and followed people for at least 7 days after their initial positive test"" to tease out the asymptomatic cases from the pre-symptomatic ones.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, has pegged the approximate number of asymptomatic cases, based on data as of the end of April, at 35%.
Evaluating how frequently people who are truly asymptomatic pass on the virus is even trickier than pinning down the percentage of asymptomatic cases.
The minimal data that does exist, Bogoch said, does point to relatively uncommon transmission.
A small study of an outbreak in a South Korean call center, for example, found four asymptomatic cases out of 97 infections, and none of those people’s household contacts acquired secondary infections.
A contact tracing investigation in Taiwan also found no transmission from nine asymptomatic patients to 91 close contacts. 
But, Bogoch said, those glimmers of evidence aren’t enough to really come to a conclusion about asymptomatic spread. ""It’s not entirely clear if it’s very rare just yet,"" he said.
In her review, Byambasuren included four studies — the two previously mentioned ones plus two others —  with estimates of asymptomatic transmission that could be compared with symptomatic transmission. For those few studies, the asymptomatic transmission rate ranged from 0% to 2.2%, while the symptomatic transmission rate ranged from 0.8% to 15.4%.
""From our research we estimate that asymptomatic people transmit about 40% less than symptomatic people,"" she said, noting that could be because those people are infectious for a shorter period of time and because they produce fewer infectious respiratory droplets because they’re not coughing or sneezing. ""Unfortunately, based on the available data we cannot rule out that both cases could transmit equally.""
Low said that rigorously determining how often asymptomatic people transmit the virus in a study is incredibly hard to do, so the alternative is to look at mathematical models of transmission.
""They generally find that 40-60% of all transmission comes from people who didn’t have symptoms at the time,"" she said.
Separately from her other analysis of the proportion of asymptomatic cases, Low assessed four modeling studies, three of which evaluated pre-symptomatic transmission only. According to her review, the fourth study, published in the journal Science by researchers in the U.K., found that asymptomatic transmission was responsible for 6% of transmission while pre-symptomatic transmission contributed 47%.
Some experts nevertheless cautioned against making too much of modeling studies.
""You’ve got to model data,"" Bogoch said. ""And every model’s going to have assumptions.""
""We need actual data rather than modeling studies,"" Byambasuren said.
Policy Implications
Multiple experts told us that while the debate over asymptomatic transmission may appear to be an academic exercise, it’s one that ultimately matters.
""Contact tracing and testing relies on most people becoming symptomatic so they can be isolated and their contacts – symptomatic or not – be quarantined,"" said Byambasuren. ""Pre-symptomatic cases make this slower, but can still be detected; whereas fully asymptomatic cases make it much harder – and rely on being captured by the contact tracing of symptomatic cases.""
Accordingly, if more asymptomatic spread is happening than previously thought, more testing might be necessary to contain the virus.
Bogoch said that it could be a major boon to public health if it turns out that many of the people who are thought to be asymptomatic are actually mildly symptomatic or exhibit more unusual COVID-19 symptoms. If the public could be better educated about that, more people could be caught earlier in infection and their contacts could be traced, limiting community spread.
Still, even if true asymptomatic spread is rare — which is still up for debate — scientists said the takeaway should not be that people can abandon precautionary measures.
""There is evidence that people can transmit to others before they develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic period),"" explained University of Florida biostatistician Natalie Dean in a Twitter thread. ""This means that people without current symptoms can be infectious.""
And despite the confusion, Van Kerkhove noted at the end of her social media Q&A that the uncertainty about coronavirus transmission — including the amount stemming from any type of person who lacks symptoms — is why physical distancing, hand washing, wearing face masks and following stay-at-home orders is so important. ""That’s why all of that is really, really critical,"" she said.

      Doctors in Video Falsely Equate COVID-19 With a ‘Normal Flu Virus’

		Quick Take
A video posted by a European-based group called World Doctors Alliance falsely claims the novel coronavirus is ""a normal flu virus"" and there is no COVID-19 pandemic. Actually, COVID-19 is deadlier than the seasonal flu, and some European nations are combatting a second wave of cases.

Full Story
According to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we remain in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, with an uptick in case numbers and hospitalizations straining the ability of medical centers in some areas to cope. Some European governments have imposed more restrictions to fight another wave of cases.
Yet on Oct. 10, Heiko Schöning, a German physician and head of a group known by the German acronym ACU2020, announced formation of an organization called World Doctors Alliance to challenge the veracity of the COVID-19 pandemic. The alliance website claims it is ""abundantly clear that the ‘pandemic’ is basically over and has been since June 2020.""
An 18-minute video announcing the group’s formation was posted on the ACU2020 website but has since been taken down by YouTube for violating its terms of service. Still, portions of the video featuring two doctors challenging the science behind the pandemic are circulating on Facebook with false assertions and statistics.
Staking out the group’s position, Elke De Klerk, a Dutch general practitioner, says on the video, ""We do not have a pandemic"" and calls COVID-19 a ""normal flu virus"" – claims flatly rejected by the WHO, CDC, and other experts.
De Klerk claims the pandemic designation was based on poor testing, with the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, molecular test returning false positive results in ""89 to 94%"" of the cases. That’s not true.
While the false positive rate remains an area of continued examination, preliminary studies show the test’s false positive rate is far less than De Klerk claims. A recent article in the British medical publication The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, said estimates in the U.K. place the false positive rate in the 0.8 to 4% range, while false negatives could run as high as 33%.
As for the virus that causes COVID-19, scientists universally agree it is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, not a strain of influenza.
While the death rate for COVID-19 remains uncertain, as we have reported, evidence suggests it is higher than for seasonal influenza.
In De Klerk’s own country, the Netherlands, there have been more than 6,800 deaths attributed to COVID-19 so far this year, compared to 2,900 due to flu and pneumonia in 2018-19.
In the U.S., where COVID-19 has caused more than 220,000 deaths, the worst flu season in the past decade killed an estimated 61,000 people in 2017-18, as we’ve reported. In fact, COVID-19 so far has killed more people in the U.S. than the past five flu seasons combined, and hundreds more die each day.  
In addition, a CDC study released Oct. 20 found hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration had a five times higher risk of death than patients with the flu.
The other speaker in the video circulating on Facebook is Dolores Cahill, a professor at the medical school at the University College Dublin in Ireland. Cahill, who has become something of a lightning rod as a COVID-19 denier, claims on the video that there have only been 98 deaths in Ireland due to the coronavirus since April.
But according to Ireland’s Central Statistics Office, more than 1,800 people have died of COVID-19 in the country, all but 200 since April.
And with cases on an upswing, the Irish government announced Oct. 19 that it was imposing tough new restrictions to slow the spread of the disease. The measures, which will last until at least Dec. 1, require all non-essential retail businesses, barbers, hairdressers, and salons to close and ban gatherings in homes. Restaurants and pubs will be limited to takeout and delivery service.
Cahill has found herself under fire from both her university, which issued a statement disassociating itself from her views, and the European Union, which asked her to resign from an EU medical panel.

      Trump Ad’s Misleading Use of CNN Interview

		A Trump campaign ad misleadingly edits a CNN interview to suggest 2 million people would have died from the novel coronavirus were it not for President Donald Trump’s China travel restrictions.
In the one-minute ad, Wolf Blitzer, anchor of CNN’s ""The Situation Room,"" is heard asking chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, ""Is it accurate that if these steps had not been put in place … it could’ve been 2 million people dead here in the United States?"" While Blitzer speaks, the ad shows images of an Air China plane and signs saying airline flights had been canceled. ""Yes,"" Gupta is shown saying.
The impression is that Trump’s travel restrictions, which went into effect Feb. 2, were responsible for saving those lives.
But the ad edited Blitzer’s question in a misleading way. In fact, during the March 30 interview, Blitzer asked, ""Well, is it accurate that if these steps had not been put in place, the stay at home orders, the social distancing orders, as the president said yesterday, it could have been 2 million people dead here in the United States?"" The ad gives no hint that the question was about social distancing, not travel restrictions.
And while Gupta ultimately gave a positive response to Blitzer’s question, it is much more nuanced than the ad suggests. Gupta answered, ""I mean, you know, these are all models, Wolf. It’s a little tough to say, but, you know, if you talk about something that is spreading, you know, very robustly throughout a community. You know, two to three times more contagious than flu, and up to 10 times, perhaps even more than that, more deadly than flu, then yes. I mean, that’s when you start to get those sorts of numbers. I mean, you know, this is a pathogen that obviously is, can cause a lot of disease and death.""

A lawyer for WarnerMedia, CNN’s parent company, wrote a letter to the Trump campaign asking it to ""cease and desist"" from airing the ad.
""The advertisement purposely and deceptively edits the clip to imply that Mr. Blitzer and Dr. Gupta were crediting the President’s travel ban policy issued in January for saving millions of American lives, when in fact Mr. Blitzer and Dr. Gupta were discussing recently implemented social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders issued by state and local governments,"" said the letter written by WarnerMedia Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel Rick McMurtry. ""Such misuse of CNN content is false, misleading and deceptive.""
The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh has defended the ad. He told CNN, ""No discussion of efforts to prevent American deaths from the coronavirus can be had without the understanding that President Trump restricted travel from China in January. Based on that alone, the ad is accurate.""
The novel coronavirus pandemic began in Wuhan, China, late last year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the China travel restrictions on Jan. 31. Trump has frequently referred to the action as a ""travel ban,"" but as we have written, that is a misnomer.
The policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. But the rules don’t apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members. And they don’t bar importing goods from China.
A New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect.
Without evidence, in at least two briefings, the president claimed that his travel restrictions ""saved tens of thousands"" and even ""hundreds of thousands of lives."" We found no support for such figures, and the White House didn’t provide any.
The few studies that have been done suggest that travel restrictions several countries enacted slowed the initial spread outside of China but did not contain the virus. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
The ad, titled ""American Comeback,"" also repeats an inaccurate claim on the U.S. economy that Trump has made many times before.
In the ad, Trump says, ""We built the greatest economy the world has ever seen, and we’re going to do it again."" This echoes a line Trump used at least 11 times at coronavirus briefings in April: that America had ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before the coronavirus pandemic.  
The economy was in good shape before the coronavirus outbreak, with stocks soaring and unemployment low. But it was by no means the greatest economy in history. As we have written, the economy has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 2.9% 19 times. 
The ad features two Democratic governors praising federal efforts to help the states during the coronavirus pandemic.
In one clip, the ad shows New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying, ""What the federal government did was a phenomenal accomplishment."" The clip was edited from the original statement, which came during an April 19 press conference: ""Look, what the federal government did working with states, as I just said, was a phenomenal accomplishment."" Cuomo did praise the federal government, along with others, in working to help flatten the curve.
""The federal government stepped up and was a great partner and I’m the first one to say it. We needed help and they were there,"" Cuomo went on to say. ""State and local governments were fantastic. The hospital system was fantastic. New Yorkers were fantastic. And that is an undeniable fact.""
In another, California Gov. Gavin Newsom says, ""Promise made, promise kept."" Newsom made that comment in connection with a shipment the federal government had sent California of 90,000 testing swabs, which Trump had promised in a conversation with Newsom.
Cuomo and Trump, who both come from Queens, have had an up and down relationship during the pandemic. Newsom, formerly a Trump critic, has said many positive things about the president of late. Trump has stressed the importance to him of governors expressing appreciation for his help.
CNN said it learned about the ad on May 1 when it was submitted as part of a campaign ad buy. Television networks routinely review ads to make sure there is no problematic content. The Trump campaign said it is spending ""mid-seven figures"" on the ad, which is running nationally this week on broadcast and cable outlets. It debuted May 3 before Trump’s Fox News virtual town hall. So far, the campaign has spent nearly $500,000 on the ad, according to Advertising Analytics.
McMurtry’s letter said the cable news outlet contacted the Trump campaign’s ad agency, Harris Sikes Media, asking that the ad be corrected. ""CNN was willing to accept the advertisement if the misuse had been corrected,"" McMurtry wrote. ""Despite this notice, you refused to correct the advertisement and knowingly proceeded with distributing the advertisement as is with the misleading claim.""
To sum up, there is no doubt that the ad edited the exchange between Blitzer and Gupta in a way that was misleading.

		Summary
For the sixth year in a row President Donald Trump has proved he is in a class of his own when it comes to political mendacity. His claims again make up the majority of our top 10 list of the most egregious falsehoods.
And in 2020, two of Trump’s whoppers may well be the most outrageous and damaging of his political career: his false attacks on the integrity of the election and his downplaying of the coronavirus pandemic.
Democratic President-elect Joe Biden also earned spots in our lineup for false claims about Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 outbreak and for wrongly, and repeatedly, saying he was ""arrested"" while trying to visit Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
Bogus information on COVID-19 dominated the viral misinformation landscape for much of the year. Among the worst of the worst: the ""Plandemic"" video, which gathered many such falsehoods into a grand conspiracy theory.

False Claims of a ""Rigged"" Election. For months this year, Trump primed his supporters to believe false and baseless claims about voter fraud, repeating falsehoods about mail-in ballots and declaring shortly before the election, ""the only way we can lose, in my opinion, is massive fraud.""





In a Dec. 1 interview, Attorney General William Barr said: ""To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.""
Trump did lose — in an election federal, state and local officials overseeing the nation’s voting system called ""the most secure in American history."" Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr, who will leave his post before Christmas, stated that U.S. attorneys and the FBI ""have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.""
But Trump’s unrelenting barrage of falsehoods continued. He pushed the bogus conspiracy theory that Dominion Voting Systems switched ""thousands of votes"" from him to Biden and falsely claimed ""the votes in Dominion, they say, are counted in foreign countries."" They’re not. 
He claimed he ""won"" on election night, before millions of votes had been counted, and in a Nov. 4 early morning speech from the White House called for ""all voting to stop."" Trump falsely said Republican poll observers weren’t allowed to watch ballot counting in some states. (One of his lawyers admitted to a Pennsylvania judge, ""There’s a nonzero number of people in the room."") He wrongly claimed it was ""statistically impossible"" that he lost the presidential race even as Republicans had success in congressional races. And he further pushed suspicions by drawing false comparisons between Biden’s performance in swing states and that of the last two Democratic presidential nominees.
He and his campaign promoted a false claim that surveillance camera footage in Georgia captured election workers adding illegal ballots from suspicious ""suitcases."" Those were standard containers used to secure valid ballots, state officials said. 
Trump also lost many legal challenges, with strong criticism from judges. In Pennsylvania, Appeals Court Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, wrote that ""calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.""
Downplaying the Coronavirus. Trump made unfounded and false claims in downplaying and dismissing the coronavirus pandemic, which has now caused more than 300,000 deaths and more than 17 million cases in the United States.




Trump, at a Feb. 10 rally in New Hampshire, said: ""It looks like by April, you know in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away — I hope that’s true. … But I think it’s going to work out good. We only have 11 cases, and they’re all getting better.""
In February, Trump suggested the coronavirus would ""go away"" in April, as temperatures warmed. By May, when that didn’t happen, he baselessly said the virus ""is going to go away without a vaccine."" Experts said that was unlikely. When Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned of a difficult winter ahead, Trump said ""corona could be just some little flare-ups that we’ll take care of.  We’re going to knock it out."" Daily cases and deaths have surged in December, hitting new highs.

We learned in September that Trump had told journalist Bob Woodward on March 19 that he was understating the threat on purpose. ""I wanted to always play it down,"" Trump said, adding, ""I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.""
One way Trump downplayed it was in comparing COVID-19 to the flu, despite telling Woodward in February that this virus was ""more deadly"" than ""even your strenuous flus.""
Even after contracting COVID-19 in October, Trump wrongly said that ""sometimes over 100,000"" people die from flu each year. The highest estimated death toll from flu in the past decade was 61,000 deaths in 2017-2018; the yearly average has been fewer than 40,000 lives. 
Trump also amplified false and baseless claims about the number of deaths due to the virus. In an October campaign rally, he questioned the reported numbers by making the unfounded claim of an ""incentive"" causing an increase in cases and deaths, because ""doctors get more money and hospitals get more money."" He pushed the false claim that the CDC had drastically reduced the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19. He continually equivocated on the wisdom of public mask-wearing, and continued to hold crowded campaign rallies where few wore masks.
Wrong on Ventilators and the Stockpile. Trump repeatedly made the false claim that he inherited a Strategic National Stockpile with ""empty"" or ""bare"" cupboards and that ""we weren’t left ventilators by a previous administration."" In fact, we learned in June from the Department of Health and Human Services that the federal government had more ventilators in stock, left from previous administrations, than it had distributed during the pandemic.
The Strategic National Stockpile had 16,660 ventilators, none bought by the Trump administration, when it began distributing the machines in March. On June 17, an HHS spokesperson said the government had distributed 10,640 ventilators up to that point during the coronavirus outbreak.
As for other medical supplies in the stockpile, the government doesn’t publicly report on the contents, but the repository, before Trump took office, reportedly contained vast amounts of materials, including vaccines against bioterrorism agents like smallpox, antivirals in case of a deadly flu pandemic, and protective gear for doctors and nurses.
Wrong on Hydroxychloroquine. In March, Trump began pushing hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, saying he had ""seen things that are impressive,"" even as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that a large clinical trial was needed to prove the drug’s effectiveness.
Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, can be used to treat malaria, as well as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The president went on to falsely claim ""people with lupus"" who take hydroxychloroquine ""aren’t catching this horrible virus."" People with lupus had contracted COVID-19. He cited nonexistent ""studies,"" suggesting there were few COVID-19 cases in ""malaria countries"" because of the use of hydroxychloroquine. The drugs aren’t widely used for malaria in much of the world. 
After a large, randomized controlled trial failed to find any benefit for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in June. The agency concluded the drugs are ""unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,"" and that the ""known and potential benefits"" of the drugs ""no longer outweigh"" the risks. Other trials also did not find a benefit. 
Despite that, the president continued to support hydroxychloroquine, claiming in an August tweet that ""[m]any doctors and studies disagree"" with the FDA’s EUA revocation and sharing a viral video of a group of physicians falsely claiming that hydroxychloroquine is a ""cure"" for COVID-19.
False Criticism of Trump’s COVID-19 Response. In a CNN town hall, Biden made the absurd claim that if Trump ""had done his job from the beginning — all the people would still be alive,"" adding, ""just look at the data."" No research or data supports such a claim. At the time, there had been more than 197,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States.











At a CNN town hall in September, Biden claimed, ""And if president had done his job — had done his job from the beginning — all the people would still be alive.""
Biden didn’t elaborate on what actions he believed could have stopped all deaths. Even if the U.S. had implemented incredibly strict travel limitations very early on, the body of research shows that could have delayed the spread of the virus but not contained it.
In another town hall, Biden falsely said the Trump administration made ""no effort"" to get U.S. medical experts into China ""early on in this crisis."" He made a similar claim in the first presidential debate. The CDC did try to get experts into China one week after the country reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said he made the offer again in January himself and through the WHO. In mid-February, a WHO team, with two U.S. members, was allowed by Chinese authorities to visit Wuhan, where the outbreak began. 
Biden also falsely said in March, at a time when testing availability was limited in the United States, that the WHO offered the U.S. diagnostic testing kits but ""we refused them."" The U.S. never refused a WHO test kit, which is intended for lower-income nations. It’s standard for countries with the scientific know-how to create their own tests.
Biden’s False Claim on Mandela. In February, Biden claimed at least three times that when he was in Congress, he was ""arrested"" in South Africa while trying to see Nelson Mandela on Robben Island, where the future leader of the country had been imprisoned from 1964 to 1982. Biden later admitted he was actually ""stopped"" and briefly ""detained"" at the airport.
On CNN on Feb. 28, after the New York Times had written about Biden’s claim, he walked it back. Biden said upon landing in South Africa he refused to take the whites-only entrance, because he would have been separated from African American members of the congressional delegation. ""When I said arrested, I meant I was not able to — I was not able to move. Cops, Afrikaners, would not let me go with them. Made me stay where I was. I guess I wasn’t arrested, I was stopped,"" he said.
Not the ""Greatest Economy."" Trump and other administration and campaign officials repeated the false talking point that he made the U.S. economy the ""strongest"" and ""greatest"" in world history (before the coronavirus pandemic). As we wrote during the Republican National Convention — when speakers made versions of this claim every night — that’s nonsense. The U.S. economy has been better under other presidents, both in terms of jobs and economic growth. 
Trump’s best year in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product growth was a 3% increase in 2018. GDP growth has been higher 17 times over the last 39 years, including most recently under then-President Barack Obama in 2015. And job growth during Trump’s first three years — before the coronavirus outbreak — was slower than the three years before he took office. 
""Plandemic"" Misinformation. A 26-minute viral video, filled with false and misleading claims about the coronavirus, attracted hundreds of thousands of views on multiple platforms in May. It was largely an interview with a controversial former chronic fatigue researcher who has spoken at events aimed at discrediting vaccines. Titled ""Plandemic,"" the video spun together various bogus bits to push a grand conspiracy about the coronavirus pandemic. 
Several of the video’s falsehoods had circulated in other social media messages this year. ""Plandemic"" claimed, contrary to scientific research on the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, that the virus ""was manipulated"" in a laboratory and is not ""naturally occurring."" It falsely said flu vaccines contain coronaviruses (they don’t), and made the perplexing assertion that using face masks could lead to people infecting themselves with their own breath. 
It made the unsubstantiated, and later disproven claim, that hydroxychloroquine is ""the most effective medication to treat"" COVID-19, and it pushed the idea that ""flu vaccines increase the odds by 36% of getting COVID-19,"" citing a study that didn’t involve SARS-CoV-2.
A second installment, released in August, spewed more falsehoods, suggesting without proof that the coronavirus was man-made and intentionally released. 
Trump’s Conspiracy Theories. As he has done for years, the president pushed and amplified wild conspiracy theories, mostly through Twitter.










At an NBC News town hall, Trump defended his retweet of a baseless conspiracy theory, saying ""people can decide for themselves.""
A few weeks before the election, Trump retweeted a conspiracy theory baselessly suggesting that Biden had members of SEAL Team 6 killed to cover up a purportedly failed assassination of Osama bin Laden in 2011. When asked about his retweet by NBC News’ Savannah Guthrie, Trump claimed this was someone’s ""opinion,"" adding: ""I’ll put it out there, and people can decide for themselves.""
We found no corroboration supporting the theory’s outrageous claims.
In the same televised town hall with Guthrie, Trump declined to disavow QAnon, the widespread conspiracy theory movement that baselessly suggests Trump is dismantling an elite child sex trafficking ring involving high-profile Democrats. ""I know nothing about QAnon,"" Trump claimed. ""I do know they are very much against pedophilia.""
In May, Trump, once again, endorsed a debunked theory linking MSNBC host Joe Scarborough to the death of one of his staffers in 2001, when he was a Republican congressman. The medical examiner determined the death was an accidental fall caused by a heart problem. But Trump asked for a reopening of the case, saying, ""Did he get away with murder? Some people think so.""
Trump also vaguely claimed in an interview that Biden was controlled by ""people that you’ve never heard of. People that are in the dark shadows."" And in promoting hydroxychloroquine, the president retweeted a post that said the drug ""is being suppressed to keep deaths high so the economy can be shut down ahead of the election."" There’s no evidence for that; as we said, the evidence shows the drug isn’t effective for treating COVID-19.
Campaign Distortions. Trump and Biden distorted each other’s positions on some issues beyond recognition.
Biden falsely claimed Trump’s ""plan"" would ""bankrupt"" Social Security by 2023. A campaign TV ad claimed these ""planned cuts"" would cause ""benefits"" to end by then.
But Trump never proposed cutting benefits.
Biden was pointing to an analysis by the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary of ""hypothetical legislation"" that would eliminate the payroll tax that funds Social Security ""with no alternative source of revenue."" Biden and others had taken advantage of confusing statements Trump made about ""terminating the payroll tax."" But White House and Trump campaign officials said the president meant that he wanted to forgive a four-month payroll tax holiday he had authorized via executive action. Trump himself has said: ""[W]hen I win the election, I’m going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape or form hurting Social Security. That money is going to come from the general fund.""
If Congress agrees to that forgiveness, the money to make up for lost tax revenue could either come from Social Security’s trust funds or from general revenues.
As for Trump, he falsely claimed Biden’s tax plan would result in ""doubling and tripling your taxes"" and that Biden wants to raise taxes on ""everybody"" including ""middle income"" people.
Biden proposes increasing taxes on very high-income earners and corporations; the plan wouldn’t double or triple people’s taxes at any income level on average, according to several independent analyses. Experts told us there conceivably could be rare cases in which a taxpayer inheriting capital assets could see federal taxes double or triple, but on average even the top 1% of earners would see an increase of about 40%, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s less than half a doubling for the highest-earning 1%.
Biden has vowed he won’t raise federal income taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year, and independent tax analyses conclude that the net result of all Biden’s tax proposals would be, on average, an increase in after-tax income (in effect, a tax cut) for the bottom 80% of households.
Trump also distorted a task force document released by allies of Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders to make several false claims about Biden’s positions on immigration.
The task force document called for closing for-profit detention centers, but Trump wrongly said it recommended ""no more detention"" for immigrants who enter the country illegally. It recommended expanding the asylum system, but Trump falsely said it would give asylum to ""all new illegal aliens."" The report called for a focus on prosecuting ""human traffickers, smugglers"" and other serious criminals, but Trump falsely said it would end prosecutions of illegal border-crossers.

		President Donald Trump and coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said the United States had done more testing for COVID-19 infections in eight days than South Korea had done in eight weeks, but that ignores the fact that South Korea has a much smaller population. On a per-capita basis, the U.S. lags behind the Asian country, and other nations.
We also found the raw numbers show the U.S. testing totals for the eight-day period were still a bit lower, but close, to South Korea’s eight-week figures.
In addition, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. test is ""better"" or ""the best test,"" but there is no evidence to support that.
South Korea and the Importance of Testing
South Korea has been held up as a relative success story in containing the coronavirus outbreak, due in part to an extensive, and early, testing program. The daily growth in new cases dropped off considerably in early March after spiking in late February. In other words, South Korea, so far, appears to have begun flattening the curve, which is the much-talked-about goal of social distancing efforts in the United States.
Both countries reported their first confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the same time, on Jan. 20 and 21. But South Korea ramped up its testing program sooner, and, therefore, was able to identify and isolate cases early in the pandemic. Testing a higher proportion of the population has given the country a greater capacity to control the total spread of the disease.
Around Feb. 19, South Korea first began reporting daily spikes in confirmed cases, while the U.S. was a few weeks behind that. The curve of confirmed cases for the U.S. is still on the rise, as the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine interactive tracking map of the worldwide outbreak shows.

As Science magazine wrote on March 17, while many countries, including several in Europe, had shown ""dire trends"" in rising case counts and deaths from COVID-19, ""South Korea has emerged as a sign of hope and a model to emulate."" The country has received praise for its testing program, while the U.S. government has faced criticism for a slow testing rollout and a lack of sufficient numbers of test kits.
(South Korea also has undertaken substantial efforts to isolate infected individuals and trace their contacts with others, including by publicly releasing information on those individuals’ recent movements, which has raised privacy concerns.)
Kim Woo-Joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University, told Science magazine that the country’s experience with a 2015 MERS outbreak ""showed that laboratory testing is essential to control an emerging infectious disease.""
The director-general of the World Health Organization highlighted the efforts of South Korea in a statement on March 18, saying the WHO was working with other countries ""to apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere.""
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under the Trump administration, also has pointed to South Korea as a model. On Twitter on March 12 he said the U.S. ""probably lost chance to have an outcome like South Korea,"" and wrote of the importance of ""aggressive screening to get people diagnosed."" The U.S., Gottlieb said, was ""far behind current caseloads"" with too many people not being able to get tested. ""So we can’t identify clusters and isolate disease.""
As we’ve explained before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a manufacturing problem with its test kit early in February when it shipped those kits to state and local public health labs.
In the March 24 coronavirus task force briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke about the importance of testing in helping the U.S. understand how pervasive the disease is and to contain it.
For areas of the country that don’t yet show large numbers of cases, ""they still have a window of significant degree of being able to contain,"" Fauci said. ""In other words, when you test, you find somebody, you isolate them, you get them out of circulation, and you do the contact tracing.""
With a large outbreak already underway, he said, ""it’s tough to do anything but mitigation."" But with more testing, ""you’re going to be hearing more about how we can inform where we’re going, particularly because we have the ability to test.""
The U.S. Versus South Korea, By the Numbers
The Trump administration has now claimed a milestone of sorts, compared with South Korea.
In a March 24 virtual town hall that was aired on Fox News, Birx said that the U.S. by that day ""will have done more tests than South Korea did in eight weeks in the last eight days."" She acknowledged, ""We have to do more.""
Trump repeated the claim later in the town hall, and both cited it again in the coronavirus task force briefing that day.
Trump, March 24 coronavirus task force briefing: You know, one of the things that’s — that’s happened — that we’ve done, I think, a really good job on — I think that it’s something special what’s happened is I learned from Dr. Birx, a little while ago, when she said — I learned it actually this afternoon: In eight days — because we kept hearing about South Korea. And they had a very tough time at the beginning, if you remember. In eight days, we’re doing more testing than they’ve done in eight weeks. That’s a tremendous turn.
Birx gave some specific figures. ""We now have 370,000 tests that have been done. The majority of those — over 220,000 in the last eight days, which, those of you who have been tracking the South Korea numbers, put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did in eight days,"" she said.
According to figures provided by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, South Korea had conducted 348,582 tests as of March 24 (including some that were pending). Beginning Jan. 31, about eight weeks earlier, testing using a diagnostic that could detect the virus within six hours had been conducted at government public health institute locations, and it was distributed to other health facilities on Feb. 7, according to the Korean CDC.
The U.S. CDC hasn’t released up-to-date figures on testing, which can take a number of days for results, according to LabCorp, one of the commercial labs conducting testing in the United States. Data provided by the COVID Tracking Project, which is run by journalists, researchers, scientists and others, shows higher figures for the U.S. than Birx cited: 317,347 tests completed or pending in the U.S. over the eight-day period of March 17 to 24. That’s less than South Korea’s roughly eight-week figure, but it’s close.
More important, South Korea’s population is 51.8 million; the U.S. population is 329.4 million. So, on a per-capita basis, the U.S. is still far behind.
South Korea has tested 0.7% of its population, or about 1 test for every 149 residents over that eight-week period. The United States has tested about 0.1% of its population, or 1 test for about every 1,038 residents over the eight-day period.
Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us that in order to cover a larger percentage of the population, which is what South Korea is trying to do, the U.S. would need to conduct more tests per capita. ""[S]imply pointing to total number of tests run without paying attention to the denominator of total population coverage, is misleading,"" he said in an email. 
To match South Korea’s testing rate, the U.S. would have needed to conduct about 2.3 million tests. The COVID Tracking Project shows a total of 433,545 tests completed or pending in the U.S. as of March 25. It’s feasible for the U.S. to match South Korea’s testing rate over several weeks, given the fact that the tracking project’s figures show about 50,000 to 70,000 tests being completed per day over the past few days.
""The percentage of people tested in the US is much, much lower than South Korea,"" Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us. 
Nuzzo noted a different testing philosophy between the two countries. The U.S. is reporting nearly 70,000 confirmed cases (as of March 26), but ""this is likely a large underestimate of the actual number of cases, as most of the testing done to-date is limited to patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized. Conversely, South Korea, which has only reported fewer than 10,000 cases is testing widely — not just limiting tests to hospitalized cases.""
In the March 25 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump repeated the claim about South Korea and said: ""We have tested, by far, more than anybody. We’re testing more than anybody right now. There’s nobody even close.""
But there are other countries that have done more tests on a per-capita basis than the United States, in addition to South Korea.
A chart compiled by Our World in Data, from official country reports, shows the U.S. lagging behind several countries on a per-capita testing basis as of March 20. And the U.S. hasn’t yet caught up to some of those countries. For instance, Australia had tested 4,473.4 people per million inhabitants as of March 20, while the latest figures for the U.S., which include five extra days, show a rate of 1,316 tests per million people, as of March 25.
Other countries that outpace the U.S. testing per capita include the United Arab Emirates, Germany and Austria, according to figures as of no later than March 20.
Similarly, testing data compiled by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, shows Italy had conducted 5,199 tests per million people, as of March 25; Switzerland had conducted 9,519 tests per million people, and the United Kingdom was just above the U.S. in per-capita terms, with 1,375 tests per million.
No Evidence U.S. Tests Are ‘Best’
Trump also has claimed in the past few days, without evidence, that the U.S. has ""the best tests,"" asserting they are ""the most accurate tests,"" ""better"" than South Korea’s and that this ""makes a big difference.""
Sampath, whose organization is testing COVID-19 tests from various manufacturers to provide independent verification for countries, told us there’s ""no data that would support"" the president’s claim, and ""no reason to believe US tests are any better (or worse)"" than those being run in other countries.
We asked the White House for support for the president’s claim, and we haven’t received a response.
Sampath told us in a phone interview that ""98% of all of the tests being done are molecular tests,"" and those are ""comparable"" no matter where they are run.
He said at some point there will be data available to make comparative evaluations, but right now it ""doesn’t exist.""
Update, April 3: Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. has done more tests ""than any other country anywhere in the world,"" and he went even further on April 2, making the false claim that this was the case ""both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most."" Despite having conducted more than 1 million tests, the U.S. is still behind Germany, Italy and South Korea on a per-capita basis.
A chart by Our World in Data shows those three countries had conducted significantly more tests per-million people than the United States as of April 1. The chart notes: ""There are substantial differences across countries in terms of the units, whether or not all labs are included, the extent to which negative and pending tests are included and other aspects.""

		Quick Take
Viral posts suggest that COVID-19 can’t be a serious disease if it hasn’t ""wiped out the homeless."" But recent reports published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found high rates of homeless residents testing positive for the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2.
Full Story
As the total number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. surpassed 1.4 million, including more than 89,000 deaths, in mid-May, viral memes misleadingly suggest that if COVID-19 was ""so deadly,"" it would have a devastating effect on the homeless population.
One frequently shared post, which uses a photo of actor Heath Ledger in his role as the Joker, states: ""IF THE CORONAVIRUS IS SO DEADLY WHY HASN’T IT WIPED OUT THE HOMELESS."" It continues: ""THEY LIVE OUTSIDE THERE IS NO SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THEY CAN’T WASH THEIR HANDS.""
One social media commenter added: ""Yes the virus is real but it’s not as serious as they say it is, …"" 
A similar post on Facebook reads: ""Serious question: How come we are not finding tens of thousands of homeless dead people in tents?"" Other versions of the post ask the same question. 
But the disease has indeed struck the homeless living on streets and in shelters throughout the U.S., and cases are likely to climb among this highly at-risk group.
A recent report published by the nonprofit National Alliance to End Homelessness projects that the homeless population in the U.S. ""will be twice as likely to be hospitalized, two to four times as likely to require critical care, and two to three times as likely to die as the general population"" as a result of the pandemic.
Actual numbers of how many homeless people have been infected or have died from COVID-19 are not known yet. ""There’s an ad hoc nature to not just the response to this crisis just generally speaking, but with the data tracking,"" Daniel Treglia, a co-author of the NAEH report, told us.
""Testing has been incredibly limited, and therefore the numbers are based on how many people are symptomatic, and we know those are understatements,"" said Treglia, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy and Practice.
Reports by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the pandemic has hit residents and workers in homeless shelters.
A CDC report on homeless shelters in four U.S. cities — Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and Atlanta — found that 25% of residents in 19 shelters tested positive for the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, from March 27 to April 15.
Another CDC report on three homeless service sites in Washington state concluded that ""COVID-19 was diagnosed in 35 of 195 (18%) residents and eight of 38 (21%) staff members."" That report also noted that ""COVID-19 can spread quickly in homeless shelters; rapid interventions including testing and isolation to identify cases and minimize transmission are necessary."" 
News media across the country also have reported infections and coronavirus-related deaths among local homeless populations.
With 150,000 homeless people throughout the state, California has ramped up efforts to transport homeless individuals to hotel rooms, the Associated Press reported on April 18. San Francisco experienced an outbreak at a homeless shelter where more than 100 people tested positive, including 10 staff members, according to the AP story. More than 30 homeless people tested positive for COVID-19 in Los Angeles County; six were living in a shelter, but most cases involved people living on the street.
In Boston, about 200 homeless individuals tested positive for the virus, WBUR reported on April 6. In New York City — after a reported 460 homeless individuals tested positive and 27 had died by mid-April —  Mayor Bill de Blasio announced new protective measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the city’s homeless population, according to an ABC News story.
In Washington state’s King County, which had 112 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among its homeless population or people working at service sites by April 20, shelters have made efforts to space out cots and sleeping areas within their facilities, the Seattle Times reported.
CDC estimates that there are 1.4 million people living in homeless shelters each year. It is a population with the potential for widespread transmission of COVID-19 because ""[h]omeless shelters are often crowded, making social distancing difficult,"" and ""[m]any persons experiencing homelessness are older or have underlying medical conditions, placing them at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness,"" the CDC said.
According to Treglia, co-author of the NAEH report, homeless people have about twice the mortality rate as the general population. The homeless population is ""at much higher risk of chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension — things that are associated with negative outcomes in COVID-19,"" he said.  
Other factors that make the homeless especially susceptible to the coronavirus include food insecurity and lack of proper nutrition, insufficient rest, difficulty complying with social distancing guidelines, and limited access to running water needed for hand washing and hygiene. 
""It is impossible for people who are sleeping on the streets or who are in shelters to stay at home,"" Treglia added. ""It just isn’t an option for them.""

		For nearly two months, President Donald Trump has touted an 85% decline in the nation’s COVID-19 case fatality rate since April — and has attributed the drop to improvements in treatment. But better treatment is only part of the story.
Experts say part, if not most, of the decline can be explained by expanded testing and a shift toward younger people — rather than higher-risk older folks — catching the coronavirus.
Since the end of July, Trump has wielded the impressive-sounding statistic in press briefings and rallies, playing up the effectiveness of existing therapies and claiming credit for those discoveries.
""Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus,"" he said in a July 27 briefing in North Carolina, ""the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April — think of that: 85%.""
In early August, Trump began mentioning specific drugs, even though several of them have yet to be proven to be effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality — and knowledge about another came from a British clinical trial.
""We’re developing a bounty of therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, antibody treatments — the antibody treatments are really working out well, really well — and many more that have allowed us to reduce mortality by 85% since April,"" he said in remarks at a Whirlpool plant in Ohio on Aug. 6.
In rallies and other speeches throughout September, the mortality drop has been one of his go-to lines. ""Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April,"" Trump has said, with slight variation, more than 10 times, often mentioning the antiviral drug remdesivir and convalescent plasma.
In an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, Trump went so far as to suggest that current treatments are so good that they’re ""pretty close to a cure.""
Trump, Sept. 12: We also have already come out with therapeutics, if you look at remdesivir and others, the plasma. You take a look at the things that we’ve come out with already and the number, we’re 85% better in terms of fatalities. You look at the kind of numbers, I don’t know if you’ve been seeing this, but we’re in — we’re really rounding the corner. And this is actually without anything further than we already have but we have some very good things out there already in terms of — I would say in terms of — you can’t use the word cure yet but pretty close to a cure. You’re going to be pretty close to a cure.
In fact, few proven therapies exist for COVID-19. 
""We are nowhere close [to] a cure,"" Dr. Eric Meyerowitz, an infectious disease specialist with the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, told us in an email, ""though we are certainly better off than we were in early March at the beginnings of the major surges in New York City and Boston.""
As we’ll explain, Trump’s statistic is a reference to the case fatality rate, which is an imperfect measure of mortality, as it is highly dependent on diagnostic testing. While he’s right on its precipitous drop, he gives the inaccurate impression that those gains are entirely due to treatment advances.
Increased testing and a greater proportion of infections among younger individuals are significant factors.
""More effective medical management may be playing a role in the falling case fatality rate in the US, but I suspect this improvement has been small relative to the large decrease,"" said University of Pennsylvania infectious disease fellow Dr. Aaron Richterman in an email.
Case Fatality Rate
Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to repeated inquiries about the source of 85% statistic, but our colleagues at PolitiFact were told by the White House that the president was referring to the case fatality rate — and were directed to a graph made by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine and an economist at Stanford University.
The case fatality rate, or CFR, is the percentage of deaths from the coronavirus among the confirmed cases.
In the graph, which plots the CFR on a weekly basis using a two-week lag to accommodate delayed deaths, the CFR reaches nearly 30% in mid- to late-March, before falling to about 10% on April 1 and steadily declining to less than 2% by late July. 
It’s a bit unclear if Trump’s specific statistic is derived from the graph, although the approximate numbers are consistent with an 85-90% decline between the beginning of April and late July. Bhattacharya told us he shared his graph with some colleagues, but didn’t know how the White House came to be aware of it.
We arrived at a similar result looking through a COVID-19 dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Using the ratio of COVID-19 deaths to probable and suspected COVID-19 cases, we calculated a crude CFR of 7.7% for all ages for the month of April. That dropped 83% to 1.3% in the month of July and further slipped to 0.9% for the month of August, for a total decline of 88% since April. (Note: The cumulative CFR remains much higher, at 3.4%, as it is predominated by the larger number of deaths early in the pandemic; the figures can be found using the visualization tool.)
Regardless of the exact data, Trump is correct that the case fatality rate has fallen substantially since April. Where he goes wrong is in attributing the steep decline to treatment improvements when other factors are also at play.
We’ve noted before the challenges in interpreting the CFR. Because it’s just a raw calculation of the number of observed deaths divided by the number of identified cases, it’s not an accurate estimate of the percentage of people who are infected with the coronavirus die, since it’s hard to know the true number of infections. 
In the beginning of the pandemic, when testing was still extremely limited, the U.S. was not capturing many of the less severe COVID-19 cases, which invariably led to an artificially high CFR. As testing expanded, more and more of those cases were included.
""In the early days, only the sickest cases were getting diagnosed, so unsurprisingly a higher % of these died relative to now, when many other cases are identified,"" explained Richterman.
During the month of April, only about 5.3 million tests were performed, versus more than 23 million each in the months of July and August, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
It also matters who is getting sick, and that has also changed over time. Richterman noted that early on, many outbreaks occurred in nursing homes — places with elderly folks with underlying conditions — where COVID-19 mortality is very high.
""Now, the epidemic is being propagated more in younger people, people living in congregate settings, people doing work in close quarters with inability to socially distance, etc.,"" he said. ""Many of these people have an inherently lower risk of death.""
Indeed, the CDC published a report on Sept. 23 describing the changing age distribution among those infected with the coronavirus, noting that in the early months ""COVID-19 incidence was highest among older adults"" but that shifted to people ages 20 to 29 over the summer. That younger cohort accounted for more than 20% of cases from June to August. 
Not Yet ‘Close to a Cure’
Improvements in treatment are likely part of the reason for the declining CFR — but not the only one, as Trump suggests.
Bhattacharya, who has said the scientific community has ""overreacted"" to the pandemic, told us there have been ""substantial improvements"" in COVID-19 treatment since the start of the pandemic, including ""improved protocols for ventilator use for people with severe viral pneumonia, and the availability of drugs like remdesivir and dexamethasone which have definitely improved outcomes.""
But he also said other contributors to the falling CFR were the shift toward lower-risk younger people and the fact that more widespread testing is picking up mild or asymptomatic coronavirus cases.
""I do not know of a study that … systematically decomposes these three contributors to declining CFR,"" he said. ""All three are important and the fact that the CFR picks up changes in all three makes it a statistic worth tracking.""
In his view, the high CFR numbers reported early on ""spread fear and panic,"" and he added that ""[i]t seems the responsible thing to do to report that the CFR has dropped since those early days.""
Other experts were less certain of the impact of improvements in treatment.
""The mainstay of treatment for severe COVID-19 is excellent supportive care in an intensive care unit, and this has not fundamentally changed over time,"" said Richterman. ""That said, in areas experiencing very large epidemics (New York City comes to mind), [it’s] plausible that overwhelmed health systems were unable to provide the best possible supportive care early on in the pandemic.""
Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University’s College of Public Health, also told PolitiFact that she suspects what matters most for the declining CFR are increases in testing and the switch to more infections in younger people — and that drug advances would be ""a much smaller piece of the pie.""
Richterman noted that in terms of specific therapies, only two evidence-based treatments are available: remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.
""While both might reduce risk of death, only dexamethasone has been proven to do so, and this would account for only a moderate reduction in risk of death relative to the large drop in case fatality rate,"" he said.
""We have a long way to go in our treatment,"" he added, contradicting the president’s rosy assessment of current COVID-19 therapies.
Although Trump frames the dexamethasone finding as an American development, it was the RECOVERY randomized controlled trial in the U.K. that first identified a mortality benefit of using the drug in select hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The finding was announced on June 16, well after the U.S.’s CFR began to fall.
To be sure, some American doctors used steroids such as dexamethasone prior to the study results, but until that point, whether the medication would hurt or help patients was unclear. And the study revealed that the drug did not help patients who did not need supplemental oxygen, and may have harmed them.
Remdesivir, which is made by the U.S. company Gilead Sciences, has not yet shown that it helps COVID-19 patients survive. The drug received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for those with severe COVID-19 on June 1 based on a study that found the drug shortened the time to recovery among hospitalized patients.
The study’s results hint at a possible survival advantage with the drug: the 14-day mortality was 7.1% among those given remdesivir versus 11.9% for those who received placebo. But Meyerowitz said the finding ""did not meet statistical significance, so with the data available there is no clear mortality benefit for remdesivir for hospitalized patients.""
If additional data show that those relative mortality figures hold, he added, then those getting remdesivir would be about 30% less likely to die.
As for convalescent plasma, although some of the results are promising, it too has not yet been proven to reduce COVID-19 mortality, as we’ve written before.
Following the FDA’s EUA for plasma for hospitalized COVID-19 patients on Aug. 23, the National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued a statement explaining that there is ""no data from well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials"" that show the therapy is safe and effective for COVID-19.
The statement noted that the FDA’s analysis of the Mayo Clinic’s Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma, which was at the core of the EUA decision, did not find a difference in seven-day survival among those given high- versus low-concentration plasma. Instead, a survival benefit was only observed in a subset of patients who were not intubated, with 11% of those receiving antibody-rich plasma dying within a week compared with 14% of patients given low-concentration plasma.
Based on the data, the panel neither recommends for nor recommends against the use of plasma.

      False Claim About CDC’s Global Anti-Pandemic Work

		As the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus has spread around the world, a number of politicians, news organizations and public figures have made the false claim that the Trump administration cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s anti-pandemic work in over 40 countries to just 10. The CDC told us that’s not true.  
The claim appears to have been based solely on outdated news reports from early 2018 that said the CDC was preparing to dramatically reduce its work helping to prevent infectious-disease epidemics. Those reports said much of that work on the Global Health Security Agenda, a pact between over 60 nations that began in 2014, had been funded by a five-year, nearly $600 million supplemental package that was dwindling. That one-time funding, which Congress originally appropriated in response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, ran out at the end of September 2019.
The director of the CDC’s Center for Global Health did say at the time that, without additional funding, its Division of Global Health Protection ""will have to scale its global health security portfolio to focus efforts based on existing resources,"" as the Wall Street Journal first reported in January 2018. If that happened, the official said the CDC would shift its focus to just 10 ""priority countries"" and ""plan for the completion of its country-based programs"" in 39 other nations, the Journal’s story said. 
Those hypothetical cuts were avoided, however, because Congress later provided more funding for the CDC’s global health programs, the CDC told us in a statement.  
But in remarks from the Senate floor on Feb. 24, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed the Trump administration made ""drastic cuts to the global health division at CDC,"" before saying, ""In 2018, CDC was forced to reduce the number of countries it operated in from 49 to 10.""
Three days later, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut made a similar claim on Twitter — though he used slightly different figures.
""President Obama set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries, as a way to protect against something just like Coronavirus breaking out across the world,"" Murphy wrote. ""Experts begged Trump to keep them open. He closed 37 of them.""
Murphy’s tweet appeared to catch the attention of Joy Behar, co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" who made the same claim on the daytime talk show March 9. 
Murphy’s office did not respond when we asked for a source for his statement, and Schumer’s office told us Schumer relied on a New York Times article that was published the day of his floor remarks. That Times piece was not the only one from a news outlet to state that the cutbacks the CDC warned about in 2018 had actually gone into effect.
As we said, the CDC told us that’s false.
""CDC did not have to cut back its work from 49 to 10 countries,"" said Maureen Bartee, CDC’s associate director for Global Health Security, in a statement to FactCheck.org. ""In the FY18-FY20 annual appropriations, CDC received base appropriations for global health security from Congress. This was used to continue the essential public health capacity development in the four core areas that was started in 2014 with the one-time supplemental funds.""
Those four core areas, Bartee said, are surveillance, laboratory systems, workforce development and emergency management and response. ""Focusing on potential weak links in these core areas ensures that partner countries are better prepared to respond to disease threats, wherever they might begin,"" she explained.
CDC operating budget plans show that its funding for global public health protection — which includes global disease detection and emergency response and global public health capacity — increased from $58 million in fiscal year 2017 to around $108 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. (And that does not include any remaining supplemental funds available for use.) The increases included nearly $50 million more each year for CDC’s global health security initiatives. 
Those amounts went up again in fiscal year 2020, when the CDC was awarded $183 million for global public health protection, overall, and $125 million specifically for its global health security efforts. For fiscal year 2021, President Donald Trump has requested that CDC funding for global disease detection and other programs be increased further — to $225 million total, with $175 million going directly to global health security.
With its current funding, Bartee said, the CDC is actually working in ""more than 60 countries"" — not 10 — to address the threat of global infectious diseases and outbreaks.
Bartee, email to FactCheck.org, March 10: In fiscal year 2020, the U.S. government, including CDC, is working with 19 priority partner countries to build preparedness and capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats at their source. These countries are Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, and Vietnam. In addition to these 19, CDC is supporting global disease detection, emergency and humanitarian response, and other global health protection activities in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Niger, Panama, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.  
Also, CDC is establishing platforms with regional offices to advance global health security and maintain a sustainable global presence. With this regional approach, CDC intends to implement a sustainable, long-term overseas operational structure, expand the reach of its technical assistance and programs, and strengthen disease outbreak response. CDC is currently establishing regional platforms in South America (Brazil), Eastern Europe/Central Asia (Georgia), Middle East/North Africa (Oman), and Southeast Asia (Vietnam). 
Beyond those countries listed here, CDC, along with other U.S. government agencies, continues to support a broad range of global health programs (e.g., HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, global immunization) that address global infectious diseases threats, as well as response to major outbreaks that require international assistance. All told, CDC is currently working in more than 60 countries.
For comparison, in 2017, the CDC said it worked with 17 ""Phase 1"" countries and another 14 ""Phase 2"" countries and CARICOM, an organization of 15 Caribbean island nations, on implementation of the Global Health Security Agenda. That’s the same number of countries the CDC said the U.S. originally committed to working with back in 2014. 
The ""Phase I"" countries receive financial support and technical assistance from CDC staff, while the ""Phase II"" countries receive technical assistance only.

COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020. But a meme featuring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis minimizes the toll the pandemic already has taken — particularly among the elderly. The meme also questions getting inoculated, despite the safety record of the vaccines and DeSantis’ public support for vaccines.

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How lethal is COVID-19?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How lethal is COVID-19?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              It’s difficult to know exactly how deadly COVID-19 is, but as the World Health Organization has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. The true rate isn’t clear, since the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed.
The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the United States as of July 9.
An individual’s risk of death may be significantly higher or lower than what these numbers suggest, depending on a person’s age or health conditions. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is more than 600 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29.

              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
Some politicians and pundits have downplayed the severity of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. One such example has sprung up again, this time with an additional message aimed at spreading fear about the vaccines.
An Instagram account promoting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as former President Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024, if Trump seeks office again, has shared a photo of DeSantis from September. In it, the governor is holding a sign that shows ""COVID-19 Survival Rates"" by age group, which range from 99.997% for those under 20 to 94.6% for those over 70.
The new version altered the original image by adding text that says, ""Do you really need that dangerous vaccine?"" But that message isn’t from DeSantis, who has been vaccinated and has encouraged others to get vaccinated.
Both of those messages, though — highlighting the survival rates and questioning the safety of the vaccines — are misleading.
Misleading Comparison Minimizes Risk
We’ll start with the original claim about the high survival rates for COVID-19.
DeSantis used the sign at a September press conference during which he announced that he would lift restrictions meant to curb the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.
The sign read:
COVID-19 Survival Rates by Age Group
0-19: 99.997%

20-49: 99.98%

50-69: 99.5%

70+: 94.6%
Small print at the bottom of the sign attributed the numbers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC didn’t publish those numbers, Jasmine Reed, an agency spokeswoman, told us in an email.
Instead, the Florida Department of Health used the CDC’s estimated ""infection fatality ratio"" for those age groups from a Sept. 10 report called ""COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios"" to calculate ""survival rates.""
It’s not wrong to figure out the survival rate that way, Dr. Julien Riou, a research fellow at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told us in an email. But in this case, the numbers are misleading.
Riou, who worked on the paper that the CDC cited for the estimated infection fatality rates, noted that the survival rate listed for those over 70 doesn’t reflect what the paper found. The survival rate for those between ages 70 and 79 would be about 95%, as the sign says, but the rate for those over 80 would be lower, about 70% to 80%, he said. That distinction wasn’t included in the CDC’s report either, though.
More importantly, focusing on the high survival rates minimizes the deadly toll that COVID-19 has already taken.
The fact is, more than 577,000 people nationwide have died of the disease, and COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020.
That’s ""unbelievable,"" Dr. Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, told us in a phone interview. ""Here’s something that came out of the blue and ranked behind cancer and heart disease.""
While it’s true that the estimated infection fatality rates for COVID-19 are under 1% for most age groups, the disease is widespread, he said. So the actual impact — the total number of deaths — is significant. More than 3 million people worldwide have died of the disease.
""One percent of a few people is small, but 1% of a lot of people is large,"" Vermund said. ""That’s what we have here.""
Highlighting strong survival rates, as this meme does, gives people false confidence, he said. It also doesn’t account for cases of long COVID-19, which can cause symptoms to last for months and have severe impacts on patients’ lives.
The bottom line is that both things are true: The percentage of those who die from COVID-19 may appear low, but the raw number of those who have died is high, Vermund said. Focusing only on the relatively low percentage of deaths minimizes the issue.
Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines
We’ll now address the newer claim suggesting that the vaccines are unsafe.
As we’ve explained before, clinical trials found no serious safety concerns for the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S., and more than 246 million doses have been administered so far.
That said, there have been some rare but serious reactions to the vaccines.
A relatively small number of people had serious allergic reactions after getting the three vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. As we’ve written before, some allergic reactions, including a potentially life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis, are to be expected with any vaccine. Fortunately, that kind of severe reaction is very rare — about 2 to 5 per million — and ""almost always occurs within 30 minutes after vaccination,"" the CDC says, so it can be quickly treated.
In April, regulatory agencies recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine while they investigated reports of a rare but potentially fatal blood-clotting condition among women under 50 years old. The investigation confirmed 15 cases of the rare condition, including three deaths, out of nearly 8 million vaccine doses of the J&J vaccine, as of April 21. The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration recommended resuming use of the shot with a warning of the rare, increased risk, explaining that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, and that the risk hasn’t been seen with the other authorized vaccines.
The obvious benefit of all these vaccines is that they reduce the rates of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. A recent government analysis in the U.K. estimated that vaccines there had prevented 10,400 deaths for those over 60 years old from December through March. During that time, more than 15 million vaccines were administered.
That works out to 693 deaths prevented per 1 million vaccine doses in the most vulnerable age group.
""We’ve seen the risks of COVID-19 — in individual health and public health,"" Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health, told us in a phone interview. The risks of the disease, as we described above, are visible and significant. ""That’s how we have to think about the risks of the vaccines,"" he said, in terms of what they prevent.
""We know that the vaccines currently in use have been tremendously effective in preventing hospitalizations and death,"" Schwartz said. ""They all but eliminate the outcomes of COVID-19 that have been so catastrophic.""
The most common consequence of the vaccines are sore arms and short-term symptoms, with some very rare cases of allergic reaction or blood clots, he said, comparing that to the prevention of hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 made possible by the vaccines. It’s ""literally a different level of magnitude,"" Schwartz said.
(See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: ""A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,"" ""A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine"" and ""A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine."")

		Quick Take
Uganda has had relatively low numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths — but not because of hydroxychloroquine, as an article on social media claims. Uganda’s guidelines initially included the use of the drug as an experimental medication, but studies showed it made no difference. Instead, the country implemented a strict lockdown and mask mandate that has limited the virus’ spread. 

Full Story
Hydroxychloroquine has been touted by some — including President Donald Trump — as a treatment for COVID-19. But studies have found it is not an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects for some patients, as we’ve reported.
False claims about the drug nevertheless continue to circulate on social media. An article shared on Facebook from the website palmerfoundation.com.au is headlined, ""Hydroxychloroquine is why Uganda, with a population of 43M, has only 15 COVID-19 deaths.""
""Uganda, a country in east-central Africa, has a 2018 population of 42.729 million, which is 13% of the United States’ population of 328.239 million in 2019,"" the article says. ""And yet Uganda has 1,603 COVID-19 cases and just 15 deaths (h/t Rush Limbaugh), whereas the U.S. has 5,656,744 COVID-19 cases and 175,105.""
The article continues, ""This is why: Uganda is afflicted with malaria, a disease caused by parasites that enter the body through the bite of a mosquito. Malaria is common in Africa. In 2012, Uganda had the 6th highest annual deaths from malaria in Africa. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug used to treat or prevent malaria.""
Related text posts claim, ""Uganda (43,000,000 people), where Hydroxychloroquine is eaten like candy due to malaria, have had 13 Covid deaths.""
The source of the viral social media article, palmerfoundation.com.au, is the website of The Palmer Foundation, a ""philanthropic entity owned by the Palmer family, headed by Clive Palmer,"" according to the site.  Clive Palmer is an Australian businessman and politician who made headlines when he announced in April that he had purchased 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, which he donated to Australia’s National Medical Stockpile. He has made baseless claims that the use of the drug lowered Australia’s COVID-19 mortality rate.
While the Uganda population numbers in the viral posts are accurate, the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths are outdated.  Uganda now has more than 9,800 cases and more than 90 deaths, while the U.S. has more than 7.7 million cases and more that 214,000 deaths.
Uganda does have far fewer per-capita cases and deaths than the U.S., but the posts offer a false explanation for why.
""It is extremely unlikely that relatively low rates of the [coronavirus] infection in sub-Saharan Africa are related to the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,"" Michigan State University malaria researcher Terrie Taylor told us in April. ""Neither has been the first-line treatment for malaria illness for many years,"" Taylor said.
Dr. William Worodria, a consultant physician at Uganda’s Ministry of Health and chairman of the country’s COVID-19 case management committee, said some treatment centers were using hydroxychloroquine when COVID-19 first appeared there.
""In our first guidelines we did include the use of hydroxychloroquine under experimental medication but when we looked at the evidence including local evidence of the two sides, one which used hydroxychloroquine and one which did not, there was no difference. So in our second guideline, we have removed it from therapy,"" Worodria said.
The second edition of Uganda’s national guidelines, which were issued in June, said ""Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine is no longer recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.""
So the nation’s low COVID-19 numbers have not been due to widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, but through other measures taken by the Ugandan government.
Reuters reported that Uganda closed schools and banned large gatherings three days before confirming its first COVID-19 case in March.
By the end of that month, most of the country’s businesses were shut down, vehicle movement was banned, and the government implemented an overnight curfew.  Passengers were screened at airports, and infected individuals were hospitalized in isolation wards.
The government also enacted a face mask mandate and had distributed more than 13 million masks to the public by May.
Public health experts told Reuters that Uganda had learned from experience battling other infectious diseases like Ebola and Marburg virus.
Uganda has announced the easing of some restrictions, but the country’s schools remain closed.

      CDC Data Contradict Julián Castro’s Texas COVID-19 Claims

		Cases of COVID-19 are increasing in Texas, but it doesn’t have the ""highest COVID positivity rate and case count in the nation"" — contrary to what Democrat Julián Castro recently tweeted.


Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration, highlighted the situation in Texas in a July 15 tweet criticizing the state’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott.


Castro was right about the percentage increase in COVID-19 related hospitalizations in Texas, which, according to state government data, grew from a recent low of 1,428 on June 27 to 2,519 on July 14, the day before his tweet was sent. Hospitalizations in the state have continued to increase in the days since, climbing to 3,046 on July 18. That’s an increase of 113% since June 27.


However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data contradict his claims about Texas having the highest test positivity rate and case counts.
Texas’ seven-day test positivity was between 8% and 9.9%, according to CDC data compiled as of July 15. That is the percentage of Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests, or NAATs, for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, that have come back positive.
At least four states — Louisiana, Arizona, Kansas and Mississippi — were within that same percentage range as Texas. And at least five other states — Arkansas, Florida, Utah, Nevada and Oklahoma — had a test positivity range of 10% to 14.9%.
As of July 19, Texas’ seven-day test positivity was in the range of 10% to 14.9%, along with at least 10 other states. At least one state — Nevada — was in the range of 15% to 19.9%.
The CDC says data were not available for all states.

Also, based strictly on the number of COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, Texas’ 16,569 cases ranked second behind Florida’s 39,349, according to CDC counts as of July 15. That’s not so surprising, considering that Florida and Texas are the two most populous U.S. states behind California — which ranked third in total COVID-19 cases in that period.
But when measured by cases for every 100,000 people — which allows for comparisons between states with different population sizes — Texas is much further down on the list.
As of July 15, Texas had a COVID-19 case rate of 57.1 per 100,000 people in the last seven days, per the CDC. That was a lower rate than 14 other states, from a high of 237.4 cases per 100,000 in Arkansas to 58.4 cases per 100,000 in Washington. In between those states were: Missouri (203), Florida (183.2), Nevada (153.6), Louisiana (151.4), Utah (112.4), Wyoming (102.6), Oklahoma (94.2), Kansas (91.9), Mississippi (88.3), Alabama (83.6), Alaska (70.1) and Arizona (76.5).
As of July 19, Texas had a rate of 75.5 cases per 100,00 people in the previous seven days. That was still lower than 12 states.











CDC map based on data as of July 15.
 






It’s worth noting that several of the states with the highest case rates in that time period also happen to be among the states with the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates.
According to CDC data as of July 19, none of the 13 states with the highest seven-day case rates, including Texas, have had more than 60% of their residents get at least one dose of the available vaccines. Out of those states, Florida had the highest percentage (55.6%) with at least one shot, and Louisiana had the lowest (39.9%). Texas was at 49.8%.
""This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a July 16 press briefing by the White House COVID-19 response team. She noted that ""over 97% of people who are entering the hospital right now"" with COVID-19 ""are unvaccinated.""
That’s similar to remarks she made in a July 1 briefing, when she said that ""preliminary data from a collection of states"" since January indicated that ""99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in these states have occurred in unvaccinated people.""
The Associated Press similarly reported in late June that ""nearly all"" — or about 99.2% — of the people in the U.S. who died from COVID-19 in May were not vaccinated. The unvaccinated accounted for nearly 99% of the COVID-19 related hospitalizations that month, as well, the AP said.


We asked Castro’s office which metrics or sources of data he relied upon for his claims, but we did not receive a response. The CDC data we found don’t support what he said about Texas’ COVID-19 positivity rate and case count.

      Trump Baselessly Alleges COVID-19 Vaccine Announcement Was Delayed

		In a series of tweets, President Donald Trump claimed — without evidence — that the pharma company Pfizer and his own Food and Drug Administration purposely held off on releasing positive interim results about a COVID-19 vaccine candidate until after the election.
Pfizer has said the timing of its announcement was not politically motivated and was dictated only by science.
The president also implied that the FDA had already approved Pfizer’s vaccine. The agency hasn’t commented on the shot at all, let alone authorized it.
Trump made his groundless claims in a string of tweets the evening of Nov. 9. Early that morning, Pfizer and BioNTech announced in a press release that its vaccine had been ""more than 90% effective"" in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in people without prior evidence of infection with the novel coronavirus. The result was an initial readout based on a total of 94 people developing COVID-19 in its phase 3 clinical trial.

As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn’t have the courage to do it before. Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2020


The @US_FDA and the Democrats didn’t want to have me get a Vaccine WIN, prior to the election, so instead it came out five days later – As I’ve said all along!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2020

Several Trump allies have similarly intimated that the timing of Pfizer’s announcement is suspicious, including Sen. Ted Cruz and the president’s eldest son, who asked in a tweet, ""Nothing nefarious about the timing of this at all right?""
But the timing is coincidental. ""At Pfizer, we are moving at the speed of science and only science guides all the decisions regarding our vaccine candidate,"" the company told us in an email. ""There are absolutely no political considerations involved in this process.""
In an interview with Axios, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that if he had received the results prior to the election, he would have released them then. But the findings didn’t become available until Nov. 8.
Bourla explained that the data came in several days after Election Day and then had to be reviewed by an independent committee, which met on Sunday, Nov. 8 at 11 a.m. Bourla didn’t learn of the news until the afternoon.
Bourla, Nov. 9: So the data came in on Thursday or Friday. And on — but you know, from the time that the data comes in, before the committee meets, some people need to prepare for each case a very big and accurate narrative. And the physician should sign it. So there’s a lot of work that needs to be done. But we did it with the speed of light. And once we had the 94 cases, they worked on the narratives, they worked on the tabulation of the results. So on Sunday morning, we didn’t want to lose a day, right? They didn’t do it Monday. They did it Sunday. The committee met and they reviewed the data.
While widely viewed as exceeding expectations, the greater than 90% efficacy number is still preliminary and does not mean the vaccine is ready to roll out. 
As Pfizer noted in its own press release, ""the final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary."" The company has not shared details on its efficacy data — including the exact breakdown of how many of the 94 volunteers who developed COVID-19 had been vaccinated — and the results have not yet been peer-reviewed.
""It’s important to note that we cannot apply for FDA Emergency Use Authorization based on these efficacy results alone,"" Bourla wrote in a Nov. 9 statement. ""More data on safety is also needed, and we are continuing to accumulate that safety data as part of our ongoing clinical study."" He added that the company also still needed to generate data to show that the vaccine can be consistently manufactured.
Scientists say other important questions remain, including how well the vaccine, which is given in two doses, works in different groups of people, such as the elderly; if the shots can protect against severe disease; whether the vaccine can prevent people from becoming infected or only from becoming sick; and how long protection lasts. The trial is designed to continue until at least 164 people become sick with COVID-19 and will include two years of follow-up to collect safety data.
In fact, despite the positive news, Pfizer hasn’t changed its estimate of when it thinks it will be able to submit an application to the FDA for authorization. Because of FDA guidance that asks for a median of two months of safety data after the second vaccine dose, the company still estimates that it will be ready to submit in the third week of November. That’s the same timetable Pfizer gave in mid-October.
The company did amend its protocols to require more COVID-19 cases than originally planned before the independent committee would take its first peek at the data. But there is no indication that this was done for political reasons, either.
Pfizer’s press release explains that the first interim analysis was initially scheduled to occur after 32 people in the trial developed COVID-19, but after discussion with the FDA this was set at a minimum of 62 cases. By the time those conversations concluded, the case count had reached 94 people, triggering the committee’s first look.
""We hope that analysis of efficacy at 94 cases will inspire greater public trust in our vaccine candidate than a potential readout at 32 cases,"" Pfizer told us in an email. ""In addition, it was important that the protocol changes required to omit the interim analysis after accrual of 32 cases and add new secondary endpoints to the study were agreed upon with FDA prior to conducting the interim analysis.""
In any case, Pfizer’s news also doesn’t change the fact that any authorized COVID-19 vaccine will not be widely available at first. Globally, the company anticipates having up to 50 million doses — enough for 25 million people — by the end of 2020. But as Bourla said in his Axios interview, even if the U.S. gets half of those doses, that means only about 12 million people would get the shots this year — ""a small part of the population.""
Trump’s FDA Tweet
In another Nov. 9 tweet, Trump repeated the unsupported claim that vaccine development would have gone more slowly under a different administration — and falsely suggested that the FDA had already approved a coronavirus shot.

If Joe Biden were President, you wouldn’t have the Vaccine for another four years, nor would the @US_FDA have ever approved it so quickly. The bureaucracy would have destroyed millions of lives!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2020

As we’ve written, there is no reason to think that vaccine development under Biden or any other American president would be significantly slower.
And, of course, the FDA has not authorized any COVID-19 vaccine yet. The Pfizer news is promising — and bodes well for such an authorization — but the company still has to wait for more safety data and must first submit an application to the agency.
The FDA hasn’t even commented on the new Pfizer results. There is nothing on the agency’s COVID-19 vaccine page about the interim results nor is there a reference to the news on the agency’s official Twitter account or that of FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn as of Nov. 10.
Unpacking Vaccine Credit
Trump and others have sought to cast Pfizer’s announcement as a win for the administration. In a Nov. 9 tweet, for example, Vice President Mike Pence attributed the interim trial results to Operation Warp Speed.


And in a Nov. 9 interview with Fox News, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also suggested the progress was due to Trump’s ""leadership"" and Operation Warp Speed.
Pfizer, however, has noted that unlike other companies, it did not bankroll its vaccine development or trials with the help of the government.
Kathrin Jansen, a senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, told the New York Times on Nov. 8, ""We were never part of the Warp Speed"" and the company has ""never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.""
But Pfizer did strike a $1.95 billion deal with the U.S. in July under the auspices of Operation Warp Speed. If its vaccine candidate is authorized, the government has promised to buy 100 million doses with the possibility of purchasing another 500 million doses.
The company clarified in a statement to FactCheck.org that it is a participant in Operation Warp Speed as a vaccine supplier — but emphasized that so far, development and manufacturing costs have been self-funded. ""We have already invested about $2 billion at risk and are prepared to continue bearing the costs of all development and manufacturing,"" a spokesperson wrote.
It’s not the case, then, that Trump’s ""public-private partnership"" is the only reason for Pfizer’s success to date, as Pence’s tweet may have implied.
But several experts have pointed out that the administration should get at least some credit. That’s because the future promise of the purchase of a large number of vaccine doses arguably helps reduce the financial risk for the company.
Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, for instance, told CNN: ""I think Operation Warp Speed helped with the clinical trial design and helped provide the financial incentive, knowing that there was going to be an advance purchase commitment for the vaccine. I think those were critical elements.""

A list of the ingredients used in COVID-19 vaccines is publicly available, and the ingredients don’t include microchips. Yet claims advancing conspiracy theories that they do continue to flourish. A recent video purports to show a microchip reader for pets detecting a chip in a vaccinated person’s arm — but the original video was created as a joke.

              The full ingredient list for any authorized COVID-19 vaccine can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website and in a variety of documents on the Food and Drug Administration’s website, including in a fact sheet for vaccine recipients that’s available in numerous languages. 
Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines contain messenger RNA, or mRNA; a variety of fatty molecules, or lipids, to protect the mRNA; and a few other ingredients, including salts and sugar, to keep the vaccine stable and at a similar acidity to the human body. The Johnson & Johnson, or Janssen, vaccine contains a harmless adenovirus — a type of virus that typically causes the common cold — modified with the genetic material for SARS-CoV-2, as well as salts as stabilizing and buffering agents.
There are no preservatives, egg or latex in the vaccines.

Full Story
Conspiracy theories about microchips in COVID-19 vaccines started circulating before any vaccines were even available.
The first one we wrote about was in April 2020 — eight months before the first vaccines rolled out in the U.S. Most recently, we debunked a claim that magnets were sticking to the arms of vaccinated people, allegedly proving that they had microchips in their arms.
Now a similar claim is circulating in a video that originated on TikTok, where it’s been viewed more than 15 million times, and has been copied and shared widely on Facebook.
The video shows a veterinary clinic worker in Ohio who says to someone off camera, ""Look what I just figured out, Justine. Scan this arm."" A microchip reader for pets then appears and scans her arm, showing nothing. ""Now here’s my vaccinated arm,"" she says, and the scanner shows a series of numbers.
The original video was shared with the hashtags, ""#vaccinesideeffect #chipped #chipfinder #covidvaccine #covidvaccinesideeffects."" After the video had received millions of views and thousands of comments, the person who posted it wrote, ""you guys clearly don’t know what a joke [is]. it’s obviously a dog chip… you guys believe anything on the internet.""
We reached out for further comment, but didn’t hear back.
Copies of the video that have been circulating on Facebook give no indication that it was made as a joke, and one version, which has received 11,000 views, was posted with this text: ""They are literally tagging and tracking everybody taking the Jab.""
But, as we’ve explained before, a list of the ingredients for each vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S. is publicly available, and the ingredients don’t include microchips.
Also, the manufacturer of the detection device shown in the video uses microchips that it describes on its website as being about the size of a grain of rice, 1.4 millimeters wide by 10.3 millimeters long.
The needles used to administer the COVID-19 vaccines are much smaller than that. They deliver the vaccine through a tube that measures less than half a millimeter wide.
So, as with the other microchip claims we’ve addressed, this video doesn’t prove anything nefarious about the COVID-19 vaccines.

      The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement

		A disagreement between Republican Sen. Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci has put $600,000 of U.S. grant money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology back into the spotlight, while making ""gain-of-function"" research a household term — all amid calls for more investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2.
At issue is whether the National Institutes of Health funded research on bat coronaviruses that could have caused a pathogen to become more infectious to humans and, separately, if SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 — transferred naturally from bats to humans, possibly through an intermediate host animal, or if a virus, a naturally occurring one or a lab-enhanced one, was accidentally released from the Wuhan lab.
There are a lot of unknowns, speculation and differences of opinion on these topics. But let’s start with what we do know: In 2014, the NIH awarded a grant to the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance to study the risk of the future emergence of coronaviruses from bats. In 2019, the project was renewed for another five years, but it was canceled in April 2020 — three months after the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S.
EcoHealth ultimately received $3.7 million over six years from the NIH and distributed nearly $600,000 of that total to China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, a collaborator on the project, pre-approved by NIH.
The grant cancellation came at a time when then-President Donald Trump and others questioned the U.S. funding to a lab in Wuhan, while exaggerating the amount of federal money involved.
Wuhan, of course, is where the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emerged in late 2019.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has studied bat coronaviruses for years and their potential to ultimately infect humans, under the direction of scientist Shi Zhengli, as the Scientific American explained in a June 2020 story. Such zoonotic transfer — meaning transmission of a virus from an animal to a human — of coronaviruses occurred with the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, which led to global outbreaks in 2003 and 2012. Both viruses are thought to have started in bats, and then transferred into humans through intermediate animals — civets and racoon dogs, in the case of SARS, and camels in the case of MERS.
Experts have suspected the SARS-CoV-2 virus similarly originated in bats. Researchers in China — including at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — have said the virus shares 96% of its genome with a bat virus collected by researchers in 2013 in Yunnan Province, China. (While that’s quite similar, Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa who studies coronaviruses and a pediatric infectious disease physician, told us it would be ""impossible"" to take such a virus and make the kind of changes required to turn it into SARS-CoV-2 in a lab. One would need a virus that’s 99.9% similar, and ""in theory it might work."") 
An article published in Nature Medicine in March 2020 said that the virus likely originated through ""natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,"" or ""natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer."" The researchers, who analyzed genomic data, said SARS-CoV-2 ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" While they said an accidental laboratory release of the naturally occurring virus can’t be ruled out, they said they ""do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.""
In an April 2020 statement, University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of SARS-CoV-2, responded to ""unfounded speculation"" that the bat virus with 96% similarity was the origin of SARS-CoV-2. He said: ""In summary, the abundance, diversity and evolution of coronaviruses in wildlife strongly suggests that this virus is of natural origin. However, a greater sampling of animal species in nature, including bats from Hubei province, is needed to resolve the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2.""
The U.S. Intelligence Community said in an April 30, 2020, statement that it ""concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,"" and that it ""will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.""
The zoonotic transfer theory hasn’t been proven; for example, no intermediate animal host, as was the case for SARS of MERS, has yet been identified. Lab-accident theories haven’t been proven either — whether a lab worker could have been infected by a naturally occurring virus and then transmitted it outside the lab, or, as Paul and others suggest, a lab-manipulated virus could be the origin.
But recently there has been renewed debate over the origin. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for ""more investigation"" to determine how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began. ""Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,"" they wrote. ""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""
Jesse Bloom, one of the organizers of that letter, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, told us in an email: ""We know that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that circulate in bats, so the deep origins of the virus are definitely from bat coronaviruses. As far as the immediate proximal origins, we simply don’t know the details.""
Bloom said zoonotic transfer either directly from a bat to a human or through an intermediate host animal is possible, as is a lab accident from research of similar viruses. ""Because we don’t know the details for either of these scenarios, it’s not possible to say whether a hypothetical lab accident would have involved a virus exactly identical to that isolated in nature, or one that had been grown or somehow modestly manipulated in a lab. At this point, all of these are hypothetical scenarios, and while different scientists may have different guesses at how likely each scenario is, we need more information before anyone can be certain.""
The scientists are hardly alone in calling for more investigation.
As the letter noted, the U.S. government, along with 13 other countries, also had called for more inquiry into the origins in a March statement this year.
""It is critical for independent experts to have full access to all pertinent human, animal, and environmental data, research, and personnel involved in the early stages of the outbreak relevant to determining how this pandemic emerged,"" the statement said. ""With all data in hand, the international community may independently assess COVID-19 origins, learn valuable lessons from this pandemic, and prevent future devastating consequences from outbreaks of disease.""
The European Union made a similar statement. Both came in response to the release of a report by an international team convened by the World Health Organization. That report said a laboratory leak of a virus, involving ""an accidental infection of staff,"" was ""an extremely unlikely pathway,"" but the WHO director-general said that he didn’t believe the evaluation ""was extensive enough.""

""Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the day the report was publicly released on March 30. ""Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table.""
In a May 11 Senate hearing, Paul raised the issue of the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and said some in the government weren’t interested in investigating the lab-leak theory. The Kentucky senator said that ""government authorities, self-interested in continuing gain-of-function research say there’s nothing to see here."" He went on to assert a tie between U.S. researchers and the Wuhan Institute of Virology and accused them of ""juicing up super-viruses,"" asking Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, if he still supported ""the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan.""
Fauci responded that ""the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.""
In a subsequent interview on ""Fox & Friends"" on May 13, Paul said he didn’t know whether SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab. ""Nobody knows,"" he said. But he posited that if it did, Fauci, among others, ""could be culpable for the entire pandemic,"" adding, ""I’m not saying that happened. I don’t know.""
Paul made the money-is-fungible argument, saying the NIH gave money to the lab, regardless of what that particular grant funded. But then asserted that NIH funding furthered risky gain-of-function research. The answer to the question of whether it did or didn’t depends on whom you ask and their definition of gain-of-function.
Hours after his May 11 exchange with Paul, Fauci said at a fact-checking conference hosted by PolitiFact.com that it would ""almost be irresponsible"" to not collaborate with Chinese scientists given that the 2003 SARS outbreak originated in China. ""So we really had to learn a lot more about the viruses that were there, about whether or not people were getting infected with bad viruses.""
He called the EcoHealth collaboration ""a very minor collaboration as part of a subcontract of a grant,"" and said Paul conflated that with the claim that ""therefore we were involved in creating the virus, which is the most ridiculous, majestic leap I’ve ever heard of.""
Fauci said he wasn’t convinced that the coronavirus developed naturally. ""I think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability exactly what happened.""
Fox News’ Tucker Carlson raised these issues on his show on May 11, saying: ""The guy in charge of America’s response to COVID turns out to be the guy who funded the creation of COVID. We’re speaking of Tony Fauci and the gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan laboratory that the U.S. government with his approval paid for."" There’s no evidence that the Wuhan laboratory, with or without funding from an NIH grant, created SARS-CoV-2.
The night before, Carlson referred to a May 2 article on Medium by former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade. In that piece, Wade wrote about ""two main theories"" of SARS-Co-V-2’s origin: ""One is that it jumped naturally from wildlife to people. The other is that the virus was under study in a lab, from which it escaped."" Wade asserted that the ""clues point in a specific direction"" — a lab-leak. But he said at the outset: ""It’s important to note that so far there is no direct evidence for either theory. Each depends on a set of reasonable conjectures but so far lacks proof.""
Gain-of-Function
Gain-of-function is a term that could describe any type of virology research that results in the gain of a certain function. But the type that’s controversial, including among scientists, is research that causes a pathogen to be more infectious, particularly to humans.
In 2014, the U.S. government put a pause on new funding of gain-of-function research, which it defined this way: ""With an ultimate goal of better understanding disease pathways, gain-of-function studies aim to increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility."" A 2016 paper on the ethics of gain-of-function research said: ""The ultimate objective of such research is to better inform public health and preparedness efforts and/or development of medical countermeasures.""
The pause — intended to provide time to address concerns about the risks and benefits of these studies — applied to certain research on influenza, MERS and SARS.
""Specifically, the funding pause will apply to gain-of-function research projects that may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route,"" the White House said in an Oct. 17, 2014, announcement.
As a Nature article at the time explained, there had been fierce debate among scientists on exactly what research should be deemed too risky. And some confusion on where the line would be drawn for this pause.
""Viruses are always mutating,"" the article said, ""and [Arturo] Casadevall [then a microbiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City], says that it is difficult to determine how much mutation deliberately created by scientists might be ‘reasonably anticipated’ to make a virus more dangerous — the point at which the White House states research must stop.""
In July 2014, a group of scientists and experts called the Cambridge Working Group issued a statement calling for such a pause of ""[e]xperiments involving the creation of potential pandemic pathogens … until there has been a quantitative, objective and credible assessment of the risks, potential benefits, and opportunities for risk mitigation, as well as comparison against safer experimental approaches.""
Well over 300 scientists have since signed on to the statement, which expressed concern about the risk of accidental infection in lab studies that created ""highly transmissible, novel strains of dangerous viruses, especially but not limited to influenza.""
The debate over this type of research dates back to at least 2011, when research was done on flu strains made to spread in ferrets.
Paul cited the Cambridge Working Group in his May 11 and 13 remarks. But the group has not made ""any statement … about work in Wuhan,"" Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and one of the founder members of the group, said on Twitter.
Lipsitch further said that some members of the working group ""may categorically oppose all GOF studies that enhance virulence, transmission, or immune escape. My personal view is that some such studies can be justified on risk-benefit grounds, while those on flu to date cannot.""
On Dec. 19, 2017, the U.S. government’s pause, or moratorium, was lifted. The Department of Health and Human Services announced a framework for evaluating whether funding should be granted for research involving ""enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,"" or PPPs. It said research on PPPs was ""essential to protecting global health and security,"" but the risks needed to be considered and mitigated.
The framework defined a ""potential pandemic pathogen"" as one that was both ""likely highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations"" and ""likely highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans."" And an enhanced PPP was a PPP ""resulting from the enhancement of the transmissibility and/or virulence of a pathogen.""
The framework said enhanced PPPs don’t include ""naturally occurring pathogens that are circulating in or have been recovered from nature.""
EcoHealth Grant
So, did the NIH’s grant to EcoHealth fund gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab? There are differing opinions on that. As noted above, whether research is ""likely"" or ""reasonably anticipated"" to enhance transmissibility can be subjective.
EcoHealth and the NIH and NIAID say no. ""EcoHealth Alliance has not nor does it plan to engage in gain-of-function research,"" EcoHealth spokesman Robert Kessler told us in an email. Nor did the grant get an exception from the pause, as some have speculated, he said. ""No dispensation was needed as no gain-of-function research was being conducted.""
The NIAID told the Wall Street Journal: ""The research by EcoHealth Alliance, Inc. that NIH funded was for a project that aimed to characterize at the molecular level the function of newly discovered bat spike proteins and naturally occurring pathogens. Molecular characterization examines functions of an organism at the molecular level, in this case a virus and a spike protein, without affecting the environment or development or physiological state of the organism. At no time did NIAID fund gain-of-function research to be conducted at WIV.""
And in a May 19 statement, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said that ""neither NIH nor NIAID have ever approved any grant that would have supported ‘gain-of-function’ research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans.""
Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University and a critic of gain-of-function research, told the Washington Post that the EcoHealth/Wuhan lab research ""was — unequivocally — gain-of-function research."" He said it ""met the definition for gain-of-function research of concern under the 2014 Pause."" That definition, as we said, pertained to ""projects that may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route.""
Alina Chan, a molecular biologist and postdoctoral researcher at the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, said in a lengthy Twitter thread that the Wuhan subgrant wouldn’t fall under the gain-of-function moratorium because the definition didn’t include testing on naturally occurring viruses ""unless the tests are reasonably anticipated to increase transmissibility and/or pathogenicity."" She said the moratorium had ""no teeth."" But the EcoHealth/Wuhan grant ""was testing naturally occurring SARS viruses, without a reasonable expectation that the tests would increase transmissibility or pathogenicity. Therefore, it is reasonable that they would have been excluded from the moratorium.""
Chan, who has published research about the possibility of an accidental lab leak of the virus, also said: ""But we need to separate this fight about whether a particular project is GOF vs whether it has risk of lab accident + causing an outbreak.""
The University of Iowa’s Perlman told us the EcoHealth research is trying to see if these viruses can infect human cells and what about the spike protein on the virus determines that. (The spike protein is what the coronavirus uses to enter cells.) The NIH, he said, wouldn’t give money to anybody to do gain-of-function research ""per se … especially in China,"" and he didn’t think there was anything in the EcoHealth grant description that would be gain of function. But he said there’s a lot of nuance to this discussion.
""This was not intentional gain of function,"" Perlman said, adding that in this type of research ""these viruses are almost always attenuated,"" meaning weakened. The gain of function would be what comes out of the research ""unintentionally,"" but the initial goal of the project is what you would want to look at: can these viruses infect people, how likely would they be to mutate in order to do that, and ""let’s get a catalog of these viruses out there.""
Perlman also said that making a virus that could infect human cells in a lab doesn’t mean the virus is more infectious for humans. Viruses adapt to the cell culture, he said, and may grow well in a cell culture but then, for instance, not actually infect mice very well.
Back in February, MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt told PolitiFact.com that a 2017 paper published with the help of the EcoHealth grant involved, as PolitiFact described it, ""certain techniques that … seemed to meet the definition of gain-of-function research."" But Esvelt said ""the work reported in this specific paper definitely did NOT lead to the creation of SARS-CoV-2,"" because of differences between the virus studied and SARS-CoV-2.
In the May 11 hearing, Paul also pointed to the work of Ralph S. Baric, a professor of epidemiology and a microbiologist who studies coronaviruses at the University of North Carolina. Paul described Baric’s research as ""gain of function"" in collaboration with the Wuhan lab. A 2015 paper by Baric, Shi and others, published with NIH funding in the journal Nature Medicine, examined the potential of SARS-like bat coronaviruses to lead to human disease. Researchers created a ""chimeric virus"" with the spike protein of the bat coronavirus and a mouse-adapted SARS backbone and found viruses could replicate in human airway cells. The study said ""the creation of chimeric viruses … was not expected to increase pathogenicity.""
Fauci told Paul at the hearing: ""Dr. Baric does not do gain-of-function research, and if it is, it’s according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina, not in China.""
In a statement to us, Baric said: ""Our work was approved by the NIH, was peer reviewed, and P3CO reviewed,"" meaning reviewed under the HHS 2017 framework. ""We followed all safety protocols, and our work was considered low risk because of the strain of coronaviruses being studied. It is because of our early work that the United States was in a position to quickly find the first successful treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and an effective COVID-19 vaccine.""
Kelsey Cooper, Paul’s communications director, told us ""there is ample evidence that the NIH and the NIAID, under his direction, funded gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" citing Ebright’s statements. ""In light of those facts, the question Dr. Paul asked was whether the government has fully investigated the origin of the disease, which it clearly has not. This research and the lab should be thoroughly investigated and opened to public scrutiny.""
Perlman told us that he thought Fauci’s response in the May 11 exchange was correct — that no money was given for gain-of-function research. But, he added, there’s a scientific discussion to be had on the benefits and risks of research making recombinant viruses, which involves rearranging or combining genetic material. The politicization of the issue, Perlman said, ""doesn’t do anybody good.""
Update, July 1: Please see our June 25 story ""The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus"" for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic.

		Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden answered questions from the public in a CNN town hall, but he got some facts wrong and misled on others:

Biden made the far-fetched claim that data show President Donald Trump could have prevented ""all"" of the U.S. deaths from COVID-19 if he ""had done his job."" There’s no research that supports such a claim.
Biden wrongly claimed the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently said ""wearing masks would save 100,000"" U.S. residents from dying of COVID-19 between now and January. That’s a projection from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, not the CDC director.
The former vice president misleadingly claimed Trump ""said that no longer would we … provide masks for schools."" One federal program to pay for masks ended, but another aims to distribute up to 125 million masks for schools.
Biden appears to have exaggerated when he said Trump had been told the coronavirus was ""seven times more contagious than the flu."" Trump told journalist Bob Woodward the virus might be five times more lethal than the flu. The coronavirus is about two to three times more contagious.
Biden wrongly claimed that ""we now have a larger trade deficit … than we’ve ever had with China."" He would have been right two years ago, but not now.
He claimed that capping orphan oil and gas wells could create 250,000 jobs. We only found support for 120,000 jobs.
Biden falsely claimed that Trump has never condemned the far right and white supremacists.

The Sept. 17 town hall was held near Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, at a drive-in theater to maximize social distancing.
Far-Fetched Claim About Preventing ‘All’ Deaths
Biden claimed Trump could have prevented ""all"" of the deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 if he ""had done his job,"" citing unspecified ""data."" We know of no such data or any research that would support that notion.
Biden: And if president had done his job — had done his job from the beginning — all the people would still be alive. All the people — I’m not making this up, just look at the data. Look at the data.
The Biden campaign hasn’t responded to our request for the ""data"" Biden said supports his claim. But it’s far-fetched to say any leader could have done something to prevent every single one of the more than 197,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States.
We don’t know what actions Biden believes the president could have taken to stop all deaths. But even if the U.S. had implemented incredibly strict travel limitations very early on, the body of research shows that could have delayed the spread of the virus but not contained it. We reviewed that research when Trump claimed that the travel restrictions he instituted on China had saved ""hundreds of thousands"" of lives. There’s no support for that figure.
And there’s no support for the idea that a severe travel policy would have saved all lives, either.
Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us in April that previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the travel limitations have to be very strict to have an effect. Travel restrictions ""can have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,"" Omer said. But, ""even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.""
Even countries with much smaller outbreaks than the U.S. have had some deaths from COVID-19. Biden mentioned Canada in his town hall, saying, ""Last Friday, we had a thousand deaths, all of Canada had zero deaths."" That’s correct, according to figures from Worldometer. But Canada still has had deaths from COVID-19 — more than 9,000 deaths.
Even the tiny European country of Liechtenstein — population 39,000 — has had one death among its 112 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine’s Coronavirus Resource Center.
Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email: ""There is no data to make the claim that ‘all the people would be alive.'"".
Riley said the president could have better mitigated the spread of the coronavirus. ""The epidemic would have been under better control by now and many deaths could have been prevented had the President allowed organizations like the CDC do their work without his interference,"" Riley said. ""It can be clearly said the President’s actions not only prevented control of the epidemic but even fueled the epidemic. That’s what Biden should have said.""
Face Masks
Biden claimed the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, said wearing masks would save 100,000 lives from now until the beginning of next year. He didn’t.
""His own CDC director contradicted him recently,"" Biden said referring to Redfield, whom Trump appointed to lead the CDC in 2018. ""He said, if in fact, you just wore this mask, nothing else, but this mask, you would save between now and January, another hundred thousand lives.""
That’s a projection from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — not Redfield.
On Sept. 3, IHME said its updated model projected there would be 410,000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 at the end of 2020. IHME also said that 122,000 of those deaths could be prevented with increased mask use.
In congressional testimony on Sept. 16, Redfield did tell senators that face masks ""are the most important, powerful public health tool we have"" against COVID-19.
""I will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings,"" he said. ""I have said it, if we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks we would bring this pandemic under control. … We have clear scientific evidence they work and they are our best defense. I might even go so far as to say that this facemask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.""
But Redfield didn’t say ""100,000 lives"" could be saved by wearing masks.
Misleading on Masks
Biden misleadingly claimed Trump ""said that no longer would we in fact provide masks for schools … because it was not a national emergency."" The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it would stop this month reimbursing states for the costs of masks for schools, but the Department of Health and Human Services said it would provide up to 125 million cloth masks for schools.
Biden: The president of the United States said that no longer would we in fact provide masks for schools — for schools — pay them to have the masks in school, because it was not a national emergency. What is he talking about? It’s totally irrational.
NPR reported on Sept. 1 that Keith Turi, FEMA assistant administrator for recovery, told state and tribal emergency managers that FEMA would stop on Sept. 15 reimbursing states for cloth masks and other personal protective equipment for places that are deemed nonemergency locations — including schools.
""The changes narrow what constitutes an ’emergency protective measure’ and is thus eligible for FEMA’s Public Assistance Program,"" NPR, which obtained a recording of the call, said.
But that doesn’t mean the federal government isn’t providing any masks to schools. The same NPR story noted the HHS would provide up to 125 million masks to schools.
HHS’ Public Health Emergency webpage says: ""The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be providing up to 125 million cloth masks to states for distribution to schools. The Administration intends for these masks to support students, teachers, and staff in public and private schools reopening, with an emphasis on students who are low-income or otherwise with high needs and schools providing in-person instruction.""
NPR also said states may stock up on such protective equipment before the FEMA policy went into effect. ""The FEMA policy is not retroactive, so it could lead to a swift stockpiling during the next two weeks as states rush to get purchases in under the wire,"" NPR reported.
COVID-19, Flu Comparison
Biden appears to have exaggerated when he said, ""The idea that you’re going — to not tell people what you’ve been told, that this virus is incredibly contagious, seven times more contagious than the flu.""
Biden may have been referring to the revelation that Trump, while downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 to the public, had told journalist Bob Woodward in interviews that Trump knew the novel coronavirus was highly contagious and deadly.
""Bob, it’s so easily transmissible, you wouldn’t even believe it,"" Trump told Woodward on April 13, according to an audio recording Woodward recently released.
In an earlier conversation, on Feb. 7, Trump told Woodward the virus was more fatal than ""even your strenuous flus."" Trump said ""this is deadly stuff,"" adding that it might be five times more lethal than the flu.
But there’s no indication that Trump said the virus was ""seven times more contagious than the flu.""
As we wrote in late January, an early estimate from the World Health Organization suggested that every infected person would spread SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average. A team at Imperial College London pegged the basic reproductive number — the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual — at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland estimated the reproductive number, or R0, to be around 2.2, and Harvard University researchers estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1.
The WHO later said in mid-March that the reproductive number, which reflects potential transmission, ""is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza.""
Seasonal influenza has an R0 value ranging from around 1 to 2. That would mean SARS-CoV-2 is about two to three times more contagious.
Jobs Capping Abandoned Wells
In response to a question about whether he supports ""the continuation of fracking safely and with proper guidelines,"" Biden pivoted to discuss the creation of so-called green jobs.
In doing so, he appeared to exaggerate the number of jobs that can be created by capping orphan oil and gas wells. Orphan wells are gas and oil operations that have been abandoned and there is no responsible party to pay for closing up the wells.
Biden: We can provide for right now as you know, for thousands of uncapped wells because a lot of companies gone out of business, whether they’re gas or oil facilities, we can put to work right away 250,000 people from iron workers and other disciplines, making union wages.
We don’t know where Biden got his figure of 250,000. He used the same number in a climate change speech three days earlier.
A recent report by the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University estimated that a ""significant federal program"" could potentially create ""as many as 120,000"" jobs — about half of what Biden said. That assumes plugging 500,000 wells at a cost of between $12 billion and $24 billion.
The number of orphaned wells is significant, but not known. The Columbia report said there are ""56,600 documented unplugged orphaned wells as of 2018,"" citing a report by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multistate government entity. ""Addressing 500,000 wells would require state, tribal, and federal agencies to identify and prioritize hundreds of thousands of additional wells,"" the Columbia report said.
Update, Sept. 19: Biden’s energy plan on his campaign website also cites the 250,000 figure but includes ""reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines,"" as well as ""plugging abandoned oil and natural gas wells"" for that amount of job creation. 
U.S.-China Trade Deficit
Biden wrongly claimed that ""we now have a larger trade deficit … than we’ve ever had with China."" He would have been right two years ago, but that is no longer true.
In fact, the trade deficit with China is less than it was in the last year of the Obama administration.
It’s true that the U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services was a record $380 billion in nominal dollars in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The previous high was $337.3 billion in 2017 — roughly the same as it was in 2015 when Barack Obama was president and Biden was vice president.
But the trade deficit fell last year to $308 billion — which is slightly below the $310 billion trade deficit in Obama’s last year in office in 2016.
And it continues to fall. The most recent 12 months on record (ending in June) shows a deficit of $273.3 billion – which is $37 billion, or 12%, less than what it was in 2016.
Dan Ikenson, director of Cato’s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, attributed the declining trade deficits in large part to Trump’s trade war with China, which began in 2018 and resulted in both countries imposing escalating trade tariffs on certain imports.
Ikenson told us in an email that trade deficits, in general, are the result of ""macroeconomic phenomena,"" not trade policy. But ""tariffs imposed on a particular country"" — such as China — can affect trade deficits with that country. The impact of the tariffs on the U.S. trade deficit with China ""was profound in 2019,"" he said, and the U.S. trade imbalance with China has continued to fall in 2020 due to ""the tariffs and the global economic contraction.""
Trump Has Condemned White Supremacists
Biden falsely claimed that Trump has never condemned the far right and white supremacists. He did, in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
It is true, however, that Trump has done so rarely, and has far more frequently condemned violence on the left. The president declined to criticize Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Trump supporter charged with killing two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with an assault-style weapon.
Biden: I’ve condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is. No matter what the source is. The president is yet to condemn, as you’ve probably noticed, the far-right and the white supremacist, and those guys walking around with the AK-47s and not doing a damn thing about them. … But folks, I’m waiting for the day when he says I condemn all those white supremacy, I condemn those militia guys as much as I do every other organizational structure.
As we have written, after a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017, in which one person was killed and others were injured, Trump said, ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides.""
But much of the press coverage focused on another remark Trump made, that there had been ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville.
So two days later, Trump issued a statement from the White House in which he specifically condemned the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
Trump, Aug. 14, 2017: As I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.
And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.
Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.
According to the journalist Bob Woodward in his book ""Fear,"" Trump later told Rob Porter, a White House aide at the time who had urged him to make the second statement, ""That was the biggest fucking mistake I’ve made. You never make those concessions. You never apologize. I didn’t do anything wrong in the first place. Why look weak?""
When given an opportunity to condemn the actions of the pro-Trump teenager who allegedly killed two protesters in Kenosha, Trump demurred.
Reporter, Aug. 31: Are you going to condemn the actions of vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse?
Trump: We’re looking at all of it. And that was an interesting situation. You saw the same tape as I saw. And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we’re looking at right now and it’s under investigation. But I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been — I — he probably would have been killed.

      Trump’s Spin on ‘Broken’ Testing

		While his administration has faced criticism for being slow to ramp up testing for coronavirus infections, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the problem was with his predecessors, saying the administration ""inherited a broken system"" that it ""rebuilt."" That’s misleading.
The president has a point that the testing system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alone couldn’t conduct the kind of wide-scale testing the coronavirus pandemic demanded, as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said.
But several former officials have reiterated Fauci’s comments, explaining that the CDC simply isn’t set up to be a commercial test lab, let alone the only test lab for the country in a pandemic like this. And it was a month after the administration declared a public health emergency that it took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability. 
""The CDC designed a good system."" Fauci said on March 13. ""If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector.""
Another problem, which we’ve outlined before, was a manufacturing issue with the CDC’s test kits, which it had sent to state and local public health labs in early February.
The CDC didn’t provide a fix for the manufacturing issue for more than two weeks after it revealed the problem. The Food and Drug Administration then, on Feb. 29, said it would allow labs to create and use their own in-house tests immediately, and about a week later, private diagnostic companies began to step in with their own tests.
Weeks prior, two former Trump administration officials, in a Jan. 28 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, had recommended working with the private sector to meet the anticipated testing needs, saying past experience showed the CDC wouldn’t be able to handle the volume of testing.
""If the number of cases increases, experience from the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2015 Zika epidemic suggests that the CDC will struggle to keep up with the volume of screening. Government should focus on working with private industry to develop easy-to-use, rapid diagnostic tests that can be made available to providers,"" wrote Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, and Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the FDA.
Dr. Pierre E. Rollin, who worked for the CDC for 27 years, retiring in 2019 as head of an epidemiology team for the Viral Special Pathogens branch, told us the U.S. government, and the CDC in particular, ""never had the capability"" to produce large quantities of tests. It hasn’t been the case, Rollin said, that one institution ""governmental or nongovernmental"" would produce test kits for the entire population.
Rollin pointed to flu testing as an example: Those are commercial tests, with the CDC playing a role in checking different commercial tests and helping labs verify they’re getting good results.
""I don’t think it would be reasonable for a government institution to decide to compete with private industry. That doesn’t make sense,"" said Rollin, who wrote a March 26 opinion piece for STAT, saying it ""shouldn’t come as a surprise"" that the CDC wasn’t able to respond quickly to a pandemic like this but questioning why the CDC ""seems to be sitting on the sidelines for this pandemic"" now. 
Borio also told NPR in a late March interview that ""traditionally, our nation has relied on the CDC to get the initial testing out to public health labs. So they’re the first to launch, and they have done so with tremendous success over prior epidemics. But we have to remember that they’re not a manufacturing facility; they are a research and reference lab,"" she said. ""And in this instance, they encountered some serious technical challenges which really exposed a significant vulnerability in our national capability to roll out tests quickly.""
Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the CDC during the Obama administration, from 2009 to 2017, similarly told USA Today that Trump’s claim about a ""broken"" testing system is ""just wrong. They inherited the system that has worked in every prior emergency. Now, it’s fair to say this is an emergency like no other. But CDC tests were never supposed to meet the entire need for the United States.""
Frieden said in a March 31 opinion piece for USA Today that in addition to the CDC’s flawed test kit being a problem, the FDA ""was slow to allow hospital labs to develop their own tests"" and the Department of Health and Human Services was also late in working with the private sector to develop widely distributed tests.
Trump, however, has blamed ""a testing situation that just wasn’t right,"" as he said in the March 29 coronavirus task force briefing. ""It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken, and it was only good for a very small situation.""
Former and current officials have explained that having the CDC distribute tests was only good for a relatively small situation, but that doesn’t mean the system was ""obsolete"" or ""broken.""
The following day, the president repeated the assertion, saying in the task force briefing that ""this administration inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work. It was okay for a tiny, small group of people, but once you got beyond that, it didn’t work."" He added, ""We have built an incredible system.""
And Trump said in a March 30 ""Fox & Friends"" interview: ""We inherited a broken test. The whole thing was broken and we rebuilt it."" (There was, of course, no inherited ""test"" for the new coronavirus, but the president appears to have misspoke in that instance. He went on to talk about the amount of testing being done now in the United States.)
We asked the White House for an explanation of the president’s repeated comments, but we haven’t received a response.
Here we provide a timeline of the testing issues and the administration’s statements and response.
Jan. 18: The CDC test was operational, as a subsequent CDC report suggests.
Jan. 20: The CDC used its own kit to confirm the first case of COVID-19 in the U.S.
Jan. 24: The CDC confirms the second case in the U.S. ""Currently, testing must take place at CDC, but CDC is preparing to share these test kits with domestic and international partners,"" the agency said.
Jan. 31: The Department of Health and Human Services declares a public health emergency for the U.S.
Feb. 5: The CDC ships test kits to state and local public health labs, as well as international labs.
Feb. 12: The CDC reveals that some labs were having problems when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked. It was a manufacturing problem with one component of the test, CDC later says.
Feb. 25: Only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing — in addition to the CDC processing tests itself. ""Commercial labs will also be coming online soon with their own tests,"" a CDC official tells reporters.
Feb. 28: The CDC says it had a fix for the manufacturing problem and had manufactured new tests.
Feb. 29: The FDA says labs can create and use their own in-house tests as long as they complete an emergency use authorization request within 15 days.
March 4: Trump falsely claims that he had to end an Obama-era FDA ""rule"" to more quickly provide diagnostic tests to the public. Experts later told us no such formal regulation was ever implemented under President Barack Obama. Trump may have been referring to the Feb. 29 FDA announcement, allowing labs to use their own tests before getting an emergency use authorization approved by the FDA. But that announcement allowed an exception to a de facto FDA policy; there was no ""rule"" that needed to be overturned.


March 5: LabCorp says its test is available for health care providers to order. Quest Diagnostics says it will provide testing four days later.
March 6: The U.S. had conducted 1,326 tests, according to data collected by The COVID Tracking Project, including tests with results pending. The group, run by journalists, researchers, scientists and others, says it attempts to provide ""the number of people being tested, not specimens submitted,"" but it also notes state public health authorities, the source of the bulk of the data, are inconsistent in the way they report their information and the quality of their data varies.
March 12: In a congressional hearing, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asks who was in charge of ""making sure … as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible."" Fauci answers: ""The system — the system does not — is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing. … The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.""
March 13: Trump declares a national emergency. The administration holds a coronavirus task force briefing in which Trump announces a ""new partnership"" with the private sector. ""Ten days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on a solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests,"" he says.
At the same briefing, Fauci says: ""The system was not designed — for what it was designed for it worked very well. The CDC designed a good system. If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector. And this is exactly what you’re seeing, because you can’t do it without it. So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need. Now, looking forward, the system will take care of it.""
Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, credits Trump for asking for ""an entire overhaul of the testing approach"" and calling on ""private sector laboratories"" to develop tests. ""Following the meeting last week, major commercial laboratory equipment and diagnostic companies took immediate action to adopt and develop new testing systems,"" she says.
Trump and Birx suggest Google was developing a screening website that large numbers of Americans could use to see if they should be tested and where they could go to get a test. But it turns out the website is a project of a sister company to Google and limited to the San Francisco Bay Area.
March 16: Roche announces that it will have completed shipping the first 400,000 of its high-volume tests to hospitals and reference labs by the end of the week.
March 16: A total of 41,814 tests had been conducted in the U.S., according to The COVID Tracking Project.
March 21: The FDA announces it has given emergency use authorization to a 45-minute test developed by Cepheid for point-of-care use in hospitals to help manage patients and health care workers. Cepheid plans to start shipping tests by the end of March.
March 24: Trump and other administration officials tout a milestone in testing, saying by that day the U.S. will have done ""more testing"" in eight days than South Korea had done ""in eight weeks."" But on a per-capita basis, the U.S. still lags behind South Korea, and other countries, as we explain.
Trump says, without evidence, that the U.S. test ""is considered the best test."" One expert told us there’s ""no reason to believe US tests are any better (or worse)"" than those being run in other countries.
March 27: Abbott labs announces that it has received emergency use authorization from the FDA for its point-of-care test, which provides results within 13 minutes. Unlike the LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics tests, specimens don’t need to be mailed in to be tested — a process that can take several days — and instead can be run on a toaster-sized machine in urgent care clinics or doctors’ offices.
March 31: The U.S. had conducted 1.1 million tests, according to The COVID Tracking Project.
March 31: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio tells CNN the state isn’t ""quite sure"" when it will see a peak in cases but expects it will be ""between mid-April and mid-May."" DeWine says: ""Part of this is driven by the fact that we don’t have, you know, widespread testing. That is not unique to Ohio.""
Correction, April 2: We originally wrote that it was more than a month after HHS declared a public health emergency that the administration took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, including by the private sector. It was one month before the FDA allowed labs to use their own in-house tests, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability. We have corrected the story.

		President Donald Trump has enthusiastically pushed the use of two malaria drugs — one in combination with an antibiotic — to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. But there is currently only limited evidence to suggest the drugs are effective against the new virus.
Over a series of press conferences and on Twitter, Trump has repeatedly expressed his optimism that two existing malaria drugs — chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine — will work in COVID-19 patients. Both drugs are also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Calling himself a ""big fan"" of hydroxychloroquine, Trump said in a March 20 press conference that he had ""seen things that are impressive,"" even as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that the evidence supporting the drug was anecdotal — and that it would take a large, well-done clinical trial to prove its effectiveness.
As we have written previously, Trump left the misleading impression that the FDA had approved chloroquine to treat COVID-19. In fact, there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, although existing drugs can be legally prescribed by doctors to treat other ailments for which they weren’t approved in what’s called off-label prescribing.
After the release of a small clinical trial in France, Trump also trumpeted combining hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin, which is sold under the brand name Zithromax.
""HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,"" Trump wrote in a March 21 tweet. ""Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents)….. ….be put in use IMMEDIATELY,"" he added, referring to the journal in which the French study appeared.
But as we’ll explain, the trial has significant caveats and limitations — and far more data is needed to know whether the drugs are safe and effective to treat COVID-19.
In a press conference the following day, Trump exaggerated the existing evidence for the pharmaceuticals being sent to New York state for COVID-19 clinical trials. 
Trump, March 22: There’s been some tremendous signs that this could work. Now, again, you know, some doctors think it should go for years in testing. But, you know, this has been something that’s been around for many years. It’s been phenomenal — a strong, powerful drug for malaria. But we think it might work on this, based on evidence — based on very strong evidence. We’re going to see. We’re going to know on — you know, sometime after Tuesday.
It’s not clear which drug Trump had in mind, but New York state said in a press release that it received shipments of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and chloroquine.
Trump is entitled to his opinion of how the trials will turn out, but he overstates the evidence supporting the drugs, which is slim.
Lab Studies in Cultured Cells
At least two studies have found that hydroxychloroquine has antiviral effects against the new coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, in cells grown in the lab. Publishing in Clinical Infectious Diseases on March 9, researchers in Beijing found that hydroxychloroquine was better than chloroquine in preventing the virus from replicating in cultured monkey cells.
Another Chinese group reported on March 18 that hydroxychloroquine blocked entry of the virus into the same kind of cultured cells, and also appeared to prevent the virus from being released from cells. The drug, however, was less effective against the novel coronavirus than chloroquine.
These are suggestive findings, but as Peter Hotez, a professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us, the experiments by themselves don’t mean all that much. 
""Hydroxychloroquine has some activity in a test tube against the virus,"" he said. ""But it’s hard to know how that corresponds to clinical disease.""
In the past, for example, chloroquine has been found to inhibit a variety of viruses in cells, including influenza and chikungunya. But when tested in animals or people, those results didn’t hold. In fact, in nonhuman primates, chloroquine treatment made their chikungunya infections worse, not better.
The authors of the second SARS-CoV-2 report also cautioned that while hydroxychloroquine is usually considered less toxic than chloroquine, overdoses are still possible — and in their experiment, the drug killed a fair number of cells at the levels needed to produce antiviral effects. That feature, they wrote, ""requires careful designing and conducting of clinical trials to achieve efficient and safe control of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.""
The rest of the so-called evidence for hydroxychloroquine is largely anecdotal — essentially, people around the world trying it, and claiming it has worked. 
Trump, for example, tweeted a link to New York Post story about a 52-year-old Florida man with COVID-19 who said hydroxychloroquine had saved his life. The president later appeared to reference the man in his press briefing, falsely suggesting that the drug had been ""approved"" to treat COVID-19 ""in record-setting time.""
But as Fauci has explained in press briefings, without a controlled clinical trial, in which a treatment group can be compared with a control group, it’s impossible to say whether the drug actually did anything — or whether the person improved for other reasons.
China has reportedly used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in some COVID-19 clinical trials, but most of those studies haven’t been published yet. 
One that has been published — a small randomized controlled trial of 30 COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms — found ""no significant reduction in time to clinical improvement or viral clearance in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the conventional therapy control group,"" according to a World Health Organization report. 
The authors of the trial concluded that the drug needed to be tested in a larger group of patients.
The French Study
It turns out that the French study Trump cited was, in at least one respect, less rigorous than the Chinese clinical trial. 
The study, which was done at a hospital in Marseille, France, calls itself a clinical trial, but it wasn’t a randomized controlled trial, and therefore, not the type of study that can actually determine whether a treatment is effective. 
Rather than randomly selecting which patients would receive the treatment — thereby minimizing any differences between groups that could affect the outcome — the study used those who refused the hydroxychloroquine treatment as the control group. Controls also included patients at other hospitals in southern France.
The study was very small, ultimately including just 20 patients who received hydroxychloroquine — six of whom also received azithromycin — to compare against the 16 patients who did not. 
The study also did not test for clinical outcomes. Instead, researchers measured the amount of virus in patients over time using nasal swab samples, and found that after six days, those treated with hydroxychloroquine had less virus and were more likely to test negative for COVID-19. 
According to the paper, on the sixth day, only two of the 16 untreated patients tested negative, compared with eight of the 14 hydroxychloroquine-only patients and all six of the dual-treated patients.
While the results may sound impressive, they don’t say anything about whether patients’ conditions or symptoms improved, and the lack of randomization means it’s not possible to attribute the differences in the virus amount, or what’s called viral load, to the treatments.
Many scientists identified other odd details and possible technical errors when they commented on the paper on the preprint site medRxiv. The paper, curiously, was posted on the preprint site on March 20, the same day it was published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, and had been accepted just a day after submission — raising questions about whether there was a peer-review process and how thorough it was.
The Immunology Institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine’s review noted that of the 26 original patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, six were lost to follow up, including three who transferred to the ICU, one who died, and one who decided to stop treatment because of side effects.
""Total length of clinical follow up was 14 days, but the data beyond day 6 post-inclusion are not shown,"" the review reads, adding that the way the authors reported the viral loads was not standardized, making it ""impossible to compare what is defined as a positive value between the patients in the control and treatment arms."" Many of the control patients also didn’t have nasal swabs taken every day.
Update, April 7: On April 3, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal in which the French study appeared, issued a statement of concern about the paper, writing that the group ""believes the article does not meet the Society’s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.""
On Twitter, Australian National University geneticist Gaetan Burgio lambasted the study, saying, ""In short, all this hype on the clinical trial is based on a open label, non randomized and underpowered clinical trial on [hydroxychloroquine] treatment against #COVID19 with viral load as an outcome that was not properly measured in 2/3 of the control cohort !!!""
To at least some scientists, then, the outsized attention this particular study has received is unwarranted. But it’s important to recognize that even if the French study had been done perfectly and had been randomized, it still wouldn’t be particularly strong evidence that the drugs work, since the study is so small.
Baylor’s Hotez said that when small studies are repeated with more patients, the results often don’t pan out. This is a normal part of science, but it’s why scientists like to see larger clinical trials before concluding a drug is safe and effective.
""The likelihood that this is actually going to be a useful therapy is not high, but it’s not zero, either,"" Hotez said of the drug combo. ""So we’ll just have to see how it works in larger clinical studies.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several trials are planned in the U.S. to test hydroxychloroquine’s ability to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, this includes a 1,600-person prevention study for people exposed to COVID-19 patients in New York and a similar study by the University of Minnesota involving 1,500 people across the U.S. 
The World Health Organization is also coordinating a large multinational trial called SOLIDARITY, which among other potential COVID-19 treatments, will test chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.
Other Considerations
When it comes down to it, Hotez is not especially optimistic about the drugs Trump has promoted, and said he’d prefer a different experimental therapy for COVID-19.
""If I was a patient or a family member, hydroxychloroquine and azithromax would not be my first choice,"" he said. ""My first choice would be the plasma convalescent antibody.""
The idea behind convalescent plasma — which is hardly new, having been used in the 1918 influenza pandemic — is to harvest antibodies from the blood of people who have been infected with the virus and have recovered, and infuse them into sick patients to help them fight off the virus. 
While the treatment doesn’t work for every disease and carries some risks, Hotez said it did work during the 2003 SARS epidemic, which was caused by a highly similar coronavirus. ""And so this has a much higher probability of success,"" he said.
It’s worth noting that although the drugs Trump has touted are generally well tolerated, they do have side effects, and it’s not clear if there might be more extreme or other negative effects specifically in COVID-19 patients.
As a March 24 viewpoint article in the Journal of the American Medical Association explains, it’s often assumed the benefits of ""last resort"" medications will offset the harms, but that’s not always the case. 
""A common interpretation of off-label use and compassionate use of drugs is that if the patient died, they died from the disease, but if the patient survived, they survived because of the given drug,"" the article reads. ""This is not true.""
According to the article, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can trigger abnormal heart rhythms and many of the sickest COVID-19 patients are elderly and may have heart problems, it’s possible the drugs could ""increase the risk of cardiac death."" 
Still, given the circumstances, some U.S. hospitals have included these drugs in their COVID-19 guidelines, as they view the potential benefits to outweigh the risks. The U.S. Society of Critical Care Medicine, however, has neither endorsed nor advised against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, due to ""insufficient evidence.""
More broadly, the promotion of unproven drugs for COVID-19 is having other unintended effects. In Nigeria, two people were hospitalized for chloroquine overdoses, and in Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after the couple ingested fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine. Many patients with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, who rely on hydroxychloroquine to keep their symptoms at bay have also reported shortages of the drugs as orders related to COVID-19 have spiked. 
Without naming any names, in a March 23 editorial H. Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the prestigious journal Science, cautioned against excessively hyping therapies that remain speculative. 
""Political overhyping of such approaches is extremely dangerous — it risks creating false expectations and depleting drugs needed to treat diseases for which they are approved,"" he said. ""And it sets science up to overpromise and underdeliver.""

Evidence of the efficacy of face masks to help control the spread of the novel coronavirus has grown since the start of the pandemic.

Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Lab tests, for example, show that masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Analyses of people who came into contact with those with COVID-19 have also found mask-wearing to be associated with a reduced risk of contracting the virus. Numerous studies similarly document an association between self-reported mask wearing and control of the virus in a community or the implementation of a mask mandate and a subsequent decline in COVID-19 cases.
While each of these study types has its limitations, collectively, most experts agree that masks are likely to reduce transmission of the coronavirus and should be used by members of the public when around other people. Some research also indicates face masks can protect the wearer as well.
Masks, however, should not be viewed as fool-proof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. For optimal performance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people select masks that are well-fitting and multi-layered.

Full Story
A Missouri-based chiropractor — who has been previously warned by federal officials to stop spreading misleading content regarding unproven COVID-19 treatments — is now wrongly telling Facebook users that face masks have been proven ""unsafe"" and ""ineffective.""
In a Feb. 11 video live-streamed on Facebook and viewed more than 70,000 times, Eric Nepute rattles off a list of 20 arguments against wearing face masks — claiming, for example, that they cause cavities and ""facial deformities"" and increase the chances of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
But many of Nepute’s claims are false, misleading or unsupported. And a central takeaway — that masks are ""ineffective"" — is rebuffed by recent evidence to the contrary.

Two doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently summarized the growing evidence that masks can help to control community spread of the virus. In a piece for the Journal of the American Medical Association, they wrote: ""Compelling data now demonstrate that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce the spread of this infection, especially as source control to prevent spread from infected persons, but also as protection to reduce wearers’ exposure to infection.""
Rather than cite credible research on masks, Nepute largely adapted his claims from a January post on the website of the Canada-based Centre for Research on Globalization. That website has pushed conspiracy theories about the 9/11 terrorist attacks and other topics; a recent State Department report said the website ""has been a steady source of anti-U.S. and anti-Western disinformation and propaganda ever since"" its 2001 debut.
For his part, Nepute has spread unsound advice before, drawing the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC in May sent a letter warning Nepute that he was unlawfully advertising products and services — including chiropractic care and intravenous vitamin therapy — to treat or prevent COVID-19. The letter advised him to ""immediately cease making all such claims.""
Update, April 28: The FTC and Department of Justice announced on April 15 that the government had charged Nepute with violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act ""by deceptively marketing products containing vitamin D and zinc as scientifically proven to treat or prevent COVID-19."" It was the first civil complaint alleging violations of the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, which was part of an appropriations package signed into law in December.
Throughout Nepute’s 24-minute video about masks, he repeatedly urges viewers to visit his website for vitamins while presenting the faulty claims about face masks — and later, COVID-19 vaccines and more.
Here, we’ll fact-check a few of the claims in the video. 

Misleading Cavities Assertion
Nepute begins: ""Reason no. 1 — this is wild right here. Cavities. I didn’t even know this was a thing until I started digging into it about a week or so ago. New York dentists are reporting that half their patients are suffering from decaying teeth at a higher rate in 2021 and 2020 than they had been before, due to — and this is Dr. Rob Raimondi — he told Fox News that just a week ago, that people are getting cavities from wearing a mask.""
The underlying story from the Centre for Research on Globalization that is being used by Nepute refers to an interview that Raimondi, a dentist in New York, did with the New York Post in August, which was republished on the Fox News website. Raimondi told the Post that his practice was seeing people with gum inflammation and ""cavities in people who have never had them before … about 50% of our patients are being impacted by this.""
But the American Dental Association told us in a statement that ""[t]o date, we have seen no evidence of an increase in cavities in the last year, or that wearing a mask affects your risk of cavities.""
Dr. Patricia Corby, associate dean of translational research in the department of oral medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, similarly told us in an email that ""there is no rationale why wearing a mask would increase decay or periodontal disease. Also, no research has been done to prove otherwise.""
What Raimondi and a colleague told the Post, more specifically, was that wearing a mask can increase mouth dryness, since people may breathe more through their mouth when wearing a mask, which can lead to bacteria building up. But they didn’t advocate against wearing masks.
Raimondi in a subsequent Instagram post about the interview said, ""We absolutely support mask wearing."" He recommended some ideas for avoiding dry mouth.
The American Dental Association likewise told us that ""excessive breathing through your mouth, whether you are wearing a mask or not, may increase development of dry mouth, which increases the risk of cavities. Saliva helps to keep the mouth moist and remineralize tooth enamel which helps fight decay. Even when wearing a mask, it is best to breathe through your nose. Another good way to decrease the risk of cavities is to drink fluoridated water. This can help to avoid dry mouth as the fluoride in the water will help prevent tooth decay.""
Corby said COVID-19 could have affected individuals’ dental and oral health in another way: The pandemic prompted dental clinics around the world to shut down — and some practices to close completely. Even when some could reopen, she said, the pace was slow and some patients were hesitant to visit the dentist.
Unsupported Claim on ‘Facial Deformities’
""No. 2: Facial deformities. Masking children triggers mouth breathing, which has been shown to cause narrowing of the face, narrowing of the mouth, high vaults in the palate, dental malocclusions — and the list goes on and on,"" Nepute tells his viewers. ""This is according to the Journal of General Dentistry. They say you shouldn’t wear one.""
He’s referring to the Academy of General Dentistry’s journal, General Dentistry, which did not say not to wear a mask. The report being referenced didn’t evaluate masks at all.
Instead, the 2009 report looked at the implications of mouth breathing in children.
Dr. Callan White, a dentist and national spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry, told us by phone that the video’s claim requires ""several jumps."" There is no scientific evidence showing that children resort to exclusively breathing through their mouth while wearing a mask, he said, and that they do so for long enough to mirror children who experience chronic mouth breathing.
""Children who suffer from these conditions aren’t able to breathe through their nose at all, or very little, at all times. This condition creates the most harmful effects at night while the child is sleeping,"" he told us in an email. ""There is a significant difference in frequency and duration of the habit"" of mouth breathing due to wearing a mask.
""With this said, remind children to breathe through their nose while wearing a mask, make sure the mask properly fits the child, take mask breaks when possible, and clean/disinfect cloth masks frequently (discard disposable masks as directed by manufacturer),"" he added.
Distorted Claim on Risks
Nepute also misleadingly claims that face masks are associated with an ""increased risk of COVID-19.""
""What, wait a minute, I thought I was wearing a mask to stop the spread of COVID-19?"" he says. ""Just like when they told me that I’m getting a vaccine to stop the spread, that doesn’t do it either."" (We’ll address his factual distortions about vaccines later in this story.) He then cites ""public health officials of Ontario"" to claim that ""mask use by the general public could be associated with the … theoretical elevated (risk) of COVID-19.""
That’s a reference to a September document issued by Public Health Ontario that described what the agency knew about the use of masks to control the spread of the coronavirus — including the benefits, which Nepute fails to mention.
Instead, Nepute homes in on only one part of the document, which says: ""Mask use by the general public could be associated with a theoretical elevated risk of COVID-19 through decreased physical distancing and self-contamination.""
But those, again, are theoretical risks — and ones that can be mitigated if other steps are taken while wearing masks.
The first theoretical risk is that people wearing masks may not maintain physical distancing. But that’s why health officials have continued to advise that masks should be worn in addition to, not in place of, distancing.
And the second theoretical risk Nepute is citing, of self-contamination, ""refers to evidence that shows the frequency of face-touching behaviour in general,"" Public Health Ontario told us in an email.
The agency said ""the point about the ‘theoretical elevated risk’ is taken out of context.""
""If the outside of a mask is contaminated, there would be a theoretical risk that touching the mask then touching your face could result in exposure to virus … the mitigation for that is frequent hand hygiene,"" PHO told us. ""PHO continues to monitor and review the emerging evidence on non-medical masks and COVID-19.""
The agency further noted that the same document being cited also said on its first page that ""the evidence shows that public mask-wearing is likely beneficial as source control and mandatory public mask policies have been associated with a decrease in new COVID-19 cases compared to regions without such policies.""
Baseless Claim About Bacterial Pneumonia
""Bacterial pneumonia is on the rise,"" Nepute says. ""We’ve seen a ton of that in our practices. We’ve seen so much respiratory bacterial infections it’s not even funny, especially among children.""
He adds: ""In Oklahoma press conference, Dr. James Meehan indeed testified, reporting coming from all of his colleagues are showing, across the world, increase in bacterial pneumonia.""
Nepute is referencing an ophthalmologist who was speaking out against a mask mandate in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in August. Meehan claimed (at 4:40) that ""reports coming from my colleagues all over the world are suggesting that bacterial pneumonias are on the rise."" He went to say he believed ""untrained members of the public are wearing medical masks repeatedly, in a non-sterile fashion.""
It’s true that experts do not recommend that medical masks that are meant to be worn once be reused.
But we found no evidence to suggest that cases of bacterial pneumonia are on the rise — or that masks are causing such a trend. And experts have debunked different iterations of the same claim before.
For example, Dr. Catharine Paules, an assistant professor at Penn State who specializes in infectious diseases, has said ""there is no data"" to support the claim that masks trap in bacteria and fungus and make people more susceptible to bacterial or fungal pneumonia.
And our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters debunked a viral falsehood in September that mask-wearers were ""arriving in ICU with antibiotic resistant strains of pneumonia from breathing in the pathogenic organisms they were meant to exhale.""
Nepute goes on to wrongly claim that ""oh, by the way, that’s the No. 1 thing that killed everybody during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Not the virus, but the bacterial infections. These masks are causing this.""
That’s inaccurate, too.
In 2008, researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — including the institute’s director, Dr. Anthony Fauci — published a study that found that most deaths from the 1918 flu pandemic likely resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia after contracting the flu.
""The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs,"" the National Institutes of Health said in a release explaining the study.
So to suggest the flu wasn’t involved in those deaths is wrong. Furthermore, that study made no mention of masks.


Assessing the Impact of Vitamin D
After trying to discredit masks and erroneously suggesting vaccines are ineffective, Nepute asks, ""Why are you not doing the things that do work?"" and turns his attention to vitamin D. He later pitches an offer for a ""patriot pack"" of vitamins that includes vitamin D3 and zinc.
Nepute shows a Healthline story from October, headlined: ""New Study Found 80% of COVID-19 Patients Were Vitamin D Deficient.""
""That’s why you should be taking vitamin D every day,"" he says. ""This is like the 100th study that’s shown vitamin D helps with this.""
He’s overstating things.
We addressed this topic several months ago and explained that, while vitamin D might be helpful in terms of COVID-19, there isn’t enough scientific evidence yet to know whether it can treat or prevent the disease. Research is ongoing.
That said, health experts do advise getting enough vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle, regardless. Most of a person’s vitamin D is made in the skin by exposure to sunlight.

The Healthline story was about a study published in October in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism that evaluated the vitamin D levels of 216 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It found that the hospitalized patients had lower levels of vitamin D compared with a group in the general population — although it didn’t identify a relationship between lower vitamin D levels and more severe disease among those patients.
While suggestive, the study doesn’t prove that vitamin D was a factor in whether those patients fell ill or that taking vitamin D supplements would have helped, as it was not a randomized controlled trial.

Vaccine, Testing Claims


Nepute again returns to the topic of COVID-19 vaccines, asking: ""What do you mean it works?"" He goes on to add: ""Effective in what? It does not stop the spread of the virus. You understand that, right?""
First of all, the main point of the vaccines is to prevent those who contract the novel coronavirus from becoming seriously ill with the COVID-19 disease. And in that regard, they are highly effective. For more information, see our SciCheck story ""Q&A on COVID-19 Vaccines.""
As for Nepute’s suggestion that vaccines won’t stop the spread of the virus, as we’ve explained before, it’s currently unclear how much the vaccines will limit transmission. But there’s a good chance they will help curb transmission to some degree: Experts say with other vaccines, a vaccinated person, even if infected with the virus, often sheds less virus, therefore making them less contagious.
Nepute also shows viewers the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, scrolling through entries and saying, for example: ""Here’s what happened, this person had this done — it was the Pfizer vaccine — they died. This person had abdominal pain, it was life-threatening.""
But as we’ve explained before, anyone can report to that system through an online form, and there is no vetting of the reports. And there is no evidence that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are harming people on any kind of wide scale. Many have the expected sore arms or temporary flu-like symptoms following vaccination, but serious side effects are uncommon, according to the CDC.
The CDC notes that reports of death to VAERS following vaccination ""do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the death"" and that it ""follows up on any report of death to request additional information and learn more about what occurred and to determine whether the death was a result of the vaccine or unrelated.""
It adds: ""To date, VAERS has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate a safety problem with COVID-19 vaccines.""
About 20 minutes into his video, Nepute also claims that COVID-19 cases have dropped ""because they’ve already changed the testing.""
""That happened on Inauguration Day, the World Health Organization said, stop the PCR testing, start switching to antibody testing,"" he claims.
That’s false. As we’ve previously explained, the WHO’s notice on Jan. 20 was a memo to lab professionals about the proper use of PCR tests. It was distorted on social media, with dubious websites wrongly claiming the guidance represented a massive change in testing protocol.

Airlines are encouraging people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to fly once again. Yet social media posts falsely claim that airline executives around the world are discussing banning vaccinated passengers due to a risk of blood clotting at high altitudes. Experts say there is no evidence of an added risk of blood clots for vaccinated air travelers.

    
      
      
        
          
                          
                  
              
                        
              How do we know vaccines are safe?            
          
        
      

      
    
        
          
            
              How do we know vaccines are safe?
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
              
            
              No vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.
One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS ""is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.""
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists.
Another monitoring system is the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.
In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events.

Full Story
After a steep decline in air travel in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the severe impact on the industry, airlines are trying to make it easier for vaccinated travelers to fly — and providing rewards for doing so.
For example, American Airlines is offering a mobile app that makes it easier for travelers to verify that they are vaccinated and ready to fly before they arrive at the airport. 
United Airlines is hosting a ""Your Shot to Fly"" sweepstakes. Every day in June, a COVID-19 vaccinated United member has a chance to win a free roundtrip flight for two; five people will win yearlong passes.  
But a viral Instagram video falsely claims airlines are considering grounding passengers who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. ""Airline Executives around the world are now meeting to begin discussions as to the banning of those vaccinated from travelling on airplanes due to the threat of blood clots at high altitudes,"" reads the text on the post. 
""Airlines in Spain and Russia are warning people who have been vaccinated against coronavirus not to travel because of the risk of blood clots,"" says a reporter in the video. ""Well, this is a well-known risk of long-haul flights, but it apparently is exacerbated by the potential side effects, the clotting side effects, of the COVID-19 vaccine.""

The post was shared by Shannon Kroner, who has spread other false claims about COVID-19 vaccines, as we’ve reported. 
Posts falsely claiming that there is a risk for vaccinated air travelers have been shared on Instagram since late May. ""Airlines are meeting today to discuss the risks of carrying vaxed passengers due to the risk of clots and the liabilities involved,"" reads a similar post with more than 4,000 likes. ""Oh the irony only the non vaxed can fly.""
Contrary to these posts, there is no evidence of airline executives meeting to discuss the risk of blood clots or banning vaccinated travelers.
Kalliopi Lazari, a spokesperson for the International Air Transport Association, or IATA, said in an email to FactCheck.org that the organization is not aware of any airlines considering a ban on vaccinated passengers due to a blood-clot risk. 
""We advocate that people who have been vaccinated should be free to travel without restriction,"" Lazari said.
Responding to the claim in the video about airlines in Spain, a spokesperson for Iberia, Spain’s flag carrier airline, told us in an email, ""It is completely false that Iberia has made any similar recommendation. Like all European airlines, we apply the [European Union Aviation Safety Agency] and [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] recommendations.""
 Those agencies issued a joint document on June 17 on updated safety protocols for airlines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The agencies’ press release on the guidelines states: ""In line with current scientific evidence and the European Council recommendation, the Protocol proposes that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or who recovered from the disease in the last 180 days should not be subject to testing or quarantine, unless they are coming from an area of very high risk or where a Variant of Concern is circulating.""
No Evidence of Risk from COVID-19 Vaccine
Contrary to the viral posts, medical experts say there is no evidence that vaccinated travelers face an increased risk for blood clots at high altitudes due to the COVID-19 vaccine. 
""This sounds patently false. I would not have any concerns about vaccinated individuals traveling by air,"" Dr. Adam Cuker, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email. Cuker’s research and clinical expertise is in blood clotting and bleeding disorders.  ""I am not aware of any evidence of an increased risk of thrombosis in [vaccinated] individuals with air travel.""
Unrelated to vaccines, long-distance travelers can develop a type of blood clot known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, after extended periods of immobility. The risk of DVT during sedentary travel has been a concern of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
A DVT typically forms in the leg and is more common than the 36 rare blood clot cases in the United States that have been associated with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. The individuals in those rare cases suffered from a combination of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, and low levels of blood platelets, a condition known as thrombocytopenia.
CVST forms in the brain and can possibly lead to a stroke. Experts have given the condition linked to the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines the name vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT. 
""We do have a medical advisory group that looks at health and air travel issues. This is not an issue on their agenda,"" Lazari, of the International Air Transport Association, said of the claims circulating on Instagram about vaccinated travelers. ""We are also not aware of any suggestion in medical literature that the particular blood clot phenomenon (known as Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia or VITT), which has been designated as a rare side effect of one or possibly two types of COVID vaccines, has any impact on air travel.""  
""The blood clot phenomenon (Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia or VITT) is a different disorder from blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and/or lung (pulmonary embolism) which can be associated with immobility, in particular following surgery, limb injury, bed-rest, or sometimes prolonged sitting during travel,"" Lazari said.
""Aside from immobility, there are many risk factors including pregnancy, oral contraceptives, certain cancers, being overweight, varicose veins, and underlying disorders of the clotting system. Cases which occur in association with long-distance travel (air, rail or road) usually have pre-existing risk factors such as these, and those who are known to be susceptible can be prescribed medication to reduce their risk,"" Lazari also said.
The CDC says abnormal blood clots in veins and arteries are associated with COVID-19. ""In some people with COVID-19, we’re seeing a massive inflammatory response, the cytokine storm that raises clotting factors in the blood,"" Panagis Galiatsatos, a specialist in lung diseases and critical care at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said in a November blog post.
The CDC recommends that individuals should not travel internationally until they are fully vaccinated.

		FactCheck.org Managing Editor Lori Robertson spoke with WHYY radio in Philadelphia about fact-checking the White House’s daily coronavirus task force briefings.
She was a guest on WHYY’s ""Radio Times"" on April 15 for a discussion on fact-checking and the challenge  for the media in covering these briefings live, along with Mark Lukasiewicz, a former senior executive at NBC News and ABC News.
Robertson discussed several recent FactCheck.org articles debunking claims President Donald Trump had made in these briefings. For instance, constitutional experts say Trump was wrong that he, not governors, had the power to ""open up the states"" where businesses were closed or residents were ordered to stay at home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also made false statements about the drug hydroxychloroquine. Trump claimed ""studies"" had suggested there are few novel coronavirus cases in ""malaria countries"" because of the use of hydroxychloroquine as an antimalarial drug. But FactCheck.org found no such studies exist, and the drug is not widely used for malaria in much of the world. Similarly, he falsely claimed ""people with lupus,"" who also take hydroxychloroquine to treat symptoms of their disease, ""aren’t catching this horrible virus."" In fact, people with lupus have reported contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Robertson also discussed why FactCheck.org doesn’t use the word ""lie"" to label political falsehoods. A ""lie"" describes an intention to deceive, and we can’t prove someone’s intent. We don’t know whether a politician was mistaken or believed he or she was correct, for instance.
The full interview is available on WHYY’s website and Apple podcast.
