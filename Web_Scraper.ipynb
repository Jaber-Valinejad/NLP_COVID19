Janssenâ€™s lead SARS-CoV-2 investigational vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2.S, prevented severe clinical disease in Syrian golden hamsters, upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in people. The data, published today in  , demonstrated that the Companyâ€™s investigational adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccine elicited an immune response as demonstrated by â€œneutralizing antibodiesâ€ and prevented severe clinical disease â€“ including weight loss, pneumonia and mortality â€“ in Syrian golden hamsters upon challenge. This publication follows Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s recent   that its vaccine candidate elicited an immune response in a pre-clinical study in non-human primates (NHP), that correlated with protection against SARS-CoV-2, providing complete protection against viral replication in the lungs. The latest research tested the vaccine candidate in Syrian golden hamsters, as they are more susceptible to clinical disease than NHPs, which typically do not get severe disease. â€œThis pre-clinical study further validates our confidence in our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate,â€ said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. â€œWith our Phase 3 trials planned to start this month, we remain committed to expanding our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to enable global access to our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate should it prove to be safe and effective in humans.â€ The pre-clinical studies were conducted by researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in collaboration with the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and others as part of its ongoing   to accelerate the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In the pre-clinical study, researchers first immunized Syrian golden hamsters with a single injection of the Ad26-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which induced neutralizing antibodies in all the vaccinated animals. Four weeks later, the animals were exposed to a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 virus. These vaccinated animals lost less weight and had less virus in their lungs and other organs than unvaccinated control animals. Mortalities were absent in vaccinated animals. Moreover, the researchers found that neutralizing antibody responses were inversely correlated with weight loss and viral replication in the lung.  Ad26.COV2.S is currently being evaluated in clinical studies to establish the performance of the vaccine candidate in humans.

Janssenâ€™s lead SARS-CoV-2 investigational vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2.S, prevented severe clinical disease in Syrian golden hamsters, upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in people. The data, published today in  , demonstrated that the Companyâ€™s investigational adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccine elicited an immune response as demonstrated by â€œneutralizing antibodiesâ€ and prevented severe clinical disease â€“ including weight loss, pneumonia and mortality â€“ in Syrian golden hamsters upon challenge. This publication follows Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s recent   that its vaccine candidate elicited an immune response in a pre-clinical study in non-human primates (NHP), that correlated with protection against SARS-CoV-2, providing complete protection against viral replication in the lungs. The latest research tested the vaccine candidate in Syrian golden hamsters, as they are more susceptible to clinical disease than NHPs, which typically do not get severe disease. â€œThis pre-clinical study further validates our confidence in our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate,â€ said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. â€œWith our Phase 3 trials planned to start this month, we remain committed to expanding our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to enable global access to our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate should it prove to be safe and effective in humans.â€ The pre-clinical studies were conducted by researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in collaboration with the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and others as part of its ongoing   to accelerate the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In the pre-clinical study, researchers first immunized Syrian golden hamsters with a single injection of the Ad26-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which induced neutralizing antibodies in all the vaccinated animals. Four weeks later, the animals were exposed to a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 virus. These vaccinated animals lost less weight and had less virus in their lungs and other organs than unvaccinated control animals. Mortalities were absent in vaccinated animals. Moreover, the researchers found that neutralizing antibody responses were inversely correlated with weight loss and viral replication in the lung.  Ad26.COV2.S is currently being evaluated in clinical studies to establish the performance of the vaccine candidate in humans.

Ahmad, MPH ; Paul Sutton, PhD ; Robert N. Anderson, PhD  ( ) As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the United States; however, this might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25â€“44 years and among Hispanic or Latino persons. These results inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care. Â  As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States*; however, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause ( â€“ ).  Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26â€“October 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDCâ€™s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) ( ). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015â€“2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25â€“44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care. Estimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limited by factors such as the availability and use of diagnostic testing (including postmortem testing) and the accurate and complete reporting of cause of death information on the death certificate. Excess death analyses are not subject to these limitations because they examine historical trends in all-cause mortality to determine the degree to which observed numbers of deaths differ from historical norms. In April 2020, CDCâ€™s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) began publishing data on excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic ( , ). This report describes trends and demographic patterns in the number of excess deaths occurring in the United States from January 26, 2020, through October 3, 2020, and differences by age and race/ethnicity using provisional mortality data from the NVSS. Excess deaths are typically defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. A detailed description of the methodology for estimating excess deaths has been described previously ( ). Briefly, expected numbers of deaths are estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns. The average expected number, as well as the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval (the range of values likely to contain the value of a single new observation), are used as thresholds to determine the number of excess deaths (i.e., observed numbers above each threshold) and percentage excess (excess deaths divided by average expected number of deaths). Estimates described here refer to the number or percentage above the average; estimates above the upper bound threshold have been published elsewhere ( ). Observed numbers of deaths are weighted to account for incomplete reporting by jurisdictions (50 states and the District of Columbia [DC]) in the most recent weeks, where the weights were estimated based on completeness of provisional data in the past year ( ). Weekly NVSS data on excess deaths occurring from January 26 (the week ending February 1), 2020, through October 3, 2020, were used to quantify the number of excess deaths and the percentage excess for deaths from all causes and deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19.  Deaths attributed to COVID-19 have the   code U07.1 as an underlying or contributing cause of death. Weekly numbers of deaths by age group (0â€“24, 25â€“44, 45â€“64, 65â€“74, 75â€“84, and â‰¥85 years) and race/ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], non-Hispanic White [White], non-Hispanic Black or African American [Black], non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN], and other/unknown race/ethnicity, which included non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic multiracial, and unknown) were used to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015â€“2019. These values were used to calculate an average percentage change in 2020 (i.e., above or below average compared with past years), over the period of analysis, by age group and race and Hispanic ethnicity. NVSS data in this report include all deaths occurring in the 50 states and DC and are not limited to U.S. residents. Approximately 0.2% of decedents overall are foreign residents. R statistical software (version 3.5.0; The R Foundation) was used to conduct all analyses. From January 26, 2020, through October 3, 2020, an estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died in the United States.** Excess deaths reached their highest points to date during the weeks ending April 11 (40.4% excess) and August 8, 2020 (23.5% excess) ( ). Two thirds of excess deaths during the analysis period (66.2%; 198,081) were attributed to COVID-19 and the remaining third to other causes  (Figure 1). The total number of excess deaths (deaths above average levels) from January 26 through October 3 ranged from a low of approximately 841 in the youngest age group (<25 years) to a high of 94,646 among adults aged 75â€“84 years.  However, the average percentage change in deaths over this period compared with previous years was largest for adults aged 25â€“44 years (26.5%) ( ). Overall, numbers of deaths among persons aged <25 years were 2.0% below average,  and among adults aged 45â€“64, 65â€“74 years, 75â€“84, and â‰¥85 years were 14.4%, 24.1%, 21.5%, and 14.7% above average, respectively. When examined by race and ethnicity, the total numbers of excess deaths during the analysis period ranged from a low of approximately 3,412 among AI/AN persons to a high of 171,491 among White persons. For White persons, deaths were 11.9% higher when compared to average numbers during 2015â€“2019. However, some racial and ethnic subgroups experienced disproportionately higher percentage increases in deaths ( ). Specifically, the average percentage increase over this period was largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%). Deaths were 28.9% above average for AI/AN persons, 32.9% above average for Black persons, 34.6% above average for those of other or unknown race or ethnicity, and 36.6% above average for Asian persons. Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died since January 26, 2020; approximately two thirds of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September ( ). Although more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25â€“44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August ( ); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%â€“36.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.*** The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week. A range of values for excess death estimates is provided elsewhere ( ), but these ranges might not reflect all of the sources of uncertainty, such as the completeness of provisional data. Third, different methods or models for estimating the expected numbers of deaths might lead to different results. Estimates of the number or percentage of deaths above average levels by race/ethnicity and age reported here might not sum to the total numbers of excess deaths reported elsewhere, which might have been estimated using different methodologies. Fourth, using the average numbers of deaths from past years might underestimate the total expected numbers because of population growth or aging, or because of increasing trends in certain causes such as drug overdose mortality. Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19â€“related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic. Specifically, deaths from circulatory diseases, Alzheimer disease and dementia, and respiratory diseases have increased in 2020 relative to past years ( ), and it is unclear to what extent these represent misclassified COVID-19 deaths or deaths indirectly related to the pandemic (e.g., because of disruptions in health care access or utilization). Despite these limitations, however, this report demonstrates important trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results provide more information about deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform public health messaging and mitigation efforts focused on the prevention of infection and mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the elimination of health inequities. CDC continues to recommend the use of masks, frequent handwashing, and maintenance of social distancing to prevent COVID-19. Corresponding author: Lauren M. Rossen,  .

Deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 are calculated by subtracting the number of confirmed or presumed COVID-19 deaths from the total number of deaths. Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 are assigned the   code U07.1 as a contributing or underlying cause of death on the death certificate. ** Excess deaths over this period ranged from 224,173 to 299,028. The lower end of this range corresponds to the total number above the upper bound of the 95% prediction intervals, and the upper end of the range corresponds to the total number above the average expected counts. Deaths above the upper bound threshold are significantly higher than expected.  .  Excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 were calculated by subtracting the number of excess deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 from the total number of excess deaths from all causes. These excess death estimates were based on the numbers of deaths above the average expected number. Using the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval for the expected numbers (the upper bound threshold), an estimated 224,173 excess deaths occurred during this period, 85.5% of which were attributed to COVID-19.  Weeks when the observed numbers of deaths were below the average numbers from 2015 to 2019 were excluded from the total numbers of excess deaths above average levels (i.e., negative values were treated as 0 excess deaths).  The total average percentage change in the number of deaths occurring from the week ending February 1, 2020, through October 3, 2020, included weeks where the percentage difference was negative (i.e., deaths were fewer than expected). This mainly affected the youngest age group, among whom, overall, deaths during this period were 2.0% below average. Excluding weeks with negative numbers of excess deaths results in overall percentage increases of 4.2% for decedents aged <25 years. Increases for other age groups were similar when excluding weeks with negative numbers of excess deaths, with the exception of those aged â‰¥85 years, among whom the percentage increase was larger (18.1%) when weeks with negative values were excluded. ***  .   .

Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25â€“44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care. Estimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limited by factors such as the availability and use of diagnostic testing (including postmortem testing) and the accurate and complete reporting of cause of death information on the death certificate. Excess death analyses are not subject to these limitations because they examine historical trends in all-cause mortality to determine the degree to which observed numbers of deaths differ from historical norms. In April 2020, CDCâ€™s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) began publishing data on excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic ( , ). This report describes trends and demographic patterns in the number of excess deaths occurring in the United States from January 26, 2020, through October 3, 2020, and differences by age and race/ethnicity using provisional mortality data from the NVSS. Excess deaths are typically defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. A detailed description of the methodology for estimating excess deaths has been described previously ( ). Briefly, expected numbers of deaths are estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns. The average expected number, as well as the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval (the range of values likely to contain the value of a single new observation), are used as thresholds to determine the number of excess deaths (i.e., observed numbers above each threshold) and percentage excess (excess deaths divided by average expected number of deaths). Estimates described here refer to the number or percentage above the average; estimates above the upper bound threshold have been published elsewhere ( ). Observed numbers of deaths are weighted to account for incomplete reporting by jurisdictions (50 states and the District of Columbia [DC]) in the most recent weeks, where the weights were estimated based on completeness of provisional data in the past year ( ). Weekly NVSS data on excess deaths occurring from January 26 (the week ending February 1), 2020, through October 3, 2020, were used to quantify the number of excess deaths and the percentage excess for deaths from all causes and deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19.  Deaths attributed to COVID-19 have the   code U07.1 as an underlying or contributing cause of death. Weekly numbers of deaths by age group (0â€“24, 25â€“44, 45â€“64, 65â€“74, 75â€“84, and â‰¥85 years) and race/ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], non-Hispanic White [White], non-Hispanic Black or African American [Black], non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN], and other/unknown race/ethnicity, which included non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic multiracial, and unknown) were used to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015â€“2019. These values were used to calculate an average percentage change in 2020 (i.e., above or below average compared with past years), over the period of analysis, by age group and race and Hispanic ethnicity. NVSS data in this report include all deaths occurring in the 50 states and DC and are not limited to U.S. residents. Approximately 0.2% of decedents overall are foreign residents. R statistical software (version 3.5.0; The R Foundation) was used to conduct all analyses. From January 26, 2020, through October 3, 2020, an estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died in the United States.** Excess deaths reached their highest points to date during the weeks ending April 11 (40.4% excess) and August 8, 2020 (23.5% excess) ( ). Two thirds of excess deaths during the analysis period (66.2%; 198,081) were attributed to COVID-19 and the remaining third to other causes  (Figure 1). The total number of excess deaths (deaths above average levels) from January 26 through October 3 ranged from a low of approximately 841 in the youngest age group (<25 years) to a high of 94,646 among adults aged 75â€“84 years.  However, the average percentage change in deaths over this period compared with previous years was largest for adults aged 25â€“44 years (26.5%) ( ). Overall, numbers of deaths among persons aged <25 years were 2.0% below average,  and among adults aged 45â€“64, 65â€“74 years, 75â€“84, and â‰¥85 years were 14.4%, 24.1%, 21.5%, and 14.7% above average, respectively. When examined by race and ethnicity, the total numbers of excess deaths during the analysis period ranged from a low of approximately 3,412 among AI/AN persons to a high of 171,491 among White persons. For White persons, deaths were 11.9% higher when compared to average numbers during 2015â€“2019. However, some racial and ethnic subgroups experienced disproportionately higher percentage increases in deaths ( ). Specifically, the average percentage increase over this period was largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%). Deaths were 28.9% above average for AI/AN persons, 32.9% above average for Black persons, 34.6% above average for those of other or unknown race or ethnicity, and 36.6% above average for Asian persons. Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died since January 26, 2020; approximately two thirds of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September ( ). Although more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25â€“44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August ( ); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%â€“36.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.*** The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week. A range of values for excess death estimates is provided elsewhere ( ), but these ranges might not reflect all of the sources of uncertainty, such as the completeness of provisional data. Third, different methods or models for estimating the expected numbers of deaths might lead to different results. Estimates of the number or percentage of deaths above average levels by race/ethnicity and age reported here might not sum to the total numbers of excess deaths reported elsewhere, which might have been estimated using different methodologies. Fourth, using the average numbers of deaths from past years might underestimate the total expected numbers because of population growth or aging, or because of increasing trends in certain causes such as drug overdose mortality. Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19â€“related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic. Specifically, deaths from circulatory diseases, Alzheimer disease and dementia, and respiratory diseases have increased in 2020 relative to past years ( ), and it is unclear to what extent these represent misclassified COVID-19 deaths or deaths indirectly related to the pandemic (e.g., because of disruptions in health care access or utilization). Despite these limitations, however, this report demonstrates important trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results provide more information about deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform public health messaging and mitigation efforts focused on the prevention of infection and mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the elimination of health inequities. CDC continues to recommend the use of masks, frequent handwashing, and maintenance of social distancing to prevent COVID-19. Corresponding author: Lauren M. Rossen,  .

Deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 are calculated by subtracting the number of confirmed or presumed COVID-19 deaths from the total number of deaths. Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19 are assigned the   code U07.1 as a contributing or underlying cause of death on the death certificate. ** Excess deaths over this period ranged from 224,173 to 299,028. The lower end of this range corresponds to the total number above the upper bound of the 95% prediction intervals, and the upper end of the range corresponds to the total number above the average expected counts. Deaths above the upper bound threshold are significantly higher than expected.  .  Excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 were calculated by subtracting the number of excess deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 from the total number of excess deaths from all causes. These excess death estimates were based on the numbers of deaths above the average expected number. Using the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval for the expected numbers (the upper bound threshold), an estimated 224,173 excess deaths occurred during this period, 85.5% of which were attributed to COVID-19.  Weeks when the observed numbers of deaths were below the average numbers from 2015 to 2019 were excluded from the total numbers of excess deaths above average levels (i.e., negative values were treated as 0 excess deaths).  The total average percentage change in the number of deaths occurring from the week ending February 1, 2020, through October 3, 2020, included weeks where the percentage difference was negative (i.e., deaths were fewer than expected). This mainly affected the youngest age group, among whom, overall, deaths during this period were 2.0% below average. Excluding weeks with negative numbers of excess deaths results in overall percentage increases of 4.2% for decedents aged <25 years. Increases for other age groups were similar when excluding weeks with negative numbers of excess deaths, with the exception of those aged â‰¥85 years, among whom the percentage increase was larger (18.1%) when weeks with negative values were excluded. ***  .   .

His plans cover a range of policy goals: Lifting the economy out of the COVID-19 recession; restoring blue collar jobs; beefing up critical U.S. infrastructure; levying higher taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans; securing affordable child care for American families. The first-term Democrat's vision to reshape the U.S. economy has come in the form of three broad fiscal programs, each bearing a three-letter acronym distinguished from one another only by their middle initials: The ARP (American Rescue Plan); the AJP (American Jobs Plan); and AFP (American Families Plan). Here's where they stand: ARP: American Rescue Plan - $1.9 trillion Status: Passed The first of Biden's proposals, floated before he was sworn into office on Jan. 20, is the only of the three so far to have been enacted into law. It passed in March on party-line votes, backed by Democrats, rejected by Republicans. Its signature components were $1,400 one-time payments that went out to most American households this spring and the extension of a $300 a week federal enhancement to state unemployment benefits until September. Those funds helped lift consumer spending in the first quarter at an annualized rate of 10.7%, among the largest gains in the post-World War Two era.  The ARP also included funds to accelerate the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and to assist the businesses and communities most affected by the pandemic.   The United States has emerged as one of the world leaders in the COVID-19 inoculation effort, with 43% of U.S. adults having gotten at least one dose of vaccine and 30% now fully vaccinated. AJP: American Jobs Plan - $2.3 trillion Status: Blueprint Biden announced what he bills as his \"blue collar blueprint\" at the end of March, and while it has been the focus of much discussion in Washington, no formal proposal has yet surfaced on Capitol Hill. The plan's two biggest buckets - at $650 billion each - would: * Fund traditional public transportation projects like roads and bridges while underwriting investments in the infrastructure to kick the transition to electric vehicles into high gear; and * Pay to refurbish aging public schools and decaying public water systems and expand broadband access for the 35% of rural Americans lacking such high-speed communications connectivity. Other components of the AJP would provide funds for home- or community-based care for the elderly and disabled and would invest in domestic manufacturing for industries the Biden administration considers critical to the national interest, such as semiconductors and green energy. To pay for these, Biden has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%; eliminating all fossil fuel industry subsidies and loopholes; and establishing a minimum tax on income companies use to report profits to investors. AFP: American Families Plan - $1.8 trillion Status: Blueprint The last of Biden's proposals is a mix of new spending, totaling $1 trillion, and tax credits for working families, about $800 billion. It went up the flagpole in late April and features his first stab at getting the wealthiest Americans to pay more in taxes. Like the AJP, it has yet to get as far as a formal bill before Congress. Its key spending elements include provisions: * Aiming to help working parents cover childcare expenses and subsidizing daycare costs for families with kids under 5 and provide free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. * Providing free community college tuition; boosting a federal tuition grant program; and subsidizing tuition for students from middle-class families attending an historically Black college or university, or HBCU. * Extending the child tax credit, included in the ARP enacted in March, through 2025. The current credit, essentially another monthly payment from the government for most families, will sunset at the end of this year. * Roughly doubling the tax rate paid by high earners on their investment income to 39.6% from 20% now and lifting the highest tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%.

Mask effectiveness varies, but claims that cloth masks provide 0% protection arenâ€™t accurate. More studies need to be done to examine variables such as the material and fit of the mask, the wearer, and the environment. Health officials largely agree that wearing any kind of face mask, coupled with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, is more protective than going unmasked.

Half of the award will be shared by two French virologists, FranÃ§oise BarrÃ©-Sinoussi, 61, and Luc A. Montagnier, 76, for discovering H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Conspicuously omitted was Dr. Robert C. Gallo, an American virologist who vied with the French team in a long, often acrimonious dispute over credit for the discovery of H.I.V.  The other half of the $1.4 million award will go to a German physician-scientist, Dr. Harald zur Hausen, 72, for his discovery of H.P.V., or the human papilloma virus. Dr. zur Hausen of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg â€œwent against current dogmaâ€ by postulating that the virus caused cervical cancer, said the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which selects the medical winners of the prize, formally called the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  His discovery led to the development of two vaccines against cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women. An estimated 250,000 women die of cervical cancer each year, mostly in poor countries. This yearâ€™s Nobel Prize-winning research focused on two viruses that take many years to cause damage. Much of the research was carried out a quarter of a century or more ago. Since its discovery in 1981, AIDS has rivaled the worst epidemics in history. An estimated 25 million people have died, and 33 million more are living with H.I.V. In 1983, Dr. Montagnier and Dr. BarrÃ©-Sinoussi, a member of his lab at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, published their report of a newly identified virus. The Karolinska Institute said that discovery led to blood tests to detect the infection and to anti-retroviral drugs that can prolong the lives of patients. The tests are now used to screen blood donations, making the blood supply safer for transfusions and blood products. The viral discovery has also led to an understanding of the natural history of H.I.V. infection in people, which ultimately leads to AIDS and death unless treated. H.I.V. is a member of the lentivirus family of viruses. The French scientists were cited for identifying a virus they called L.A.V. (now known as H.I.V.) in lymph nodes from early and late stages of the infection. â€œNever before has science and medicine been so quick to discover, identify the origin and provide treatment for a new disease entity,â€ the Karolinska Institute said. Reached by the Nobel committee in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where he is attending an international AIDS conference, Dr. Montagnier said, â€œThe fight is not finishedâ€ and he was now working on a way to eradicate H.I.V. in those already infected. Dr. Montagnier now works at the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention in Paris. For a brief time in the late 1990s, he worked at Queens College in New York City. Nobel Foundation rules limit the number of recipients of its medical prizes to a maximum of three each year, and omissions often create controversy. The dispute between Dr. Gallo and the French team spanned years and sprawled from the lab into the highest levels of government. Dr. Gallo, 71, now at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, worked for many years at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.  While in Bethesda in 1984, a year after the French teamâ€™s report, Dr. Gallo reported finding a virus that he called H.T.L.V.-3 and that was later shown to be nearly identical to the French L.A.V. After additional studies, Dr. Gallo said cultures in his laboratory had accidentally become contaminated with the French virus. In 1986, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Montagnier shared a prestigious Lasker award, given in the United States; Dr. Montagnier was cited for discovering the virus and Dr. Gallo for determining that it caused AIDS. In 1987, President Reagan and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France signed an agreement to share royalties and credit for the discovery. But Maria Masucci, a member of the Nobel Assembly, told Reuters on Monday that â€œthere was no doubt as to who made the fundamental discoveries.â€ Dr. Gallo told The Associated Press on Monday that it was â€œa disappointmentâ€ not to have been honored with the French team. Later, Dr. Gallo issued a statement congratulating this yearâ€™s Nobel Prize winners and said he â€œwas gratified to read Dr. Montagnierâ€™s kind statement this morning expressing that I was equally deserving.â€  Dr. John E. Niederhuber, the director of the National Cancer Institute, said Monday that Dr. Gallo â€œwas instrumental in every major aspect of the discovery of the AIDS virus. Dr. Gallo discovered interleukein-2 (Il-2), an immune system signaling molecule, which was necessary for the discovery of the AIDS virus, serving as a co-culture factor that allowed the virus to grow. Numerous scientific journal articles, many co-authored by Dr. Gallo and Dr. Montagnier, cite the two scientists as co-discoverers of the AIDS virus.â€ Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a virologist and immunologist who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview, â€œThe committee has a long history of awarding the prize to the person or group that makes the first seminal observation or discovery, and they did that in this case.â€ He added, â€œNobel Prizes are always associated with great joy and great sadness, depending on who wins and who you are.â€ The link between human papilloma virus and cervical cancer took years to gain acceptance. When Dr. zur Hausen proposed the connection in the 1970s, infection with papilloma virus was thought to cause nothing more serious than common warts, and the prevailing scientific view was that herpes type 2 virus caused cervical cancer. But Dr. zur Hausen consistently failed to find herpes type 2 DNA in cervical cancer cells using the newer molecular biology laboratory techniques. In the 1980s, an American researcher said that financing agencies in the United States had rejected as unpromising his grant proposals to study links between papilloma viruses and cancer. The National Institutes of Health did not reply on Monday to questions about such proposals. In 1983, Dr. zur Hausen discovered the first H.P.V., type 16, among biopsies of women who had cervical cancer. He went on to show that more than one H.P.V. type could lead to cervical cancer, in part by cloning H.P.V. 16 and another type, 18. Further research has shown that the two H.P.V. types are consistently found in about 70 percent of cervical cancer biopsies throughout the world, the institute said. Of the more than 100 human papilloma viruses now known, about 40 infect the genital tract and 15 of them put women at high risk for cervical cancer. But in a vast majority of cases, the bodyâ€™s immune system clears H.P.V. before the viruses cause harm. It is chronic infection that is dangerous. H.P.V. viruses account for more than 5 percent of all cancers worldwide. Some types of H.P.V. are found in cancers of the vulva, penis, mouth and other areas. Other H.P.V. viruses cause warts on the foot and elsewhere. Dr. zur Hausenâ€™s research has led to development of vaccines that protect against strains of H.P.V. that cause most cases of cervical cancers. However, controversy has arisen over who should get the vaccines.  The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved one papilloma virus vaccine, Gardasil, for girls and women ages 9 to 26 and with advice that they get immunized before sexual activity begins. Because the vaccine was developed recently, doctors do not know for how long it will last. The Nobel Prizes were created in the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish explosives inventor and manufacturer, who died in 1896. The first prizes were awarded in 1901.

Half of the award will be shared by two French virologists, FranÃ§oise BarrÃ©-Sinoussi, 61, and Luc A. Montagnier, 76, for discovering H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Conspicuously omitted was Dr. Robert C. Gallo, an American virologist who vied with the French team in a long, often acrimonious dispute over credit for the discovery of H.I.V.  The other half of the $1.4 million award will go to a German physician-scientist, Dr. Harald zur Hausen, 72, for his discovery of H.P.V., or the human papilloma virus. Dr. zur Hausen of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg â€œwent against current dogmaâ€ by postulating that the virus caused cervical cancer, said the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which selects the medical winners of the prize, formally called the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  His discovery led to the development of two vaccines against cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women. An estimated 250,000 women die of cervical cancer each year, mostly in poor countries. This yearâ€™s Nobel Prize-winning research focused on two viruses that take many years to cause damage. Much of the research was carried out a quarter of a century or more ago. Since its discovery in 1981, AIDS has rivaled the worst epidemics in history. An estimated 25 million people have died, and 33 million more are living with H.I.V. In 1983, Dr. Montagnier and Dr. BarrÃ©-Sinoussi, a member of his lab at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, published their report of a newly identified virus. The Karolinska Institute said that discovery led to blood tests to detect the infection and to anti-retroviral drugs that can prolong the lives of patients.

Whiteâ€¦ \n","Y2 In these unprecedented times, youÂ want and need reliable information. Weâ€™re committed to giving it to you. Thatâ€™s why the controversy surroundingÂ a Detroit News opinion piece last week deserves analysis and explanation. In the end, it illustrates the essential role that newspapers play in providing checks and balances on government in a crisis. The piece, entitled â€œ ,â€ was written by Kathy Hoekstra, and published on our website's opinion sectionÂ on Thursday. Hoekstra isÂ a former mid-Michigan broadcaster well known in Michigan journalism and communications circles. Her well-documented commentary reflected on a letter issued by the stateâ€™s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) to pharmacists and doctors, warning about allegations of doctors prescribing and hoarding two controversial medications â€” hydroxychloroquine andÂ chloroquine â€”Â for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Â  These two drugs were top of mind last week, as President Donald Trump hailed their potential and his chief infectious diseases adviser warned that they were not yet medically proven. LARAâ€™s letter, however, went well beyond a prohibition of hoarding. â€œ or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortageâ€ for patients with ailments for which the drug is approved, the letter said (emphasis added).Â â€œReports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action. â€œAgain,â€ the letter went on, â€œthese are drugs that have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.â€ There was no question of the facts. Hoekstraâ€™s opinion was equally clear: Threatening doctors and pharmacistsÂ against using the drugs was a quizzical, heavy-handed approach that could cost lives. Hospitals, she pointed out,Â already were using these drugs to treat COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, the column was picked up by other outlets and on social media channels, with many assigning their own political spin. Four full days after LARAâ€™s initial letter (but less than a day after the column was published), the department ostensibly clarified itself. In a second letter, it repeated the warning against hoarding and included statements from medical associations. But it never backtracked on the threat to physicians and pharmacists about prescribing these drugs for COVID-19,  .Â  On Monday, LARA alerted its licensees that the FDA late last week authorized the emergency use of these drugs to fight the virus. It took an explanation from Senate Majority LeaderÂ Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, to understand what happened. He asked the governor to issue the originalÂ letter toÂ make clear that people shouldnâ€™t hoardÂ these drugs. \"We needed something to prevent cloroquine from becoming the next toilet paper,\" Shirkey told me. \"I quickly requested of her staff that they put something out, and somehow in the translation it was prohibiting use of these drugsÂ -- and that wasn't the intent.\" \"I was grateful for your article ... because it was the first thing that alerted me that it was screwed up.\" In the meantime, the governorâ€™s office took umbrage with the piece and The News. â€œYou know, one wacky idea would be to just ... not run crazy s--- on your opinion page during the worst global pandemic in 100 years,â€ Whitmerâ€™s communications director Zack Pohl wrote me Saturday. â€œWhat qualifications does Kathy Hoekstra have? Is she a lawyer? Is she a physician? Who pays her salary? What exactly is her expertise here? If you don't immediately know the answers to these questions, how can you expect your readers to? And that seems like a problem.â€Â  The problem was neither the credentials of the writer nor the opinion she expressed. Nor was it The Newsâ€™ standards for allowing her to express them. This was not fake news, as critics of the piece alleged. It was public service journalism. LARA's original letter created fear among physicians desperate to treat patients dying of the virus. That confusion was caused byÂ miscommunication between branches of state government. It had the real potential to cost the lives of real MichiganiansÂ in real time.Â  And it has been clarified because of that opinion piece in The News. Weâ€™ll take the heat, gladly, because thatâ€™s exactly the kind of thing weâ€™re here to do. \n","text1 I quickly requested of (Whitmerâ€™s) staff that they put something out, and somehow in the translation it was prohibiting use of these drugs â€” and that wasn't the intent.

Keep America great Trump Pence 2020, \n","text2 In these unprecedented times, youÂ want and need reliable information. Weâ€™re committed to giving it to you. Thatâ€™s why the controversy surroundingÂ a Detroit News opinion piece last week deserves analysis and explanation. In the end, it illustrates the essential role that newspapers play in providing checks and balances on government in a crisis. The piece, entitled â€œ ,â€ was written by Kathy Hoekstra, and published on our website's opinion sectionÂ on Thursday. Hoekstra isÂ a former mid-Michigan broadcaster well known in Michigan journalism and communications circles. Her well-documented commentary reflected on a letter issued by the stateâ€™s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) to pharmacists and doctors, warning about allegations of doctors prescribing and hoarding two controversial medications â€” hydroxychloroquine andÂ chloroquine â€”Â for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Â  These two drugs were top of mind last week, as President Donald Trump hailed their potential and his chief infectious diseases adviser warned that they were not yet medically proven. LARAâ€™s letter, however, went well beyond a prohibition of hoarding. â€œ or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortageâ€ for patients with ailments for which the drug is approved, the letter said (emphasis added).Â â€œReports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action. â€œAgain,â€ the letter went on, â€œthese are drugs that have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.â€ There was no question of the facts. Hoekstraâ€™s opinion was equally clear: Threatening doctors and pharmacistsÂ against using the drugs was a quizzical, heavy-handed approach that could cost lives. Hospitals, she pointed out,Â already were using these drugs to treat COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, the column was picked up by other outlets and on social media channels, with many assigning their own political spin. Four full days after LARAâ€™s initial letter (but less than a day after the column was published), the department ostensibly clarified itself. In a second letter, it repeated the warning against hoarding and included statements from medical associations. But it never backtracked on the threat to physicians and pharmacists about prescribing these drugs for COVID-19,  .Â  On Monday, LARA alerted its licensees that the FDA late last week authorized the emergency use of these drugs to fight the virus. It took an explanation from Senate Majority LeaderÂ Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, to understand what happened. He asked the governor to issue the originalÂ letter toÂ make clear that people shouldnâ€™t hoardÂ these drugs. \"We needed something to prevent cloroquine from becoming the next toilet paper,\" Shirkey told me. \"I quickly requested of her staff that they put something out, and somehow in the translation it was prohibiting use of these drugsÂ -- and that wasn't the intent.\" \"I was grateful for your article ... because it was the first thing that alerted me that it was screwed up.\" In the meantime, the governorâ€™s office took umbrage with the piece and The News. â€œYou know, one wacky idea would be to just ... not run crazy s--- on your opinion page during the worst global pandemic in 100 years,â€ Whitmerâ€™s communications director Zack Pohl wrote me Saturday. â€œWhat qualifications does Kathy Hoekstra have? Is she a lawyer? Is she a physician? Who pays her salary? What exactly is her expertise here? If you don't immediately know the answers to these questions, how can you expect your readers to? And that seems like a problem.â€Â  The problem was neither the credentials of the writer nor the opinion she expressed. Nor was it The Newsâ€™ standards for allowing her to express them. This was not fake news, as critics of the piece alleged. It was public service journalism. LARA's original letter created fear among physicians desperate to treat patients dying of the virus. That confusion was caused byÂ miscommunication between branches of state government. It had the real potential to cost the lives of real MichiganiansÂ in real time.Â  And it has been clarified because of that opinion piece in The News. Weâ€™ll take the heat, gladly, because thatâ€™s exactly the kind of thing weâ€™re here to do. \n","Y3 The COVID-19 pandemic has forged unprecedented cooperation between Metro Detroit health systems on potential treatments for the respiratory illness but also created tension as they coordinate howÂ toÂ spread patients inÂ crowded facilities to less-filled ones across Michigan.Â Â  But health leaders sayÂ their systems are working together to push for more resources to care for thousands of sick patients overwhelming hospitals as potential cases multiply by the minute.Â  \"We are all in it together, and we all need help, and we all need resources â€” three times more resources than we currently have,\" saidÂ Dr. Teena Chopra, chief of infectious diseasesÂ at the Detroit Medical Center, on Monday. \"Wayne County is pretty much exploding at this time.\" In response, Chopra said DMC, Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System are \"making a lot of decisions as a combined health care system in Southeast Michigan.\" \"We have been transferring patients elsewhere, and we are really looking forward to the arrangements being made at the (TCF) Center,\" said Chopra, referring to bed spaces being created at the Detroit convention center for patients with mild symptoms.Â  \"We know that this week and the coming few weeks are going to be very tough on usÂ â€”Â just like New York. We have asked for help, just like every other southeast Michigan hospital.\" Several health systems, meanwhile,Â have been transferring patientsÂ to the University of Michigan health system, known asÂ Michigan Medicine, to participate in a clinical trial of the medicationÂ Remdesivir, a general anti-viral medication. It wasÂ once contemplated asÂ aÂ possible treatmentÂ for SARS and MERS and tested in clinical trials as aÂ treatment forÂ Ebola.Â  Henry Ford Health System also hasÂ multiple studies underway, including one to evaluate the effectivenessÂ of Remdesivir in treating coronavirus patients with moderate or severe symptoms, spokeswoman Kim North Shine said.Â Â Â  Since Henry Ford is already running trials with the drug, its transfers to Michigan Medicine are to help balance the number of patientsÂ the hospitals are treating, rather than for the university's Remdesivir study, she noted. â€œIn additionÂ to the new trials, several Henry Ford patients have received Remdesivir under the compassionate use program that allows sick patients to have access to unproven treatment therapies,â€ North Shine said. â€œThe patients are being monitored; however, it is still too early to tell if the medication has made a difference in their recovery.â€ Recognizing there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy to treat the virus, Henry Ford also is using off-label hydroxychloroquine on some hospitalized COVID-19 patients who meet certain criteria, North Shine added. The Detroit-based hospital system is documenting its use of the product in the patientâ€™s medical record to comply with the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs requirements. But the effort at balancing patient loads across hospital systems â€œis not going smoothly,â€ said Beaumont Health CEO and PresidentÂ John Fox. â€œRight now, itâ€™s a function of luckâ€ if another hospital will open its doors to transfers,Â Fox said, â€œor the medical directors have to ask and beg and cajole, and itâ€™s not effective.â€ He blamed the problem on a combination ofÂ incomplete data being provided by some hospitals to the stateÂ and worry among relief hospitals of quickly being overwhelmed by the transfers. The state Department of Health and Human Services and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's office did not respond to requests for comment on the problems with the load balancing plan. The clinical treatments are part of an effort by Wayne State University and the region's four major health systemsÂ â€” DMC, Henry Ford, Ascension MichiganÂ and Beaumont â€” to develop best practices for treating COVID-19 and potentially conduct clinical trials of possible treatments.Â  \"This viral pandemic has no boundaries,â€ said Dr. Shukri David, chair of Cardiovascular Services at Ascension Michigan, in a press release about the partnership.Â â€œBy combining the resources of our medical community, we will offer research opportunities.\" The university and health systems hopeÂ to receive National Institutes of Health approval to bring two specific COVID-19 trials to southeast Michigan, includingÂ Modernaâ€™s potential COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna's chief executive officer said the companyÂ might provide the vaccine to a few people, which could include health care workers, as early as this fall.Â A healthy volunteer received the first COVID-19 vaccine on March 16. The company estimates it could take 18 months to make it commercially available, if the trials prove successful. The institutionsÂ also hopeÂ to start clinical trials on Takedaâ€™s hyperimmune globulin, a potential treatment.Â Using plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19, the company is evaluating a treatment thatâ€™s effective on other severe acute viral respiratory infections.Â  â€œThe whole idea is we want to collaborate in the region, apply for the new trials and be part of discovering best practices and treatments for COVID-19,â€ said Dr. William W. Oâ€™Neill, an interventional cardiologist with Henry Ford, in a press release. Many area hospitals are treating patients with hydroxychloroquine, an unproven treatment they hope will lessen the severity of COVID-19 in some patients. The FDAÂ in late FebruaryÂ issued an emergency use authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, another name for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Â Several Metro Detroit health systems say they are using it. The decades-old malaria drugs have beenÂ championed by President Donald Trump for COVID-19Â treatmentÂ to the consternation of some medical experts because little evidence is available on their safety or effectiveness.Â  \"We have itÂ on our formulary, and weâ€™re treating our patients with hydroxychloroquine at the DMC,\" said Chopra, noting they're are not using it with the antibiotic azithromycin, a combination that's being tested in clinical trials. \"We donâ€™t know at this point if the combination works, but we do know that hydroxychloroquine works, and we have actually successfully discharged several patients (who received the treatment).\" Dr. Nasir Husain, director of the Infection Prevention ProgramÂ at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital, said doctorsÂ have been using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patientsÂ but are exercising caution.Â  \"We do have some patients on that,\" Husain said. \"The thing to understand is that these drugs have not been shown in proper, vetted clinical trials to have different outcomes. \"Unfortunately, there's nothing out there in terms of good academic literature to show that either alone or in combination with either hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin it works,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean nobody's doing itÂ â€” everybody's doing it, including us. But I'm quite skeptical, and I'm making sure we're not causing any harm to the patients.\"Â  Researchers are racing to learn more about the coronavirus, and the information available is changing every day.   in the journal Physician's Weekly found chloroquine and hydroxychloroquineÂ to be efficient in treating Chinese COVID-19 patients,Â though the sample of patients studied was small.Â  The state last week warned prescribers and dispensers against â€œstockpilingâ€ hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or prescribing them â€œwithout further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19.â€ There had been allegations physicians were prescribing the drug to themselves, friends or family â€œwithout a legitimate medical purposeâ€ and the practice could create a shortage for those who take the drug for other illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, according to the letter from state Bureau of Professional Licensing Director Deb Gagliardi. â€œReports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action,â€ Gagliardi wrote last Tuesday. â€œPrescribing any kind of prescription must also be associated with medical documentation showing proof of the medical necessity and medical condition for which the patient is being treated.Â Again, these are drugs that have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.â€ In follow-up correspondence last week, the department clarified that physicians and pharmacists should â€œadhere to the standards of practice and exercise the professional judgment applicable to their professions.â€ Several medical, physician and pharmacy associations supported the departmentâ€™s Thursday letter, noting that the medicine, when used for COVID-19, should be reserved for the stateâ€™s â€œsickest and most vulnerable patientsâ€ and physicians should avoid â€œexcessive, anticipatory orders.â€ Whitmer on Monday defended the policy and reiterated the need for an approach that balanced the demand between COVID-19 patients and those who were using the drug before COVID-19 to treat other conditions. â€œWe obviously want to be nimble in this crisis, and I think that we have a duty to make sure that weâ€™re making educated policies that reflect the needs of the people of our state,â€ she said. Henry Ford has moved some patients within its hospitals and sent others to the University of Michigan, according to Henry Ford's North Shine. UM confirmed it had accepted transfers from different hospitals but did not say which ones or how many patients.Â  As of Monday, hospitals statewide had a total of 12,741 beds available, including 661 adult intensive care unit beds, according to state data. A total of 1,488 ventilators were available. The totals represent an 85% response rate from hospitals supplying data to the state. In north and south segments of southeast Michiganâ€™s Region 2, there were a total of 4,908 beds available Monday and 230 adult ICU beds. Region 2 had 778 ventilators available. Including beds already occupied, the state has roughly 27,000 beds overall and 1,622 ventilators. Beaumont's Fox said efforts to balance patients among hospitals are laggingÂ because the data hospitals are supposed to be supplying to the state about their bed and patientÂ numbers do not appear to be complete, causing the regional medical directors to â€œfly blindâ€ when determining where there might be openings. And even if hospital bed and patientÂ data were complete, regional medical directors lack authority to demand hospitals take overflow, he said. For example, on Saturday, the emergency department at Beaumontâ€™s Farmington Hills hospital was â€œslammedâ€ with coronavirus cases, Fox said. Even excluding those waiting in the emergency room, the hospitalâ€™s census was comprised of about 90% COVID-19 patients. When the medical director for southeast Michiganâ€™s Region 2, where Beaumontâ€™s hospitals are located, asked other hospitals to accept patients from the Farmington Hills hospital, the director was turned down due to worries over personal protection equipment, known as PPE, or the prospect of taking on coronavirus patients, Fox said. â€œSome hospitals simply said theyâ€™re not taking COVID-19 patients from an ER,â€ Fox said. â€œOthers say they donâ€™t have PPE. Weâ€™ve offered to send patients with PPE. â€¦ I think that everybody is maybe scared and worried about what it might be like next week.â€ Eventually, Michigan Medicine agreed to take the patients, but the distribution should be balanced within the region, Fox said. And hospitals should not have to send a patient to an outstate location three hours away when there are openings within the region, he said. â€œThe hotspot in Michigan right now is Region 2,â€ Fox said. â€œYou have some hospitals on total overload and some on less. â€œThe purpose of the state, from an emergency management standpoint, is to even it out.â€ \n","text1 I quickly requested of (Whitmerâ€™s) staff that they put something out, and somehow in the translation it was prohibiting use of these drugs â€” and that wasn't the intent.

The claim appeared in   (archived  ) published by thefederalist.com on November 23, 2020 under the title \"Many Studies Find that Cloth Masks Do Not Stop Viruses Like COVID\" Under the title, the article poses a question: Though the title of thefederalist.com article suggests the article will focus on \"many\" studies that find cloth masks don't stop the coronavirus, that point is never developed. Instead, the article finds fault with published research often cited as proof that mask wearing reduces the spread of infection from the coronavirus. The article's author is Lisa Mair, who is identified as having a Master of Science degree in food science and nutrition, and as being \"an advocate for natural health for decades.\" Among the studies she questions is one that the CDC offers as support for community mask wearing. The   is based on the case of two Springfield, Missouri, hairstylists with the coronavirus, who appear not to have infected their clients. Clients and hairstylists all wore masks. The study's authors were able to investigate the cases of 67 of the 139 clients the symptomatic hairstylists had contact with during an eight-day period. None of those clients got infected. Mair's reasons for questioning the research, which received much media attention, include the fact that many of the clients declined to participate in the study. For now, let's stick with the measures that do help: social distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding chronic disease. Only don a fresh, clean N95 mask for short periods of time when you're unavoidably close to others indoors.

The post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( )Â  Vaccine skeptics commonly   VAERS reports as evidence that vaccines are lethal or otherwise dangerous. But the agencies that run the tracking system warn that the reports shouldnâ€™t be misinterpreted. Search results on the system come with this caveat: \"VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.\" Without further study, vaccine experts say, itâ€™s not possible to tell whether a particular adverse event is linked to the vaccine or merely occurred afterward as a coincidence, and they cautioned against drawing inferences from reports published in the database.Â  Without that context, posts like this one risk misleading people by implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to these deaths. An adverse event is a health problem that arises after someone has received a vaccine. VAERS accepts and records any and all reports of adverse events, and the government acknowledges that \"reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.\" To illustrate the shortcomings of the database, one physician   that a vaccine had turned him into the Incredible Hulk, the comic-book character. Both the CDC and the physician   to PolitiFact that his report was initially accepted and entered into the system as an adverse event.Â  Since VAERS doesnâ€™t show whether an adverse event was caused by the vaccine or occurred coincidentally, itâ€™s generally not useful on its own for assessing whether a vaccine poses a risk to human health, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta. Instead, vaccine experts said, VAERS should be seen as a \"hypothesis-generating\" system, which helps scientists decide which negative side effects to test for. For example, in 1999, VAERS reports helped physicians   that a rotavirus vaccine was associated with a form of bowel obstruction called intussusception, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. After physicians monitoring the system noticed a cluster of reports detailing intussusception in young vaccinated children, they commissioned additional studies comparing vaccinated patients with non-vaccinated patients. These studies found that the incidence of intussusception in vaccinated patients was significantly higher than in a control group. The vaccine was pulled from the market.Â  In this case, VAERS was used as an early warning system that prompted scientists to commission more comprehensive studies. The reports werenâ€™t themselves used to make a determination about vaccine safety.Â  \"A system like VAERS can never answer the question of whether a vaccine causes a particular outcome,\" said Offit. \"The only way to establish causation is through a study involving a control group.\" The COVID-19 vaccines now being rolled out to the public were subject to these kinds of studies to determine whether they caused serious health issues. Tens of thousands of people participated in clinical trials last year to demonstrate to regulators that the COVID-19 vaccines were safe. To receive FDA emergency-use authorization, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna had to follow up with at least half of participants for at least two months after they received their vaccinations. A Facebook post from an anti-vaccine group shows a list of people who died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to those deaths.Â  The claim relies on reports from a federal tracking system of adverse events occurring after vaccinations. The agencies that maintain that system warn that the reports should not be used to draw conclusions about whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event. To establish causation, experts look beyond isolated data points to studies of large groups of people to see if a negative symptom is more prominent in vaccinated people than in non-vaccinated ones.Â  The COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people.Â  We rate this statement Mostly False. â€‹ Learn the Risk, a Facebook  , Feb. 9, 2021 VAERS,  Vaxopedia,   Aug. 24, 2019 PolitiFact,  , May 11, 2017 New England Journal of Medicine,  , Feb. 22, 2001 Interview with Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Feb. 15, 2021 Email interview with Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, Feb. 16, 2021 \n"," \n"," \n","In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","text1 revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths, everyone was lied to a lot of temporal associations that are not necessarily causal.

Search results on the system come with this caveat: \"VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.\" Without further study, vaccine experts say, itâ€™s not possible to tell whether a particular adverse event is linked to the vaccine or merely occurred afterward as a coincidence, and they cautioned against drawing inferences from reports published in the database.Â  Without that context, posts like this one risk misleading people by implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to these deaths. An adverse event is a health problem that arises after someone has received a vaccine. VAERS accepts and records any and all reports of adverse events, and the government acknowledges that \"reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.\" To illustrate the shortcomings of the database, one physician   that a vaccine had turned him into the Incredible Hulk, the comic-book character. Both the CDC and the physician   to PolitiFact that his report was initially accepted and entered into the system as an adverse event.Â  Since VAERS doesnâ€™t show whether an adverse event was caused by the vaccine or occurred coincidentally, itâ€™s generally not useful on its own for assessing whether a vaccine poses a risk to human health, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta. Instead, vaccine experts said, VAERS should be seen as a \"hypothesis-generating\" system, which helps scientists decide which negative side effects to test for. For example, in 1999, VAERS reports helped physicians   that a rotavirus vaccine was associated with a form of bowel obstruction called intussusception, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. After physicians monitoring the system noticed a cluster of reports detailing intussusception in young vaccinated children, they commissioned additional studies comparing vaccinated patients with non-vaccinated patients. These studies found that the incidence of intussusception in vaccinated patients was significantly higher than in a control group. The vaccine was pulled from the market.Â  In this case, VAERS was used as an early warning system that prompted scientists to commission more comprehensive studies. The reports werenâ€™t themselves used to make a determination about vaccine safety.Â  \"A system like VAERS can never answer the question of whether a vaccine causes a particular outcome,\" said Offit. \"The only way to establish causation is through a study involving a control group.\" The COVID-19 vaccines now being rolled out to the public were subject to these kinds of studies to determine whether they caused serious health issues. Tens of thousands of people participated in clinical trials last year to demonstrate to regulators that the COVID-19 vaccines were safe. To receive FDA emergency-use authorization, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna had to follow up with at least half of participants for at least two months after they received their vaccinations. A Facebook post from an anti-vaccine group shows a list of people who died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to those deaths.Â  The claim relies on reports from a federal tracking system of adverse events occurring after vaccinations. The agencies that maintain that system warn that the reports should not be used to draw conclusions about whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event. To establish causation, experts look beyond isolated data points to studies of large groups of people to see if a negative symptom is more prominent in vaccinated people than in non-vaccinated ones.Â  The COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people.Â  We rate this statement Mostly False. â€‹ Learn the Risk, a Facebook  , Feb. 9, 2021 VAERS,  Vaxopedia,   Aug. 24, 2019 PolitiFact,  , May 11, 2017 New England Journal of Medicine,  , Feb. 22, 2001 Interview with Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Feb. 15, 2021 Email interview with Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, Feb. 16, 2021 \n"," \n"," \n","In a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","Y3 Misinformation isn't going away just because it's a new year.

(AP) â€” President Donald Trump went through a â€œvery concerningâ€ period Friday and faces a â€œcriticalâ€ next two days in his fight against COVID-19 at a military hospital, his chief of staff said Saturday â€” in contrast to a rosier assessment moments earlier by Trump doctors, who took pains not to reveal the president had received supplemental oxygen at the White House before his hospital admission. Trump offered his own assessment Saturday evening in a video from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to â€œbe back soon.â€ Hours earlier, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, â€œWeâ€™re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.â€ In an update on the president Saturday night, his chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was â€œnot yet out of the woods.â€ The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment, with the presidentâ€™s health and the nationâ€™s leadership on the line. With Trump expected to remain hospitalized several more days and the presidential election looming, his condition is being anxiously watched by Americans. Moreover, the presidentâ€™s health represents a national security issue of paramount importance not only to the functions of the U.S. government but to countries around the world, friendly and otherwise. Saturdayâ€™s briefing by Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley and other doctors raised more questions than it answered. Conley repeatedly refused to say whether the president ever needed supplemental oxygen, despite repeated questioning, and declined to share key details including how high a fever Trump had been running before it came back down to a normal range. Conley also revealed that Trump had begun exhibiting â€œclinical indicationsâ€ of COVID-19 on Thursday afternoon, earlier than previously known. Conley spent much of the briefing dodging reportersâ€™ questions, as he was pressed for details.  â€œThursday no oxygen. None at this moment. And yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,â€ Conley said.  But according to a person familiar with Trumpâ€™s condition, Trump was administered oxygen at the White House on Friday morning, well before he was transported to the military hospital by helicopter that evening. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press only on condition of anonymity, Conley said that Trumpâ€™s symptoms, including a mild cough, nasal congestion and fatigue â€œare now resolving and improving,â€ and said the president had been fever-free for 24 hours. But Trump also is taking aspirin, which lowers body temperature and could mask or mitigate that symptom. â€œHeâ€™s in exceptionally good spirits,â€ said another doctor, Sean Dooley, who said Trumpâ€™s heart, kidney, and liver functions were normal and that he was not having trouble breathing or walking around. In an evening health update, Conley said Trump had been up and moving around his medical suite without difficulty and conducting business. â€œWhile not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic,â€ he said. In the hospital video, Trump defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events in the midst of a pandemic. â€œI had no choice,â€ said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. â€œI had to be out front ... I canâ€™t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. ... As a leader, you have to confront problems.â€ Trump also thanked his medical team and hailed the state-of-the-art treatments he was receiving, comparing them to â€œmiracles coming down from God.â€ Trumpâ€™s medical care is far superior to the average Americanâ€™s, with around-the-clock attention and experimental treatments. The president was angry at Meadowsâ€™ public assessment of his health and, in an effort to prove his vitality, Trump ordered up the video and authorized longtime confidant Rudy Giuliani to release a statement on his behalf that he was feeling well, according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.  Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide and killed more than 200,000 people in the U.S. First lady Melania Trump remained at the White House to recover from her own bout with the virus. She was â€œreally handling it very nicely,â€ Trump said in the video, noting with a touch of humor that she was â€œjust a little tiny bit youngerâ€ â€” in fact, 24 years younger. Meadows himself had insisted Friday morning that Trump had only â€œmild symptomsâ€ as the White House tried to project an image of normalcy. It was unclear whether Trump already had received oxygen when Meadows spoke. â€œPresident Trump remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms and has been working throughout the day,â€ press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said late in the day on Friday. She said Trump had only been sent to Walter Reed as a precaution. Trumpâ€™s administration has been less than transparent with the public throughout the pandemic, both about the presidentâ€™s health and the virusâ€™ spread inside the White House. The first word that a close aide to Trump had been infected came from the media, not the White House. And aides have repeatedly declined to share basic health information, including a full accounting of the presidentâ€™s symptoms, what tests heâ€™s undertaken and the results.  In a memo released late Friday, Conley did report that Trump had been treated at the hospital with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after sharing that heâ€™d taking another experimental drug at the White House.  Conley declined to say when Trump had last been tested before he was confirmed to have COVID-19 late Thursday. He initially suggested that Trump was 72 hours into the diagnosis â€” which would mean that he was confirmed infected Wednesday. Conley later clarified that Trump was administered an accurate test for the virus on Thursday afternoon, after White House aide Hope Hicks was confirmed to be positive and Trump exhibited â€œclinical indicationsâ€ of the virus. The White House has said Trump was expected to stay at the hospital for â€œa few daysâ€ and would continue to work from its presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties. In addition to accessibility to tests and equipment, the decision to move to the hospital on Friday was made, at least in part, with the understanding that hurrying there later could send a worrying signal if he took a turn for the worse. On Saturday, Conley said Trumpâ€™s blood oxygen level was 96%, which is in the normal range. The two experimental drugs he has received, given through an IV, have shown some promise against COVID-19. On Friday, he was given a single dose of a drug Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. is testing to supply antibodies to help his immune system fight the virus. Friday night, he began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways â€” the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus and remdesivir curbs the virusâ€™ ability to multiply.  â€œWeâ€™re maximizing all aspects of his care,â€ attacking the virus in multiple ways, Conley said. â€œI didnâ€™t want to hold anything back if there was any possibility it would add value to his care.â€ He noted that in many cases, COVID-19 can become more dangerous as the body responds. â€œThe first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10, are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness,â€ he said. At the same time, the White House has been working to trace a flurry of new infections of close Trump aides and allies. Attention is focused in particular on the Sept. 26 White House event introducing Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee. That day, Trump gathered more than 150 people in the Rose Garden, where they mingled, hugged and shook hands â€” overwhelmingly without masks. There were also several indoor receptions, where Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, her family, senators and others spent time in the close quarters of the White House, photographs show. Among those who attended and have now tested positive: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers â€” Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. The presidentâ€™s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, have also tested positive, though they were not at the event. Another prominent Republican who has tested positive: Sen. Ron Johnson. R-Wis., One of the presidentâ€™s personal assistants, Nick Luna, tested positive after having traveled with Trump several times recently, a White House official said Saturday night. The official wasnâ€™t authorized to discuss the matter by name and requested anonymity. Despite its failure to protect the president and senior staff from infection, the White House has given no indication that it intends to make any major protocol changes, such as mandating that everyone wears a mask. Meadows, the chief of staff, accompanied the president to the hospital aboard Marine One, the kind of small, enclosed space where experts say the virus easily spreads. Those aboard did wear masks. While Vice President Mike Pence is currently off the campaign trail preparing for the coming weekâ€™s vice presidential debate, he and his staff are operating under a â€œbusiness as usualâ€ approach. Heâ€™s still planning to travel to Arizona on Thursday, Indiana on Friday and Florida on Saturday for events instead of isolating himself after potential exposure and to protect himself from contracting the virus anywhere else. ___ Colvin and Miller reported from Washington.

The first word that a close aide to Trump had been infected came from the media, not the White House. And aides have repeatedly declined to share basic health information, including a full accounting of the presidentâ€™s symptoms, what tests heâ€™s undertaken and the results.  In a memo released late Friday, Conley did report that Trump had been treated at the hospital with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after sharing that heâ€™d taking another experimental drug at the White House.  Conley declined to say when Trump had last been tested before he was confirmed to have COVID-19 late Thursday. He initially suggested that Trump was 72 hours into the diagnosis â€” which would mean that he was confirmed infected Wednesday. Conley later clarified that Trump was administered an accurate test for the virus on Thursday afternoon, after White House aide Hope Hicks was confirmed to be positive and Trump exhibited â€œclinical indicationsâ€ of the virus. The White House has said Trump was expected to stay at the hospital for â€œa few daysâ€ and would continue to work from its presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties. In addition to accessibility to tests and equipment, the decision to move to the hospital on Friday was made, at least in part, with the understanding that hurrying there later could send a worrying signal if he took a turn for the worse. On Saturday, Conley said Trumpâ€™s blood oxygen level was 96%, which is in the normal range. The two experimental drugs he has received, given through an IV, have shown some promise against COVID-19. On Friday, he was given a single dose of a drug Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. is testing to supply antibodies to help his immune system fight the virus. Friday night, he began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways â€” the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus and remdesivir curbs the virusâ€™ ability to multiply.  â€œWeâ€™re maximizing all aspects of his care,â€ attacking the virus in multiple ways, Conley said. â€œI didnâ€™t want to hold anything back if there was any possibility it would add value to his care.â€ He noted that in many cases, COVID-19 can become more dangerous as the body responds. â€œThe first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10, are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness,â€ he said. At the same time, the White House has been working to trace a flurry of new infections of close Trump aides and allies. Attention is focused in particular on the Sept. 26 White House event introducing Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee. That day, Trump gathered more than 150 people in the Rose Garden, where they mingled, hugged and shook hands â€” overwhelmingly without masks. There were also several indoor receptions, where Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, her family, senators and others spent time in the close quarters of the White House, photographs show. Among those who attended and have now tested positive: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers â€” Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. The presidentâ€™s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, have also tested positive, though they were not at the event. Another prominent Republican who has tested positive: Sen. Ron Johnson. R-Wis., One of the presidentâ€™s personal assistants, Nick Luna, tested positive after having traveled with Trump several times recently, a White House official said Saturday night. The official wasnâ€™t authorized to discuss the matter by name and requested anonymity. Despite its failure to protect the president and senior staff from infection, the White House has given no indication that it intends to make any major protocol changes, such as mandating that everyone wears a mask. Meadows, the chief of staff, accompanied the president to the hospital aboard Marine One, the kind of small, enclosed space where experts say the virus easily spreads. Those aboard did wear masks. While Vice President Mike Pence is currently off the campaign trail preparing for the coming weekâ€™s vice presidential debate, he and his staff are operating under a â€œbusiness as usualâ€ approach. Heâ€™s still planning to travel to Arizona on Thursday, Indiana on Friday and Florida on Saturday for events instead of isolating himself after potential exposure and to protect himself from contracting the virus anywhere else. ___ Colvin and Miller reported from Washington. Associated Press chief medical writer Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee contributed to this report. \n","Y2 WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Stricken by COVID-19, a feverish and fatigued President Donald Trump was flown to a military hospital Friday night where he is being given Remdesivir therapy after being injected with an experimental drug combination in treatment at the White House. In a day of whipsaw events, the president, who has spent months downplaying the threat of the virus, was forced to cancel all campaign events a month before the election as he fought a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans and is hitting others in his orbit as well. The White House said Trumpâ€™s expected stay of â€œa few daysâ€ at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center     and that he would continue to work from the hospitalâ€™s presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties. Trump walked out of the White House Friday evening wearing a mask and gave a thumbs-up to reporters but did not speak before boarding Marine One. Members of the aircrew, Secret Service agents and White House staff wore face coverings to protect themselves from the president onboard the helicopter. In a video taped before leaving for Walter Reed, Trump said, â€œI think Iâ€™m doing very well, but weâ€™re going to make sure that things work out.â€    . â€œGoing welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!â€ he wrote in his first tweet from the hospital Friday night. Just a month before the presidential election, Trumpâ€™s revelation that he was positive for the virus came by tweet about 1 a.m. Friday after he had returned from a Thursday afternoon political fundraiser. He had gone ahead to the event, saying nothing to the crowd though knowing he had been exposed to an aide with the disease that has infected millions in America and killed more than a million worldwide. First lady Melania Trump also tested positive, the president said, and several others in the White House have, too, prompting concern that the White House or even Trump himself might have spread the virus further. He said in his video that his wife was doing very well. Several administration officials pointed to the Saturday Rose Garden announcement of Trumpâ€™s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court as the possible connection between cases that spanned Washington Friday. Former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers who were also present at the event â€” Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis â€” announced Friday they had tested positive and were isolating. Also testing positive: Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Bill Stepien. Campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh confirmed news, first reported by Politico, that Stepien received a diagnosis Friday and is experiencing â€œmild flu-like symptoms.â€ Stepien, who joined Trump at Tuesdayâ€™s first presidential debate, plans to quarantine until he recovers. Trumpâ€™s diagnosis came during     in Washington and around the world, with the     amid the human and economic toll of the virus. Trumpâ€™s immediate campaign events were all canceled, and his next debate with Democrat Joe Biden, scheduled for Oct. 15, is now in question. Trump has been trying all year â€” and as recently as Wednesday â€” to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is past, and he has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable. He has mostly refused to abide by basic public health guidelines â€” including those issued by his own administration â€” such as wearing face coverings in public and practicing social distancing. Until he tested positive, he continued to hold campaign rallies that drew thousands of often maskless supporters. â€œI felt no vulnerability whatsoever,â€ he told reporters back in May. With the election coming up in about a month, he is urging states and cities to â€œreopenâ€ and reduce or eliminate shutdown rules despite continuing virus outbreaks. The White House tried to maintain an atmosphere of business-as-usual on Friday. â€œPresident Trump remains in good spirts, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,â€ said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. â€œOut of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.â€ The presidentâ€™s physician said in a memo that Trump received a dose of an experimental antibody combination by Regeneron that is in clinical trials. Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley said Trump â€œremains fatigued but in good spiritsâ€ and that a team of experts was evaluating both the president and first lady in regard to next steps. Late Friday, Conley issued an update that said Trump is â€œdoing very wellâ€ and is â€œnot requiring any supplemental oxygen,â€ But he said that, â€œin consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate Remdesivir therapy,â€ an antiviral medication. â€œHe has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably,â€ the doctor wrote. The first lady, who is 50, has a â€œmild cough and headache,â€ Conley reported, and the remainder of the first family, including the Trumpsâ€™ son Barron, who lives at the White House, tested negative. Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide. Both Democratic presidential nominee Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris have tested negative, their campaign said. Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus Friday morning and â€œremains in good health,â€ his spokesman said. Pence was to resume his campaign schedule after his test. Barrett, who was with Trump and many others on Saturday and has been on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers, also tested negative, the White House said. It was confirmed that she had a mild case of COVID earlier this year and has now recovered. Very early Friday, after returning from the Thursday afternoon New Jersey fundraiser, Trump stunningly tweeted, â€œTonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!â€  Hours earlier, the White House confirmed that a top aide who had traveled with him during the week had tested positive. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Friday confirmed that the White House knew Hope Hicks, the aide, had tested positive before Trump attended the fundraiser. â€œI can tell you in terms of Hope Hicks, we discovered that right as Marine One was taking off yesterday,â€ said Meadows. Several staffers were pulled from the trip, but Trump did not cancel and there was no direct evidence that her illness was connected to his. Many White House and senior administration officials were undergoing tests Friday, but the full scale of the outbreak around the president may not be known for some time     by a test. Officials with the White House Medical Unit were tracing the presidentâ€™s contacts. Trumpâ€™s handling of the pandemic has already been a major flashpoint in his race against Biden, who spent much of the summer off the campaign trail and at his home in Delaware citing concern about the virus. Biden has since resumed a more active campaign schedule, but with small, socially distanced crowds. He also regularly wears a mask in public, something Trump mocked him for at    . â€œI donâ€™t wear masks like him,â€ Trump said. â€œEvery time you see him, heâ€™s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask Iâ€™ve ever seen.â€ In a tweet Friday morning, Biden said he and his wife â€œsend our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.â€  World leaders offered the president and first family     after their diagnosis, and governments used the case as a reminder for their citizens to wear masks and practice social distancing measures. Multiple White House staffers have previously tested positive for the virus, including Penceâ€™s press secretary, Katie Miller, national security adviser Robert Oâ€™Brien and one of the presidentâ€™s personal valets. An RNC official confirmed Friday that Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel learned she had tested positive Wednesday afternoon. She has been at her home in Michigan since last Saturday and did not attend the debate. It is unclear where the Trumps or Hicks caught the virus, but in a Fox interview, Trump seemed to suggest it may have been spread by someone in the military or law enforcement in greetings. The White House began instituting a daily testing regimen for the presidentâ€™s senior aides after earlier positive cases close to the president. Anyone in close proximity to the president or vice president is also tested every day, including reporters. Trump is far from the first world leader to test positive for the virus, which previously infected Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was hospitalized last month while fighting what he called a â€œhellishâ€ case of COVID-19. \n","text1 He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly.

Trumpâ€™s immediate campaign events were all canceled, and his next debate with Democrat Joe Biden, scheduled for Oct. 15, is now in question. Trump has been trying all year â€” and as recently as Wednesday â€” to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is past, and he has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable. He has mostly refused to abide by basic public health guidelines â€” including those issued by his own administration â€” such as wearing face coverings in public and practicing social distancing. Until he tested positive, he continued to hold campaign rallies that drew thousands of often maskless supporters. â€œI felt no vulnerability whatsoever,â€ he told reporters back in May. With the election coming up in about a month, he is urging states and cities to â€œreopenâ€ and reduce or eliminate shutdown rules despite continuing virus outbreaks. The White House tried to maintain an atmosphere of business-as-usual on Friday. â€œPresident Trump remains in good spirts, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,â€ said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. â€œOut of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.â€ The presidentâ€™s physician said in a memo that Trump received a dose of an experimental antibody combination by Regeneron that is in clinical trials. Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley said Trump â€œremains fatigued but in good spiritsâ€ and that a team of experts was evaluating both the president and first lady in regard to next steps. Late Friday, Conley issued an update that said Trump is â€œdoing very wellâ€ and is â€œnot requiring any supplemental oxygen,â€ But he said that, â€œin consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate Remdesivir therapy,â€ an antiviral medication. â€œHe has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably,â€ the doctor wrote. The first lady, who is 50, has a â€œmild cough and headache,â€ Conley reported, and the remainder of the first family, including the Trumpsâ€™ son Barron, who lives at the White House, tested negative. Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide. Both Democratic presidential nominee Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris have tested negative, their campaign said. Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus Friday morning and â€œremains in good health,â€ his spokesman said. Pence was to resume his campaign schedule after his test. Barrett, who was with Trump and many others on Saturday and has been on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers, also tested negative, the White House said. It was confirmed that she had a mild case of COVID earlier this year and has now recovered. Very early Friday, after returning from the Thursday afternoon New Jersey fundraiser, Trump stunningly tweeted, â€œTonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!â€  Hours earlier, the White House confirmed that a top aide who had traveled with him during the week had tested positive. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Friday confirmed that the White House knew Hope Hicks, the aide, had tested positive before Trump attended the fundraiser. â€œI can tell you in terms of Hope Hicks, we discovered that right as Marine One was taking off yesterday,â€ said Meadows. Several staffers were pulled from the trip, but Trump did not cancel and there was no direct evidence that her illness was connected to his. Many White House and senior administration officials were undergoing tests Friday, but the full scale of the outbreak around the president may not be known for some time     by a test. Officials with the White House Medical Unit were tracing the presidentâ€™s contacts. Trumpâ€™s handling of the pandemic has already been a major flashpoint in his race against Biden, who spent much of the summer off the campaign trail and at his home in Delaware citing concern about the virus. Biden has since resumed a more active campaign schedule, but with small, socially distanced crowds. He also regularly wears a mask in public, something Trump mocked him for at    . â€œI donâ€™t wear masks like him,â€ Trump said. â€œEvery time you see him, heâ€™s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask Iâ€™ve ever seen.â€ In a tweet Friday morning, Biden said he and his wife â€œsend our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.â€  World leaders offered the president and first family     after their diagnosis, and governments used the case as a reminder for their citizens to wear masks and practice social distancing measures. Multiple White House staffers have previously tested positive for the virus, including Penceâ€™s press secretary, Katie Miller, national security adviser Robert Oâ€™Brien and one of the presidentâ€™s personal valets. An RNC official confirmed Friday that Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel learned she had tested positive Wednesday afternoon. She has been at her home in Michigan since last Saturday and did not attend the debate. It is unclear where the Trumps or Hicks caught the virus, but in a Fox interview, Trump seemed to suggest it may have been spread by someone in the military or law enforcement in greetings. The White House began instituting a daily testing regimen for the presidentâ€™s senior aides after earlier positive cases close to the president. Anyone in close proximity to the president or vice president is also tested every day, including reporters. Trump is far from the first world leader to test positive for the virus, which previously infected Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was hospitalized last month while fighting what he called a â€œhellishâ€ case of COVID-19. \n","i 323\n","Y2 This website is a resource to help advance the understanding of the virus, inform the public, and brief policymakers in order to guide a response, improve care, and save lives.

On the surface, the American COVID-19 testing regime has finally hit its stride. Over the past five days, the states have reported a daily average of 104,000 people tested, according to data assembled by the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer collaboration incubated at   Today, the U.S. reported that 1 million people have been tested for the coronavirusâ€”a milestone that the White House once   it would hit the first week of March. But things are not going as smoothly as the top-line numbers might suggest. Our reporting has unearthed a new coronavirus-testing crisis. Its main cause is not the federal government, nor state public-health labs, but the private companies that now dominate the countryâ€™s testing capacity. Testing backlogs have ballooned, slowing efficient patient care and delivering a heavily lagged view of the outbreak to decision makers. Though the problem is national in scope, California is its known epicenter. Over the past week, the most populous state in the unionâ€”where the countryâ€™s   of community transmission was identified, in late Februaryâ€”has managed to complete an average of only 2,136 tests each day, far fewer than other similarly populous states, according to our tracking data. Yet California also reports that   have   test results. Tens of thousands of Californians have been swabbed for the virus, but their samples have not yet been examined in a lab. That is actually an improvement over the state of affairs this weekend, when California reported that more than 64,000 people had pending results. That number turned out to be incorrect, the result of an â€œinadvertent over-reporting errorâ€ at a private lab,  . But even with that downward adjustmentâ€”and even assuming that labs keep finding ways to test more samples per dayâ€”the numbers suggest that California will take weeks to work through the backlog. In the meantime, California has completed fewer tests per capita than the countryâ€™s next five-largest statesâ€”and fewer tests per capita than any of the 34 states that regularly report their full testing data. New York has tested 13 times more people, on a per capita basis. The overreporting error, the lackluster testing rate, and that persistently huge number of pending tests suggest something is rotten in the Golden Stateâ€™s testing regime. Even more troubling, they raise the possibility that all across the country, huge numbers of results are stuck in purgatory. Within the clinical-testing world, it is an open secret that Quest Diagnosticsâ€”one of the industryâ€™s two big players, along with Labcorpâ€”has struggled to scale up its operations in California. And yet, Quest has continued to accept specimens from across the country, leading to a huge backlog of tests at the companyâ€™s facility in San Juan Capistrano. This failure accounts for at least some of the tens of thousands of pending tests reflected in the stateâ€™s reported numbers. According to experts, it isnâ€™t Questâ€™s fault that the company has so far been unable to meet the technical challenge of testing thousands of people every day. Setting up such â€œhigh throughputâ€ operations is difficult. But Quest failed to come to terms with its ongoing problems, and it continued to accept specimensâ€”and generate revenueâ€”when other laboratories could have done some of the tests faster. Dina Greene encountered the problem firsthand. She is the regional laboratory director for Kaiser Permanente in Washington State. At first, she had Kaiser facilities send their suspected COVID-19 specimens to the University of Washingtonâ€™s virology lab, an academic clinic that has become a major tester for the Seattle area. But then Quest came knocking, promising that it could deliver results within 24 to 48 hours. She did a trial run with the company, but â€œwe quickly realized that it was a no-go and we needed to stick with UW,â€ she told us. â€œQuest has overpromised to prestigious institutions and medical centers around the country, and people are used to relying on Quest for quick and cheap results, but those time and time again have proven not to have the best quality. And in this situation, it has been disastrous to patient care.â€ (Greene is also an associate professor at the UW School of Medicine.) Testing isnâ€™t important only because it helps track the pandemic. For hospitals, coronavirus tests are a crucial tool in managing scarce resources. If a patient comes in with COVID-19-like symptoms, doctors and nurses must act as if the patient has the virus. They must don personal protective equipment, or PPE, every time they interact with the patient until he or she tests negative for the coronavirus. Because the majority of tests still come back negative in most places, hospitals wind up burning through their supply of PPE while taking care of patients who do not actually have the coronavirus. There is  , and some places in California,  , have already used up their emergency supply. â€œLab turnaround time   PPE,â€ says Geoff Baird, the acting laboratory-medicine chair at the University of Washington. â€œMore than a day is a tragedy. Three to five is okay for outpatients if they can sit at home, but it doesnâ€™t address the problem in a hospital.â€ One physician at a community hospital in California, who requested anonymity to protect her job, echoed the sentiment that waiting on negative results hurts her ability to provide care. â€œTime to negative result for a mildly ill patient is maybe the most worrisome thing right now,â€ she told us, because it is creating â€œthe bottleneck which will result in denial of care to patients we can save.â€ At the same time, patients who do have COVID-19 also suffer from testing delays, because they cannot access all possible treatments, Greene said. â€œIf youâ€™re intubated, in critical care, and even your spouse has tested positive, if you donâ€™t have a positive result, they canâ€™t give you the experimental drugs,â€ she said. A Quest spokesperson, Wendy Bost, told us that the companyâ€™s initial effort in California had been overwhelmed by demand. â€œThere was a tremendous demand because we only had the one laboratory [in San Juan Capistrano] for about a week or more, and all the demand was being funneled into that laboratory,â€ she said. She claimed that the situation has improved for current testing. â€œThe average turnaround time nationally is four to five days, from the time where we collect the specimen to when we report the results out,â€ Bost said. â€œHowever, there have been cases that have been several days longer than that.â€ Quest did not disclose how many pending tests it has at the San Juan Capistrano facility or in California or in the nation. Quest faces two major problems in dealing with its backlog, whatever its size. First, on March 9, Quest started using a labor-intensive, laboratory-developed test, Bost said. Then, sometime after March 13, it switched to using a highly automated, high-throughput test created by the Swiss manufacturer Roche.  The problem is that specimens collected for the first type of test cannot be used in the new machineryâ€”and many of the early samples were meant for the laboratory-developed test. It does not matter how many high-speed Roche machines Quest is using now: They cannot be brought to bear on those other samples. This could be one reason for the existing backlog, though Bost told us she could not say so for sure. The second problem is that the federal government has asked that certain testsâ€”such as those for hospitalized people and frontline health workersâ€”be prioritized. But those early samples probably do not have the metadata attached to them that would allow Quest to move them higher up in the queue. So samples meant for the slower test must simply be run on a first in, first out basis. Both of these problems were, to some degree, foreseeable. Quest must have known that it was building an enormous backlog, yet it did not turn down the revenue that came with accepting more testing specimens. Bost said that her company was trying to â€œsupport the public-health responseâ€ in continuing to take specimens. By contrast, when the Utah-based nonprofit ARUP Laboratories realized that it could not fulfill any more COVID-19 tests, it  . In mid-March, the University of Washington  , and stopped taking specimens for a time. The Mayo Clinic laboratory in Minnesota, which often tests samples from across the country, has   to avoid running a backlog. â€œIt may be that Quest has mountains and mountains of specimens that they canâ€™t get to,â€ said a clinical-laboratory director who requested anonymity for fear of damaging their relationship with Quest. â€œIf so, they should tell someone.â€ And though we know about the backlog in California, the problem mayâ€”and probably doesâ€”extend beyond the state, and for that matter beyond Quest too, based on our conversations with laboratory-testing experts, public statements by governors, and the accounts of patients and physicians. Unlike the countryâ€™s first testing crisis, which was defined by a   and  , fault for the new testing problem resides largely in the private sector. But the Trump administration did play a role in the present crisis. Early this month, the White House Coronavirus Task Force realized that most of the countryâ€™s testing capacity existed in commercial laboratories. In particular, those labs specialized in the logistics of testing, the raw expertise needed to specimens in and results out. So the administration leaned into what Vice President Mike Pence   â€œnot just a whole-of-government approach, but a whole-of-America approach.â€ On Wednesday, March 4, the vice president stood next to lab-testing executives in the White House and made  . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had abruptly stopped reporting the number of Americans tested for the coronavirus, but Pence promised that materials for â€œ1.5 million tests are arriving at hospitals around the country.â€ Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, went even further, thanking his colleagues for â€œunbelievably fast work that is leading to 1 million tests being available by the end of the week.â€ Two days later, speaking alongside President Trump  , Azar claimed there would be â€œup to 4 million tests available in the United States by the end of next week.â€ Then the president said: â€œAnybody that wants a test can get a test. Thatâ€™s what the bottom line is.â€ That was not true then, and it is not true now. The net effect of these announcements was to raise hopes   for tests. Americans got the impression that hundreds of thousands of tests were available or would be soon. They were not. And this put all of the nationâ€™s laboratories in an impossible position. On the day of Trumpâ€™s CDC briefing, the country had conducted perhaps 2,000 tests total,  . Twenty-six days have elapsed since Azar first promised that â€œ1 million testsâ€ would soon come online, and 17 days have passed since his deadline for â€œup to 4 million testsâ€ becoming available. Yet just today the U.S. passed 1 million cumulative people tested for the coronavirus. It is a major accomplishment and a testament to the thousands of labs and their workers across the country. But it is far short of the timeline that officials promised. And while testing has ramped up in absolute volumeâ€”the country is now doing roughly 100,000 tests a dayâ€”the United States still lags behind other hard-hit countries in per capita testing. In   and  , roughly 800 of every 100,000 people have been tested for the virus. But in the United States, only about 320 of every 100,000 have been tested. Testing is also wildly uneven among states. While New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have experienced large outbreaks, theyâ€™ve also tested extensively. But in large states like Georgia and Texas (and of course California), the number of tests that have been completed remains troublingly small. The public-private partnership  work. In New York, the company BioReference Laboratories made the decision to bring up all available COVID-19 test assays, regardless of manufacturer, in the last week of February. â€œIt was pretty clear at that time that the chance of this breaking open was pretty much certain,â€ Jon Cohen, the executive chairman of BioReference, told us. â€œIt was just a matter of when and how big it was gonna be.â€ The company brought online five different platforms for testing, including Rocheâ€™s. As BioReference scaled up, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo brokered a deal for it to provide testing capacity to the state. â€œTo his credit, [he] actually reached out,â€ Cohen said. (The two men had a preexisting relationship.) Working with Northwell Health, the largest New York health-care provider, BioReference committed much of its processing capacity to the state. â€œThe result of that is that we ended up being the lab that is doing all the drive-throughs of all of New York State,â€ Cohen said, â€œincluding New Rochelle,â€ the site of one of the most intense early outbreaks. He said his companyâ€™s turnaround times are 24 to 48 hours for outpatient testing and â€œwithin 24 hoursâ€ for hospitals. Through BioReference and other commercial companies, as well as its own laboratories, New York now has almost 20 percent of all the completed tests in the United States. As a consequence, the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed, but at least New York   the severity of its outbreak. If New York is on one end of the spectrum, California is on the other. Whatâ€™s unclear is how common Californiaâ€™s and Questâ€™s situations are. No other state reports that it has such a huge backlog of tests stuck in private laboratories, but Californiaâ€™s reporting idiosyncrasy likely reflects reality better than other statesâ€™ reporting. For example, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker tweeted yesterday that private-lab results in his state are taking â€œ4-7 days and sometimes even up to 10 days.â€ In the best-case scenario, new capacity rises to meet stabilizing demand for tests. Questâ€™s Bost said that â€œin recent days, our capacity, which now exceeds 30,000 tests a day, has been at or above the level of demand.â€ So perhaps the backlogs are no longer growing. One month ago today, the CDC still   that only 15 Americans were sick with the coronavirus. Community transmission of the virus seemed like a fluke, limited to the West Coast or perhaps just Northern California. Itâ€™s now clear that this was an illusion: The virus was already everywhere. Even   suggest that roughly 10,000 Americans may have been infected by March 1. Looking back with barely any hindsight at all, February already seems like a lost month, a different era in American history. In the past several weeks, much of the  country has moved swiftly to confront the coronavirus, which has today infected at least 184,000 Americans and killed more than 3,746. A month from now, the backlog in California may seem just as naive as the CDCâ€™s minuscule count from February seems to us today. California is the flare alerting the nation to systemic problems in our testing regime. Will we heed it? \n","text1 word-of-mouth story The consensus was not that +cases donâ€™t exist, but that the numbers are exaggerated, 10 unused swabs close personal friends that work at a major hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had abruptly stopped reporting the number of Americans tested for the coronavirus, but Pence promised that materials for â€œ1.5 million tests are arriving at hospitals around the country.â€ Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, went even further, thanking his colleagues for â€œunbelievably fast work that is leading to 1 million tests being available by the end of the week.â€ Two days later, speaking alongside President Trump  , Azar claimed there would be â€œup to 4 million tests available in the United States by the end of next week.â€ Then the president said: â€œAnybody that wants a test can get a test. Thatâ€™s what the bottom line is.â€ That was not true then, and it is not true now. The net effect of these announcements was to raise hopes   for tests. Americans got the impression that hundreds of thousands of tests were available or would be soon. They were not. And this put all of the nationâ€™s laboratories in an impossible position. On the day of Trumpâ€™s CDC briefing, the country had conducted perhaps 2,000 tests total,  . Twenty-six days have elapsed since Azar first promised that â€œ1 million testsâ€ would soon come online, and 17 days have passed since his deadline for â€œup to 4 million testsâ€ becoming available. Yet just today the U.S. passed 1 million cumulative people tested for the coronavirus. It is a major accomplishment and a testament to the thousands of labs and their workers across the country. But it is far short of the timeline that officials promised. And while testing has ramped up in absolute volumeâ€”the country is now doing roughly 100,000 tests a dayâ€”the United States still lags behind other hard-hit countries in per capita testing. In   and  , roughly 800 of every 100,000 people have been tested for the virus. But in the United States, only about 320 of every 100,000 have been tested. Testing is also wildly uneven among states. While New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have experienced large outbreaks, theyâ€™ve also tested extensively. But in large states like Georgia and Texas (and of course California), the number of tests that have been completed remains troublingly small. The public-private partnership  work. In New York, the company BioReference Laboratories made the decision to bring up all available COVID-19 test assays, regardless of manufacturer, in the last week of February. â€œIt was pretty clear at that time that the chance of this breaking open was pretty much certain,â€ Jon Cohen, the executive chairman of BioReference, told us. â€œIt was just a matter of when and how big it was gonna be.â€ The company brought online five different platforms for testing, including Rocheâ€™s. As BioReference scaled up, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo brokered a deal for it to provide testing capacity to the state. â€œTo his credit, [he] actually reached out,â€ Cohen said. (The two men had a preexisting relationship.) Working with Northwell Health, the largest New York health-care provider, BioReference committed much of its processing capacity to the state. â€œThe result of that is that we ended up being the lab that is doing all the drive-throughs of all of New York State,â€ Cohen said, â€œincluding New Rochelle,â€ the site of one of the most intense early outbreaks. He said his companyâ€™s turnaround times are 24 to 48 hours for outpatient testing and â€œwithin 24 hoursâ€ for hospitals. Through BioReference and other commercial companies, as well as its own laboratories, New York now has almost 20 percent of all the completed tests in the United States. As a consequence, the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed, but at least New York   the severity of its outbreak. If New York is on one end of the spectrum, California is on the other. Whatâ€™s unclear is how common Californiaâ€™s and Questâ€™s situations are. No other state reports that it has such a huge backlog of tests stuck in private laboratories, but Californiaâ€™s reporting idiosyncrasy likely reflects reality better than other statesâ€™ reporting. For example, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker tweeted yesterday that private-lab results in his state are taking â€œ4-7 days and sometimes even up to 10 days.â€ In the best-case scenario, new capacity rises to meet stabilizing demand for tests. Questâ€™s Bost said that â€œin recent days, our capacity, which now exceeds 30,000 tests a day, has been at or above the level of demand.â€ So perhaps the backlogs are no longer growing. One month ago today, the CDC still   that only 15 Americans were sick with the coronavirus. Community transmission of the virus seemed like a fluke, limited to the West Coast or perhaps just Northern California. Itâ€™s now clear that this was an illusion: The virus was already everywhere. Even   suggest that roughly 10,000 Americans may have been infected by March 1. Looking back with barely any hindsight at all, February already seems like a lost month, a different era in American history. In the past several weeks, much of the  country has moved swiftly to confront the coronavirus, which has today infected at least 184,000 Americans and killed more than 3,746. A month from now, the backlog in California may seem just as naive as the CDCâ€™s minuscule count from February seems to us today. California is the flare alerting the nation to systemic problems in our testing regime. Will we heed it? \n","Y2 We know very little about how reliable tests are for people who donâ€™t feel sick. You go out to a bar with friends this week, and youâ€™re planning to visit your elderly relatives in a few days. You feel healthy, and you even get a COVID-19 test out of caution. The result comes back negative. Is it safe to go? Not exactly, experts say. How well COVID-19 tests work in people who feel healthy is still a key unknown of the pandemic. The test may overlook the small but growing amounts of virus in someone who has not yet developed symptoms, who could still go on to spread COVID-19 without knowing it. So as Americans weigh the risks of attending protests, rallies, birthday parties, dinners, and all of the social gatherings that make up normal life, they will have to contend with the uncertainty that a negative test result does not rule out infection. â€œIf they go do a risky contact, they canâ€™t get a â€˜Get out of jail freeâ€™ card. They canâ€™t just get tested and feel fine,â€  , a disease ecologist at UC Santa Cruz, says. Understanding false negatives from COVID-19 tests is especially important because people who do not yet know that theyâ€™re sick play a major role in the spread of COVID-19. A   based on data in and around China suggests that 44 percent of transmission comes from presymptomatic cases. The United States has not isolated people who say they feel sick as aggressively as China has, so it likely has a higher proportion of symptomatic transmission,  , an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who co-authored the study, says. But Chinaâ€™s experience makes clear that simply isolating people once they are sick is not enough. â€œWe canâ€™t ignore presymptomatic transmission,â€ Cowling says. â€œEven if you manage to stop some of the transmission from going on by doing isolation cases, you still will have this presymptomatic transmission, which keeps the epidemic going.â€ Itâ€™s still unclear how good COVID-19 tests are at finding these presymptomatic cases, but the timing of the test matters. As soon as the coronavirus finds its way into a new host, it hijacks cells to copy itself. The amount of virus builds over this time,  , which can take two to 14 days but usually takes an average of five or six. Accordingly, public-health authorities have   after exposure. This is a reasonable recommendation, given the knowns, but surprisingly little data exists on how early COVID-19 tests can detect infection before symptom onset. One   using COVID-19 cases from seven previously published studies suggests that the false-negative rate is 100 percent on day one of exposure, which falls to 38 percent on day five (when symptoms on average appear) and then a minimum of 20 percent on day eight. But in combing the literature, the researchers behind this model found only one case where a patient was tested before feeling sickâ€”as part of  . Moreover, the model doesnâ€™t address a whole other set of people who never develop symptoms at all. â€œIt gave no information about people who are permanently asymptomatic,â€  , an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who co-authored that study, told me.

Testing large numbers of asymptomatic peopleâ€” â€”to identify potential silent carriers will also be an essential part of the reopening strategy for schools and businesses.

It asks that asymptomatic tests include this statement: â€œNegative results must be considered in the context of an individualâ€™s recent exposures, history, presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19.â€ And this, in the face of imperfect COVID-19 tests, is key to interpreting a negative result.   of having COVID-19 in the first place.

He also announced that the Foundation was awarding two grants totaling $30 million to benefit children and students in India. \"A world without polio is in sight and India deserves much of the credit,\" said Mr. Gates. \"The coming months are critical. I urge parents in India and elsewhere to make sure that their children are immunized.\" Under the leadership of the World Health Organization (WHO), the international community has been working to rid the world of polio by the end of the year 2000. Some 115 countries have been polio-free for over a year. In South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, however, pockets of polio remain and many countries are mounting National Immunization Days (NIDs) to broaden their vaccination coverage.  Once home to almost half of the remaining polio cases, India has made spectacular progress. Between October 1999 and March 2000, over one billion doses of oral polio vaccine were distributed during four national and two regional immunization campaigns. More than 130 million children under the age of 5 have been vaccinated. Because polio remains endemic in parts of Northern India, the national and sub-national campaigns will continue into 2001. Regional campaigns or \"sub-NIDs\" will take place in the states of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal beginning September 24th. In addition, a \"mop-up\" campaign targeting more than 4 million children will take place in Maharashtra starting September 18th. The next round of national immunizations will be in December and January. Two major grants to benefit India were announced during Mr. Gates' visit. The Gates Children's Vaccine ProgramÂ at PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) will manage a $25 million grant to work in India with the government of Andhra Pradesh on a comprehensive immunization program with the potential for replication across India. The Gates Children's Vaccine Program will work with the state ministry of health to introduce locally manufactured hepatitis B vaccines into the routine immunization program, create a name-based, computerized immunization registry, investigate the effectiveness of a new vaccine against some forms of infant diarrhea, and increase efforts to control outbreaks of Japanese Encephalitis.Â  For more information aboutÂ The Gates Children's Vaccine Program at PATH, visit the website. The Gandhi Institute of Computer EducationÂ will receive $5 million to expand its national program of free computer training to underprivileged populations from the current level of eight centers serving 8,000 students each year to a target of 50 centers serving close to 50,000 students annually. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has made vaccine-preventable diseases a priority for its Global Health Program. The Foundation has committed more than $1 billion dollars in vaccine-related grants. In November, the Foundation committed $750 million to the Global Fund for Children's Vaccines, which will work closely with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), an international partnership, to strengthen routine immunization.

Kennedy Jr. spoke out about Bill Gatesâ€™s plan for mandatory global vaccination against the CCP Virus, citing the disasters caused in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people by his vaccination campaigns. Bill Gates was criticized for not being a scientist or a politician and just for just using the power of his billions, he went on to determine the fate of the billions of people he intends to vaccinate. Gates mentioned in recent interviews that the only solution to the current situation is a new universal vaccine. â€œYou know itâ€™s so important to get, not just hundreds of millions, but literally billions of those vaccines, because this is a global problem,â€ Gates   CBS. Kennedy, a lawyer, and environmentalist who opposes the controversial use of vaccines spoke out about Gatesâ€™s actions through his foundation. â€œVaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feeds his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoftâ€™s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and gives him dictatorial control over global health policyâ€”the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism,â€ Kennedy accused in his Instagram  . He also points out that Gatesâ€™s polio vaccination campaigns paralyzed 496,000 children in India between 2000 and 2017, causing his agency to be expelled from India and immediately lowering polio paralysis rates. Other disastrous effects of Gatesâ€™s vaccinations were the autoimmune and fertility disorders that 1,200 girls suffered and the death of seven of them. They belonged to a group of 23,000 vaccinated girls from remote villages in India. Among the resources used by Gatesâ€™s organization to enable the girls to be vaccinated were unethical practices such as pressuring girls to participate in the trial, intimidating parents, falsifying consent forms, and denying medical care to injured girls, according to the case now before the Indian Supreme Court, according to Kennedy. Gates himself said at TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design) talk, â€œNow if we do a great job on new vaccines,â€ the world population could be reduced. A month earlier he had pledged $10 billion to the World Health Organization (WHO) for that purpose. In 2014, the WHO was accused of sterilizing millions of women in Kenya, through deception, and the evidence was found in the vaccines used. The WHO admitted that it had been working on that project for more than 10 years. Similar charges have been brought against the WHO in countries such as Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines. Gates is also accused of controlling international organizations such as the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF), the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), and the international health organization PATH, in addition to using their money to advance their projects and silencing those who reject mass vaccinations. In addition, the Gates Foundation, owned by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, is linked to more than 20 major international pharmaceutical companies and laboratories, to which it also donates money. These donations, which generate billions of dollars in tax deductions, create conflicts of interest. While the preventive effects of vaccines are not in question, there are many complaints about the lack of transparency in their effects and content. One of the most adverse components found in vaccines is mercury, such as thimerosal, a potent neurotoxin. In recent years children have receivedâ€”through vaccinesâ€”doses of mercury 250 times higher than the safe limit for humans, unnecessarily. There is also a high increase in autism in children. In 2014, 1.08 million children were diagnosed in the United States. Dr. Doreen Granpeesheh, founder of the Center for Autism and Related Conditions in the documentary Vaxxed, explains that the incidence of autism in 1978 was 1 case per 15,000 children, very rare, and by 2014 was 1 case in every 50 children. By 2014, each child received about 46 vaccinations in the United States. â€œSince the early 1990s the increase in cases has been so high and so rapid that it made me feel like I wasnâ€™t going to be able to keep up,â€ Granpeesheh said. It now it appears that Gates has found in the pandemic caused by the CCP Virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, an important opportunity to give a big push to the project he has cherished for decades. \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," .. ... \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","     \n","     \n","     \n","     \n","     \n","     \n","text1 everyone was lied to Fact! tested a polio vax in India between 2000 & 2017 and paralysed 496,000 chlidren. \n","text2 Robert F.

Brenner found that in a five-year period, a 1.4% rise in unemployment added about 30,000 deaths due to suicides (1,540), homicides (1,740), liver disease (870) and cardiovascular/kidney disease (26,440). Factoring in Americaâ€™s growing population, a   estimated the added deaths to be 58,000.

Tony Evers signed aÂ sweeping coronavirus relief package Wednesday after lawmakers approved it with just two days to spare before the state would have lostÂ out on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal help. The Democratic governor signed the bill, which also suspends a one-week waiting period to receive unemployment benefits, two hours after state senators unanimously approved it. The overall measure was championed by both parties despite aÂ cloud of criticism over a last-minute amendment from Republicans that scaled back their original planÂ to offer more worker'sÂ compensation protection for first responders. Evers called the legislation a step forward, but short of what the state needs. He called on lawmakers to provide hazard pay to health care and child care workers as well as assistance to farmers andÂ shuttered businesses. \"This bill is finally a step in the right direction, but there is much more work to be done,\"Â he said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald called the decisions lawmakers have to make â€œgut-wrenchingâ€ and said they may do more to respond to the virus. â€œThis bill isnâ€™t perfect and it might be the first bill of a number that we are going to have to pass in the Legislature,â€ the Juneau RepublicanÂ said. â€œBut it is timelyÂ and I think itâ€™s been well thought out, and I think it will help.â€ The bill passed the Assembly 97-2 on TuesdayÂ and the Senate 31-0 on Wednesday. Democratic Sen.Â Lena Taylor of MilwaukeeÂ didn't cast a vote on the bill after complaining that she wasn't allowed to speak during Wednesday'sÂ session.Â  Republicans in the Assembly on Tuesday weakened the bill's workers' compensation protections for first responders who become infected. That prompted outrage from groups representing police officers and firefighters.Â  Instead of making workers' compensation benefits available to all health care workers, the amended legislation willÂ provide them only to police officers, firefighters and health care workers who treatÂ people with coronavirusÂ if they can prove they were exposed to the illness while working onÂ a person diagnosed with the virus. Union officials who represent police and firefighters say the bill's bar for workers' compensation isÂ too high to meet to cover all affected workers who are risking their livesÂ to do their jobs.Â  \"The law will presume that a first responderâ€™s COVID-19 injuries are caused by their employment as long as they can prove it,\" Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, tweeted. \"Thanks for nothing.\" But Republicans who control the Legislature say the measure limits costs for taxpayers, who are already suffering under the economic downturn.Â  \"It does address first responders, but not in a manner that meets the expectation of unions,\" Mike Mikalsen, spokesman for Republican Sen. Steve Nass, tweeted to Palmer late Tuesday. \"There are families out there paying taxes but have already lost jobs or watching a lifetime of building a business get destroyed in just weeks. A little perspective please!\" While Assembly Democrats criticized the measure, none in the Senate mentioned it. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, who oversees the state's Department of Justice and sets standards for law enforcement officers,Â raised concerns about the provision.Â  â€œWe should be doing more to support these essential workers than simply ensuring that theyâ€™re able to receive workers' compensation benefits if they contract COVID-19,\" he said in a statement. \"But, because of an amendment that gutted a protection for first responders that originally had been included in the coronavirus bill, the legislation that passed the state Legislature doesnâ€™t even do that.\" Lawmakers waited until the last week they could to pass legislation to take advantage of federal aid to help pay for the skyrocketing costs state governments are facing as thousands become sick and unemployed.Â Â  Until this week,Â Wisconsin had been in a minority of states that hadn't yet passed measures related to the coronavirus pandemic.Â Â  RepublicanÂ leaders waited until April 1 to begin writing legislation, according to drafting records related to the relief package â€” a month after the virus began to spread in Wisconsin and a week and a half afterÂ the governor first proposed a bill to legislative leaders. The bill wasn't released until Monday and taken up Tuesday by the Assembly. With a Friday deadline for Evers' signature, lawmakers gave themselves no time to make any changes.Â  Unlike Evers' proposal, the bill passed this week doesn't spend any state money. Republican lawmakers said Evers' plan was too costly and the state could rely on aboutÂ $2 billion in federal help to respond to the pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling said the Legislature should be doing more, including providing assistance to hospitals facing rising caseloads and businesses that have closed because of coronavirus. â€œMany in the majority party continue to downplay the significance of this crisis,â€ the La Crosse Democrat said. â€œIt is disappointing that the plan before us today is limited in scope.â€ This week's sessions were the first the Legislature has held virtually. Shilling and Senate President Roger Roth, R-Appleton, were in one room of the Capitol, with the other 31 senators videoconferencing into the session from other parts of the Capitol or their homes.Â  Roth said after the session that the computer equipment should be kept in the room he and Shilling used in case another virtual session is held.Â  The bill approved WednesdayÂ suspends the one-week waiting period before people who are out of work may collect unemployment benefits. It also allows the state to receive an extra $150 million for health care programs for every fiscal quarter that the pandemic persists. The new law also provides insurance protection for those infected with coronavirus and shields health care providers from liability. To help keep down peopleâ€™s insurance medical costs, the law bars insurers from charging people more to get treatment for coronavirus when they go to out-of-network providers. It also prohibitsÂ insurers from discriminating against people based on whether they have had coronavirus.Â  All insurers will be required to cover coronavirus testing for free. The law also suspends accountability requirements for public and private schools for the current school year. \n","text1 we passed one of the first (COVID-19) bills in the entire country, empowering Gov.

Evers called the legislation a step forward, but short of what the state needs. He called on lawmakers to provide hazard pay to health care and child care workers as well as assistance to farmers andÂ shuttered businesses. \"This bill is finally a step in the right direction, but there is much more work to be done,\"Â he said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald called the decisions lawmakers have to make â€œgut-wrenchingâ€ and said they may do more to respond to the virus. â€œThis bill isnâ€™t perfect and it might be the first bill of a number that we are going to have to pass in the Legislature,â€ the Juneau RepublicanÂ said. â€œBut it is timelyÂ and I think itâ€™s been well thought out, and I think it will help.â€ The bill passed the Assembly 97-2 on TuesdayÂ and the Senate 31-0 on Wednesday. Democratic Sen.Â Lena Taylor of MilwaukeeÂ didn't cast a vote on the bill after complaining that she wasn't allowed to speak during Wednesday'sÂ session.Â  Republicans in the Assembly on Tuesday weakened the bill's workers' compensation protections for first responders who become infected. That prompted outrage from groups representing police officers and firefighters.Â  Instead of making workers' compensation benefits available to all health care workers, the amended legislation willÂ provide them only to police officers, firefighters and health care workers who treatÂ people with coronavirusÂ if they can prove they were exposed to the illness while working onÂ a person diagnosed with the virus. Union officials who represent police and firefighters say the bill's bar for workers' compensation isÂ too high to meet to cover all affected workers who are risking their livesÂ to do their jobs.Â  \"The law will presume that a first responderâ€™s COVID-19 injuries are caused by their employment as long as they can prove it,\" Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, tweeted. \"Thanks for nothing.\" But Republicans who control the Legislature say the measure limits costs for taxpayers, who are already suffering under the economic downturn.Â  \"It does address first responders, but not in a manner that meets the expectation of unions,\" Mike Mikalsen, spokesman for Republican Sen. Steve Nass, tweeted to Palmer late Tuesday. \"There are families out there paying taxes but have already lost jobs or watching a lifetime of building a business get destroyed in just weeks. A little perspective please!\" While Assembly Democrats criticized the measure, none in the Senate mentioned it. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, who oversees the state's Department of Justice and sets standards for law enforcement officers,Â raised concerns about the provision.Â  â€œWe should be doing more to support these essential workers than simply ensuring that theyâ€™re able to receive workers' compensation benefits if they contract COVID-19,\" he said in a statement. \"But, because of an amendment that gutted a protection for first responders that originally had been included in the coronavirus bill, the legislation that passed the state Legislature doesnâ€™t even do that.\" Lawmakers waited until the last week they could to pass legislation to take advantage of federal aid to help pay for the skyrocketing costs state governments are facing as thousands become sick and unemployed.Â Â  Until this week,Â Wisconsin had been in a minority of states that hadn't yet passed measures related to the coronavirus pandemic.Â Â  RepublicanÂ leaders waited until April 1 to begin writing legislation, according to drafting records related to the relief package â€” a month after the virus began to spread in Wisconsin and a week and a half afterÂ the governor first proposed a bill to legislative leaders. The bill wasn't released until Monday and taken up Tuesday by the Assembly. With a Friday deadline for Evers' signature, lawmakers gave themselves no time to make any changes.Â  Unlike Evers' proposal, the bill passed this week doesn't spend any state money. Republican lawmakers said Evers' plan was too costly and the state could rely on aboutÂ $2 billion in federal help to respond to the pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling said the Legislature should be doing more, including providing assistance to hospitals facing rising caseloads and businesses that have closed because of coronavirus. â€œMany in the majority party continue to downplay the significance of this crisis,â€ the La Crosse Democrat said. â€œIt is disappointing that the plan before us today is limited in scope.â€ This week's sessions were the first the Legislature has held virtually. Shilling and Senate President Roger Roth, R-Appleton, were in one room of the Capitol, with the other 31 senators videoconferencing into the session from other parts of the Capitol or their homes.Â  Roth said after the session that the computer equipment should be kept in the room he and Shilling used in case another virtual session is held.Â  The bill approved WednesdayÂ suspends the one-week waiting period before people who are out of work may collect unemployment benefits. It also allows the state to receive an extra $150 million for health care programs for every fiscal quarter that the pandemic persists. The new law also provides insurance protection for those infected with coronavirus and shields health care providers from liability. To help keep down peopleâ€™s insurance medical costs, the law bars insurers from charging people more to get treatment for coronavirus when they go to out-of-network providers. It also prohibitsÂ insurers from discriminating against people based on whether they have had coronavirus.Â  All insurers will be required to cover coronavirus testing for free. The law also suspends accountability requirements for public and private schools for the current school year. \n","i 334\n","Y2 From   in   to Marvel's  , check out the movies we're still waiting to see in 2021.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging disease that was first reported in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002. The disease rapidly spread to at least 30 countries within months of its first appearance, and concerted worldwide efforts led to the identification of the etiological agent as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel member of the family  [ ]. Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV [ , ] confirmed that this pathogen is not closely related to any of the previously established coronavirus groups. Budding of the SARS-CoV occurs in the Golgi apparatus [ ] and results in the incorporation of the envelope spike glycoprotein into the virion. The spike glycoprotein is a type I membrane protein that facilitates viral attachment to the cellular receptor and initiation of infection, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional cellular receptor of SARS-CoV [ ]. We have recently shown that the processing of the spike protein was effected by furin-like convertases and that inhibition of this cleavage by a specific inhibitor abrogated cytopathicity and significantly reduced the virus titer of SARS-CoV [ ]. Due to the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the potential for rapid spread of the disease, and the absence of proven effective and safe  inhibitors of the virus, it is important to identify drugs that can effectively be used to treat or prevent potential SARS-CoV infections. Many novel therapeutic approaches have been evaluated in laboratory studies of SARS-CoV: notable among these approaches are those using siRNA [ ], passive antibody transfer [ ], DNA vaccination [ ], vaccinia or parainfluenza virus expressing the spike protein [ , ], interferons [ , ], and monoclonal antibody to the S1-subunit of the spike glycoprotein that blocks receptor binding [ ]. In this report, we describe the identification of chloroquine as an effective pre- and post-infection antiviral agent for SARS-CoV. Chloroquine, a 9-aminoquinoline that was identified in 1934, is a weak base that increases the pH of acidic vesicles. When added extracellularly, the non-protonated portion of chloroquine enters the cell, where it becomes protonated and concentrated in acidic, low-pH organelles, such as endosomes, Golgi vesicles, and lysosomes. Chloroquine can affect virus infection in many ways, and the antiviral effect depends in part on the extent to which the virus utilizes endosomes for entry. Chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [ ]. Together with data presented here, showing virus inhibition in cell culture by chloroquine doses compatible with patient treatment, these features suggest that further evaluation of chloroquine in animal models of SARS-CoV infection would be warranted as we progress toward finding effective antivirals for prevention or treatment of the disease. In order to investigate if chloroquine might prevent SARS-CoV infection, permissive Vero E6 cells [ ] were pretreated with various concentrations of chloroquine (0.1â€“10 Î¼M) for 20â€“24 h prior to virus infection. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV, and virus antigens were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods. Microscopic examination (Fig.  ) of the control cells (untreated, infected) revealed extensive SARS-CoV-specific immunostaining of the monolayer. A dose-dependant decrease in virus antigen-positive cells was observed starting at 0.1 Î¼M chloroquine, and concentrations of 10 Î¼M completely abolished SARS-CoV infection. For quantitative purposes, we counted the number of cells stained positive from three random locations on a slide. The average number of positively stained control cells was scored as 100% and was compared with the number of positive cells observed under various chloroquine concentrations (Fig.  ). Pretreatment with 0.1, 1, and 10 Î¼M chloroquine reduced infectivity by 28%, 53%, and 100%, respectively. Reproducible results were obtained from three independent experiments. These data demonstrated that pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with chloroquine rendered these cells refractory to SARS-CoV infection. . Vero E6 cells pre-treated with chloroquine for 20 hrs. Chloroquine-containing media were removed and the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline before they were infected with SARS-CoV (0.5 multiplicity of infection) for 1 h. in the absence of chloroquine. Virus was then removed and the cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 16â€“18 h in the absence of chloroquine. SARS-CoV antigens were stained with virus-specific HMAF, followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies.  The concentration of chloroquine used is indicated on the top of each panel.  SARS-CoV antigen-positive cells at three random locations were captured by using a digital camera, the number of antigen-positive cells was determined, and the average inhibition was calculated. Percent inhibition was obtained by considering the untreated control as 0% inhibition. The vertical bars represent the range of SEM. In order to investigate the antiviral properties of chloroquine on SARS-CoV after the initiation of infection, Vero E6 cells were infected with the virus and fresh medium supplemented with various concentrations of chloroquine was added immediately after virus adsorption. Infected cells were incubated for an additional 16â€“18 h, after which the presence of virus antigens was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. When chloroquine was added after the initiation of infection, there was a dramatic dose-dependant decrease in the number of virus antigen-positive cells (Fig.  ). As little as 0.1â€“1 Î¼M chloroquine reduced the infection by 50% and up to 90â€“94% inhibition was observed with 33â€“100 Î¼M concentrations (Fig.  ). At concentrations of chloroquine in excess of 1 Î¼M, only a small number of individual cells were initially infected, and the spread of the infection to adjacent cells was all but eliminated. A half-maximal inhibitory effect was estimated to occur at 4.4 Â± 1.0 Î¼M chloroquine (Fig.  ). These data clearly show that addition of chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV if the drug is added immediately following virus adsorption. . Vero E6 cells were seeded and infected as described for Fig. 1 except that chloroquine was added only after virus adsorption. Cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing chloroquine for 16â€“18 h, after which they were processed for immunofluorescence.  The concentration of chloroquine is indicated on the top.  Percent inhibition and SEM were calculated as in Fig. 1B.  The effective dose (ED ) was calculated using commercially available software (Grafit, version 4, Erithacus Software). Electron microscopic analysis indicated the appearance of significant amounts of extracellular virus particles 5â€“6 h after infection [ ]. Since we observed antiviral effects by chloroquine immediately after virus adsorption, we further extended the analysis by adding chloroquine 3 and 5 h after virus adsorption and examined for the presence of virus antigens after 20 h. We found that chloroquine was still significantly effective even when added 5 h after infection (Fig.  ); however, to obtain equivalent antiviral effect, a higher concentration of chloroquine was required if the drug was added 3 or 5 h after adsorption. . This experiment is similar to that depicted in Fig. 2 except that cells were infected at 1 multiplicity of infection, and chloroquine (10, 25, and 50 Î¼M) was added 3 or 5 h after infection. Since chloroquine inhibited SARS-CoV infection when added before or after infection, we hypothesized that another common lysosomotropic agent, NH Cl, might also function in a similar manner. Ammonium chloride has been widely used in studies addressing endosome-mediated virus entry. Coincidently, NH Cl was recently shown to reduce the transduction of pseudotype viruses decorated with SARS-CoV spike protein [ , ]. In an attempt to examine if NH Cl functions similarly to chloroquine, we performed infection analyses in Vero E6 cells before (Fig.  ) and after (Fig.  ) they were treated with various concentrations of NH Cl. In both cases, we observed a 93â€“99% inhibition with NH Cl at â‰¥ 5 mM. These data indicated that NH Cl (â‰¥ 5 mM) and chloroquine (â‰¥ 10 Î¼M) are very effective in reducing SARS-CoV infection. These results suggest that effects of chloroquine and NH Cl in controlling SARS CoV infection and spread might be mediated by similar mechanism(s). . NH Cl was added to the cells either before (A) or after (B) infection, similar to what was done for chloroquine in Figs 1 and 2. Antigen-positive cells were counted, and the results were presented as in Fig. 1B. We performed additional experiments to elucidate the mechanism of SARS-CoV inhibition by chloroquine and NH Cl. Since intra-vesicular acidic pH regulates cellular functions, including N-glycosylation trimming, cellular trafficking, and various enzymatic activities, it was of interest to characterize the effect of both drugs on the processing, glycosylation, and cellular sorting of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor, ACE2. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on Vero E6 cells that were either untreated or treated with highly effective anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of chloroquine or NH Cl. The results revealed that neither drug caused a significant change in the levels of cell-surface ACE2, indicating that the observed inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV infection are not due to the lack of available cell-surface ACE2 (Fig.  ). We next analyzed the molecular forms of endogenous ACE2 in untreated Vero E6 cells and in cells that were pre-incubated for 1 h with various concentrations of either NH Cl (2.5â€“10 mM) or chloroquine (1 and 10 Î¼M) and labeled with  S-(Met) for 3 h in the presence or absence of the drugs (Fig.   and  ). Under normal conditions, we observed two immunoreactive ACE2 forms, migrating at ~105 and ~113 kDa, respectively (Fig.  , lane 1). The ~105-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H sensitive, suggesting that it represents the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized form, whereas the ~113-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H resistant and represents the Golgi-modified form of ACE2 [ ]. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by displacing the immunoreactive protein bands with excess cold-soluble human recombinant ACE2 (+ rhACE2; Fig.  , lane 2). When we analyzed ACE2 forms in the presence of NH Cl, a clear stepwise increase in the migration of the ~113-kDa protein was observed with increasing concentrations of NH Cl, with a maximal effect observed at 10 mM NH Cl, resulting in only the ER form of ACE2 being visible on the gel (Fig.  , compare lanes 3â€“5). This suggested that the trimming and/or terminal modifications of the N-glycosylated chains of ACE2 were affected by NH Cl treatment. In addition, at 10 mM NH Cl, the ER form of ACE2 migrated with slightly faster mobility, indicating that NH Cl at that concentration might also affect core glycosylation. We also examined the terminal glycosylation status of ACE2 when the cells were treated with chloroquine (Fig.  ). Similar to NH Cl, a stepwise increase in the electrophoretic mobility of ACE2 was observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine. At 25 Î¼M chloroquine, the faster electrophoretic mobility of the Golgi-modified form of ACE2 was clearly evident. On the basis of the flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation analyses, it can be inferred that NH Cl and chloroquine both impaired the terminal glycosylation of ACE2, while NH Cl resulted in a more dramatic effect. Although ACE2 is expressed in similar quantities at the cell surface, the variations in its glycosylation status might render the ACE2-SARS-CoV interaction less efficient and inhibit virus entry when the cells are treated with NH Cl and chloroquine. .  Vero E6 cells were cultured for 20 h in the absence (control) or presence of chloroquine (10 Î¼M) or NH Cl (20 mM). Cells were labeled with anti-ACE2 (grey histogram) or with a secondary antibody alone (white histogram).  Biosynthesis of ACE2 in untreated cells or in cells treated with NH Cl. Vero E6 cells were pulse-labeled for 3 h with  S-Met, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an ACE2 antibody (lane 1). Preincunbation of the antibody with recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) completely abolished the signal (lane 2). The positions of the endoglycosidase H-sensitive ER form and the endoglycosidase H-resistant Golgi form of ACE2 are emphasized. Note that the increasing concentration of NH Cl resulting in the decrease of the Golgi form of ACE2.  A similar experiment was performed in the presence of the indicated concentrations of chloroquine. Note the loss of terminal glycans with increasing concentrations of chloroquine.  The terminal glycosidic modification of ACE2 was evaluated by neuraminidase treatment of immunoprecipitated ACE2. Here cells were treated with 1â€“25 Î¼M concentrations of chloroquine during starvation, pulse, and 3-h chase. To confirm that ACE2 undergoes terminal sugar modifications and that the terminal glycosylation is affected by NH Cl or chloroquine treatment, we performed immunopreipitation of  S-labeled ACE2 and subjected the immunoprecipitates to neuraminidase digestion. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE (Fig  ). It is evident from the slightly faster mobility of the Golgi form of ACE2 after neuraminidase treatment (Fig  , compare lanes 1 and 2), that ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation; however, the ER form of ACE2 was not affected by neuraminidase. Cells treated with 10 Î¼M chloroquine did not result in a significant shift; whereas 25 Î¼M chloroquine caused the Golgi form of ACE2 to resolve similar to the neuraminidase-treated ACE2 (Fig  , compare lanes 5 and 6). These data provide evidence that ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation and that chloroquine at anti-SARS-CoV concentrations abrogates the process. We next addressed whether the lysosomotropic drugs (NH Cl and chloroquine) affect the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and/or trafficking of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. For this purpose, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV for 18 h. Chloroquine or ammonium chloride was added to these cells during while they were being starved (1 h), labeled (30 min) or chased (3 h). The cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with the SARS-specific polyclonal antibody (HMAF). The 30-min pulse results indicated that pro-spike (proS) was synthesized as a ~190-kDa precursor (proS-ER) and processed into ~125-, ~105-, and ~80-kDa proteins (Fig.  , lane 2), a result identical to that in our previous analysis [ ]. Except for the 100 Î¼M chloroquine (Fig.  , lane 3), there was no significant difference in the biosynthesis or processing of the virus spike protein in untreated or chloroquine-treated cells (Fig.  , lanes 4â€“6). It should be noted that chloroquine at 100 Î¼M resulted in an overall decrease in biosynthesis and in the levels of processed virus glycoprotein. In view of the lack of reduction in the biosynthesis and processing of the spike glycoprotein in the presence of chloroquine concentrations (10 and 50 Î¼M) that caused large reductions in SARS-CoV replication and spread, we conclude that the antiviral effect is probably not due to alteration of virus glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing. Similar analyses were performed with NH Cl, and the data suggested that the biosynthesis and processing of the spike protein were also not negatively affected by NH Cl (Fig.  , lanes 7â€“12). Consistent with our previous analysis [ ], we observed the presence of a larger protein, which is referred to here as oligomers. Recently, Song et al. [ ] provided evidence that these are homotrimers of the SARS-CoV spike protein and were incorporated into the virions. Interestingly, the levels of the homotrimers in cells treated with 100 Î¼M chloroquine and 40 and 20 mM NH Cl (Fig.  , lanes 3, 9, and 10) were slightly lower than in control cells or cells treated with lower drug concentrations. . Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV as described in Fig. 2. CQ or NH Cl was added during the periods of starvation (1 h) and labeling (30 min) with  S-Cys and followed by chase for 3 h in the presence of unlabeled medium. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with HMAF. Virus proteins were resolved using 3â€“8% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). The cells presented were labeled for 30 min  and chased for 3 h  . The migration positions of the various spike molecular forms are indicated at the right side, and those of the molecular standards are shown to the left side. proS-ER and proS-Golgi are the pro-spike of SARS-Co in the ER and Golgi compartments, respectively and proS-ungly is the unglycosylated pro-spike ER. The data obtained from a 30-min pulse followed by a 3-h chase (Fig.  , lanes 2 and 8) confirmed our earlier observation that the SARS-CoV spike protein precursor (proS-ER) acquires Golgi-specific modifications (proS-Golgi) resulting in a ~210-kDa protein [ ]. Chloroquine at 10, 25, and 50 Î¼M had no substantial negative impact on the appearance of the Golgi form (Fig.  , compare lane 2 to lanes 4â€“6). Only at 100 Î¼M chloroquine was a reduction in the level of the Golgi-modified pro-spike observed (lane 3). On the other hand, NH Cl abrogated the appearance of Golgi-modified forms at â‰¥10 mM (compare lane 8 with 9â€“11) and had a milder effect at 1 mM (lane 12). These data clearly demonstrate that the biosynthesis and proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV spike protein are not affected at chloroquine (25 and 50 Î¼M) and NH Cl (1 mM) doses that cause virus inhibitory effects. In addition, with 40, 20, and 10 mM NH Cl, there was an increased accumulation of proS-ER with a concomitant decrease in the amount of oligomers (Fig.  , lanes 9â€“11). When we examined the homotrimers, we found that chloroquine at 100 Î¼M and NH Cl at 40 and 20 mM resulted in slightly faster mobility of the trimers (Fig.  , lanes 3, 9, and 10), but lower drug doses, which did exhibit significant antiviral effects, did not result in appreciable differences. These data suggest that the newly synthesized intracellular spike protein may not be a major target for chloroquine and NH Cl antiviral action. The faster mobility of the trimer at certain higher concentration of the drugs might be due the effect of these drugs on the terminal glycosylation of the trimers. We have identified chloroquine as an effective antiviral agent for SARS-CoV in cell culture conditions, as evidenced by its inhibitory effect when the drug was added prior to infection or after the initiation and establishment of infection. The fact that chloroquine exerts an antiviral effect during pre- and post-infection conditions suggest that it is likely to have both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages. Recently, Keyaerts et al. [ ] reported the antiviral properties of chloroquine and identified that the drug affects SARS-CoV replication in cell culture, as evidenced by quantitative RT-PCR. Taken together with the findings of Keyaerts et al. [ ], our analysis provides further evidence that chloroquine is effective against SARS-CoV Frankfurt and Urbani strains. We have provided evidence that chloroquine is effective in preventing SARS-CoV infection in cell culture if the drug is added to the cells 24 h prior to infection. In addition, chloroquine was significantly effective even when the drug was added 3â€“5 h after infection, suggesting an antiviral effect even after the establishment of infection. Since similar results were obtained by NH Cl treatment of Vero E6 cells, the underlying mechanism(s) of action of these drugs might be similar. Apart from the probable role of chloroquine on SARS-CoV replication, the mechanisms of action of chloroquine on SARS-CoV are not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested the elevation of pH as a mechanism by which chloroquine reduces the transduction of SARS-CoV pseudotype viruses [ , ]. We examined the effect of chloroquine and NH Cl on the SARS-CoV spike proteins and on its receptor, ACE2. Immunoprecipitation results of ACE2 clearly demonstrated that effective anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of chloroquine and NH Cl also impaired the terminal glycosylation of ACE2. However, the flow cytometry data demonstrated that there are no significant differences in the cell surface expression of ACE2 in cells treated with chloroquine or NH Cl. On the basis of these results, it is reasonable to suggest that the pre-treatment with NH Cl or chloroquine has possibly resulted in the surface expression of the under-glycosylated ACE2. In the case of chloroquine treatment prior to infection, the impairment of terminal glycosylation of ACE2 may result in reduced binding affinities between ACE2 and SARS-CoV spike protein and negatively influence the initiation of SARS-CoV infection. Since the biosynthesis, processing, Golgi modification, and oligomerization of the newly synthesized spike protein were not appreciably affected by anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of either chloroquine or NH Cl, we conclude that these events occur in the cell independent of the presence of the drugs. The potential contribution of these drugs in the elevation of endosomal pH and its impact on subsequent virus entry or exit could not be ruled out. A decrease in SARS-CoV pseudotype transduction in the presence of NH Cl was observed and was attributed to the effect on intracellular pH [ , ]. When chloroquine or NH Cl are added after infection, these agents can rapidly raise the pH and subvert on-going fusion events between virus and endosomes, thus inhibiting the infection. In addition, the mechanism of action of NH Cl and chloroquine might depend on when they were added to the cells. When added after the initiation of infection, these drugs might affect the endosome-mediated fusion, subsequent virus replication, or assembly and release. Previous studies of chloroquine have demonstrated that it has multiple effects on mammalian cells in addition to the elevation of endosomal pH, including the prevention of terminal glycosyaltion of immunoglobulins [ ]. When added to virus-infected cells, chloroquine inhibited later stages in vesicular stomatitis virus maturation by inhibiting the glycoprotein expression at the cell surface [ ], and it inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1 particles by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the glycoprotein [ , ]. On the basis of these properties, we suggest that the cell surface expression of under-glycosylated ACE2 and its poor affinity to SARS-CoV spike protein may be the primary mechanism by which infection is prevented by drug pretreatment of cells prior to infection. On the other hand, rapid elevation of endosomal pH and abrogation of virus-endosome fusion may be the primary mechanism by which virus infection is prevented under post-treatment conditions. More detailed SARS CoV spike-ACE2 binding assays in the presence or absence of chloroquine will be performed to confirm our findings. Our studies indicate that the impact of NH Cl and chloroquine on the ACE2 and spike protein profiles are significantly different. NH Cl exhibits a more pronounced effect than does chloroquine on terminal glycosylation, highlighting the novel intricate differences between chloroquine and ammonium chloride in affecting the protein transport or glycosylation of SARS-CoV spike protein and its receptor, ACE2, despite their well-established similar effects of endosomal pH elevation. The infectivity of coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV are also affected by chloroquine, as exemplified by the human CoV-229E [ ]. The inhibitory effects observed on SARS-CoV infectivity and cell spread occurred in the presence of 1â€“10 Î¼M chloroquine, which are plasma concentrations achievable during the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria (varying from 1.6â€“12.5 Î¼M) [ ] and hence are well tolerated by patients. It recently was speculated that chloroquine might be effective against SARS and the authors suggested that this compound might block the production of TNFÎ±, IL6, or IFNÎ³ [ ]. Our data provide evidence for the possibility of using the well-established drug chloroquine in the clinical management of SARS. Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases including malaria, amoebiosis and human immunodeficiency virus is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. The fact that the drug has significant inhibitory antiviral effect when the susceptible cells were treated either prior to or after infection suggests a possible prophylactic and therapeutic use. Vero E6 cells (an African green monkey kidney cell line) were infected with SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) medium with or without various concentrations of either chloroquine or NH Cl (both from Sigma). Immunofluorescence staining was performed with SARS-CoV-specific hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) [ ] followed by anti-mouse fluorescein-coupled antibody. Eighteen hours after infection, the virus-containing supernatants were removed, and the cells were pulsed with  S-(Cys) for 30 min and chased for 3 h before lysis in RIPA buffer. Clarified cell lysates and media were incubated with HMAF, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 3â€“8% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen); proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, cells were chased for 3 h with isotope-free medium. Clarified cell supernatants were also immunoprecipitated with SARS-CoV-specific HMAF. Vero E6 cells were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, the cells were incubated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of 10 Î¼M chloroquine or 20 mM NH Cl. To analyze the levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, cells were incubated on ice with 10 Î¼g/mL affinity-purified goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems) and then incubated with FITC-labeled swine anti-goat IgG antibody (Caltag Laboratories). Labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For ACE2 biosynthesis studies, Vero E6 cells were pulsed with 250 Î¼Ci  S-(Met) (Perkin Elmer) for 3 h with the indicated concentrations of chloroquine or NH Cl and then lysed in RIPA buffer. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D systems), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging disease that was first reported in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002. The disease rapidly spread to at least 30 countries within months of its first appearance, and concerted worldwide efforts led to the identification of the etiological agent as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel member of the family  [ ]. Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV [ , ] confirmed that this pathogen is not closely related to any of the previously established coronavirus groups. Budding of the SARS-CoV occurs in the Golgi apparatus [ ] and results in the incorporation of the envelope spike glycoprotein into the virion. The spike glycoprotein is a type I membrane protein that facilitates viral attachment to the cellular receptor and initiation of infection, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional cellular receptor of SARS-CoV [ ]. We have recently shown that the processing of the spike protein was effected by furin-like convertases and that inhibition of this cleavage by a specific inhibitor abrogated cytopathicity and significantly reduced the virus titer of SARS-CoV [ ]. Due to the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the potential for rapid spread of the disease, and the absence of proven effective and safe  inhibitors of the virus, it is important to identify drugs that can effectively be used to treat or prevent potential SARS-CoV infections. Many novel therapeutic approaches have been evaluated in laboratory studies of SARS-CoV: notable among these approaches are those using siRNA [ ], passive antibody transfer [ ], DNA vaccination [ ], vaccinia or parainfluenza virus expressing the spike protein [ , ], interferons [ , ], and monoclonal antibody to the S1-subunit of the spike glycoprotein that blocks receptor binding [ ]. In this report, we describe the identification of chloroquine as an effective pre- and post-infection antiviral agent for SARS-CoV. Chloroquine, a 9-aminoquinoline that was identified in 1934, is a weak base that increases the pH of acidic vesicles. When added extracellularly, the non-protonated portion of chloroquine enters the cell, where it becomes protonated and concentrated in acidic, low-pH organelles, such as endosomes, Golgi vesicles, and lysosomes. Chloroquine can affect virus infection in many ways, and the antiviral effect depends in part on the extent to which the virus utilizes endosomes for entry. Chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [ ]. Together with data presented here, showing virus inhibition in cell culture by chloroquine doses compatible with patient treatment, these features suggest that further evaluation of chloroquine in animal models of SARS-CoV infection would be warranted as we progress toward finding effective antivirals for prevention or treatment of the disease. In order to investigate if chloroquine might prevent SARS-CoV infection, permissive Vero E6 cells [ ] were pretreated with various concentrations of chloroquine (0.1â€“10 Î¼M) for 20â€“24 h prior to virus infection. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV, and virus antigens were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods. Microscopic examination (Fig.  ) of the control cells (untreated, infected) revealed extensive SARS-CoV-specific immunostaining of the monolayer. A dose-dependant decrease in virus antigen-positive cells was observed starting at 0.1 Î¼M chloroquine, and concentrations of 10 Î¼M completely abolished SARS-CoV infection. For quantitative purposes, we counted the number of cells stained positive from three random locations on a slide. The average number of positively stained control cells was scored as 100% and was compared with the number of positive cells observed under various chloroquine concentrations (Fig.  ). Pretreatment with 0.1, 1, and 10 Î¼M chloroquine reduced infectivity by 28%, 53%, and 100%, respectively. Reproducible results were obtained from three independent experiments. These data demonstrated that pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with chloroquine rendered these cells refractory to SARS-CoV infection. . Vero E6 cells pre-treated with chloroquine for 20 hrs. Chloroquine-containing media were removed and the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline before they were infected with SARS-CoV (0.5 multiplicity of infection) for 1 h. in the absence of chloroquine. Virus was then removed and the cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 16â€“18 h in the absence of chloroquine. SARS-CoV antigens were stained with virus-specific HMAF, followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies.  The concentration of chloroquine used is indicated on the top of each panel.  SARS-CoV antigen-positive cells at three random locations were captured by using a digital camera, the number of antigen-positive cells was determined, and the average inhibition was calculated. Percent inhibition was obtained by considering the untreated control as 0% inhibition. The vertical bars represent the range of SEM. In order to investigate the antiviral properties of chloroquine on SARS-CoV after the initiation of infection, Vero E6 cells were infected with the virus and fresh medium supplemented with various concentrations of chloroquine was added immediately after virus adsorption. Infected cells were incubated for an additional 16â€“18 h, after which the presence of virus antigens was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. When chloroquine was added after the initiation of infection, there was a dramatic dose-dependant decrease in the number of virus antigen-positive cells (Fig.  ). As little as 0.1â€“1 Î¼M chloroquine reduced the infection by 50% and up to 90â€“94% inhibition was observed with 33â€“100 Î¼M concentrations (Fig.  ). At concentrations of chloroquine in excess of 1 Î¼M, only a small number of individual cells were initially infected, and the spread of the infection to adjacent cells was all but eliminated. A half-maximal inhibitory effect was estimated to occur at 4.4 Â± 1.0 Î¼M chloroquine (Fig.  ). These data clearly show that addition of chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV if the drug is added immediately following virus adsorption. . Vero E6 cells were seeded and infected as described for Fig. 1 except that chloroquine was added only after virus adsorption. Cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing chloroquine for 16â€“18 h, after which they were processed for immunofluorescence.  The concentration of chloroquine is indicated on the top.  Percent inhibition and SEM were calculated as in Fig. 1B.  The effective dose (ED ) was calculated using commercially available software (Grafit, version 4, Erithacus Software). Electron microscopic analysis indicated the appearance of significant amounts of extracellular virus particles 5â€“6 h after infection [ ]. Since we observed antiviral effects by chloroquine immediately after virus adsorption, we further extended the analysis by adding chloroquine 3 and 5 h after virus adsorption and examined for the presence of virus antigens after 20 h. We found that chloroquine was still significantly effective even when added 5 h after infection (Fig.  ); however, to obtain equivalent antiviral effect, a higher concentration of chloroquine was required if the drug was added 3 or 5 h after adsorption. . This experiment is similar to that depicted in Fig. 2 except that cells were infected at 1 multiplicity of infection, and chloroquine (10, 25, and 50 Î¼M) was added 3 or 5 h after infection. Since chloroquine inhibited SARS-CoV infection when added before or after infection, we hypothesized that another common lysosomotropic agent, NH Cl, might also function in a similar manner. Ammonium chloride has been widely used in studies addressing endosome-mediated virus entry. Coincidently, NH Cl was recently shown to reduce the transduction of pseudotype viruses decorated with SARS-CoV spike protein [ , ]. In an attempt to examine if NH Cl functions similarly to chloroquine, we performed infection analyses in Vero E6 cells before (Fig.  ) and after (Fig.  ) they were treated with various concentrations of NH Cl. In both cases, we observed a 93â€“99% inhibition with NH Cl at â‰¥ 5 mM. These data indicated that NH Cl (â‰¥ 5 mM) and chloroquine (â‰¥ 10 Î¼M) are very effective in reducing SARS-CoV infection. These results suggest that effects of chloroquine and NH Cl in controlling SARS CoV infection and spread might be mediated by similar mechanism(s). . NH Cl was added to the cells either before (A) or after (B) infection, similar to what was done for chloroquine in Figs 1 and 2. Antigen-positive cells were counted, and the results were presented as in Fig. 1B. We performed additional experiments to elucidate the mechanism of SARS-CoV inhibition by chloroquine and NH Cl. Since intra-vesicular acidic pH regulates cellular functions, including N-glycosylation trimming, cellular trafficking, and various enzymatic activities, it was of interest to characterize the effect of both drugs on the processing, glycosylation, and cellular sorting of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor, ACE2. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on Vero E6 cells that were either untreated or treated with highly effective anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of chloroquine or NH Cl. The results revealed that neither drug caused a significant change in the levels of cell-surface ACE2, indicating that the observed inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV infection are not due to the lack of available cell-surface ACE2 (Fig.  ). We next analyzed the molecular forms of endogenous ACE2 in untreated Vero E6 cells and in cells that were pre-incubated for 1 h with various concentrations of either NH Cl (2.5â€“10 mM) or chloroquine (1 and 10 Î¼M) and labeled with  S-(Met) for 3 h in the presence or absence of the drugs (Fig.   and  ). Under normal conditions, we observed two immunoreactive ACE2 forms, migrating at ~105 and ~113 kDa, respectively (Fig.  , lane 1). The ~105-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H sensitive, suggesting that it represents the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized form, whereas the ~113-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H resistant and represents the Golgi-modified form of ACE2 [ ]. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by displacing the immunoreactive protein bands with excess cold-soluble human recombinant ACE2 (+ rhACE2; Fig.  , lane 2). When we analyzed ACE2 forms in the presence of NH Cl, a clear stepwise increase in the migration of the ~113-kDa protein was observed with increasing concentrations of NH Cl, with a maximal effect observed at 10 mM NH Cl, resulting in only the ER form of ACE2 being visible on the gel (Fig.  , compare lanes 3â€“5). This suggested that the trimming and/or terminal modifications of the N-glycosylated chains of ACE2 were affected by NH Cl treatment. In addition, at 10 mM NH Cl, the ER form of ACE2 migrated with slightly faster mobility, indicating that NH Cl at that concentration might also affect core glycosylation. We also examined the terminal glycosylation status of ACE2 when the cells were treated with chloroquine (Fig.  ). Similar to NH Cl, a stepwise increase in the electrophoretic mobility of ACE2 was observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine. At 25 Î¼M chloroquine, the faster electrophoretic mobility of the Golgi-modified form of ACE2 was clearly evident. On the basis of the flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation analyses, it can be inferred that NH Cl and chloroquine both impaired the terminal glycosylation of ACE2, while NH Cl resulted in a more dramatic effect. Although ACE2 is expressed in similar quantities at the cell surface, the variations in its glycosylation status might render the ACE2-SARS-CoV interaction less efficient and inhibit virus entry when the cells are treated with NH Cl and chloroquine. .  Vero E6 cells were cultured for 20 h in the absence (control) or presence of chloroquine (10 Î¼M) or NH Cl (20 mM). Cells were labeled with anti-ACE2 (grey histogram) or with a secondary antibody alone (white histogram).  Biosynthesis of ACE2 in untreated cells or in cells treated with NH Cl. Vero E6 cells were pulse-labeled for 3 h with  S-Met, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an ACE2 antibody (lane 1). Preincunbation of the antibody with recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) completely abolished the signal (lane 2). The positions of the endoglycosidase H-sensitive ER form and the endoglycosidase H-resistant Golgi form of ACE2 are emphasized. Note that the increasing concentration of NH Cl resulting in the decrease of the Golgi form of ACE2.  A similar experiment was performed in the presence of the indicated concentrations of chloroquine. Note the loss of terminal glycans with increasing concentrations of chloroquine.  The terminal glycosidic modification of ACE2 was evaluated by neuraminidase treatment of immunoprecipitated ACE2. Here cells were treated with 1â€“25 Î¼M concentrations of chloroquine during starvation, pulse, and 3-h chase. To confirm that ACE2 undergoes terminal sugar modifications and that the terminal glycosylation is affected by NH Cl or chloroquine treatment, we performed immunopreipitation of  S-labeled ACE2 and subjected the immunoprecipitates to neuraminidase digestion. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE (Fig  ). It is evident from the slightly faster mobility of the Golgi form of ACE2 after neuraminidase treatment (Fig  , compare lanes 1 and 2), that ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation; however, the ER form of ACE2 was not affected by neuraminidase. Cells treated with 10 Î¼M chloroquine did not result in a significant shift; whereas 25 Î¼M chloroquine caused the Golgi form of ACE2 to resolve similar to the neuraminidase-treated ACE2 (Fig  , compare lanes 5 and 6). These data provide evidence that ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation and that chloroquine at anti-SARS-CoV concentrations abrogates the process. We next addressed whether the lysosomotropic drugs (NH Cl and chloroquine) affect the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and/or trafficking of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. For this purpose, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV for 18 h. Chloroquine or ammonium chloride was added to these cells during while they were being starved (1 h), labeled (30 min) or chased (3 h). The cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with the SARS-specific polyclonal antibody (HMAF). The 30-min pulse results indicated that pro-spike (proS) was synthesized as a ~190-kDa precursor (proS-ER) and processed into ~125-, ~105-, and ~80-kDa proteins (Fig.  , lane 2), a result identical to that in our previous analysis [ ]. Except for the 100 Î¼M chloroquine (Fig.  , lane 3), there was no significant difference in the biosynthesis or processing of the virus spike protein in untreated or chloroquine-treated cells (Fig.  , lanes 4â€“6). It should be noted that chloroquine at 100 Î¼M resulted in an overall decrease in biosynthesis and in the levels of processed virus glycoprotein. In view of the lack of reduction in the biosynthesis and processing of the spike glycoprotein in the presence of chloroquine concentrations (10 and 50 Î¼M) that caused large reductions in SARS-CoV replication and spread, we conclude that the antiviral effect is probably not due to alteration of virus glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing. Similar analyses were performed with NH Cl, and the data suggested that the biosynthesis and processing of the spike protein were also not negatively affected by NH Cl (Fig.  , lanes 7â€“12). Consistent with our previous analysis [ ], we observed the presence of a larger protein, which is referred to here as oligomers. Recently, Song et al. [ ] provided evidence that these are homotrimers of the SARS-CoV spike protein and were incorporated into the virions. Interestingly, the levels of the homotrimers in cells treated with 100 Î¼M chloroquine and 40 and 20 mM NH Cl (Fig.  , lanes 3, 9, and 10) were slightly lower than in control cells or cells treated with lower drug concentrations. . Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV as described in Fig. 2. CQ or NH Cl was added during the periods of starvation (1 h) and labeling (30 min) with  S-Cys and followed by chase for 3 h in the presence of unlabeled medium. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with HMAF. Virus proteins were resolved using 3â€“8% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). The cells presented were labeled for 30 min  and chased for 3 h  . The migration positions of the various spike molecular forms are indicated at the right side, and those of the molecular standards are shown to the left side. proS-ER and proS-Golgi are the pro-spike of SARS-Co in the ER and Golgi compartments, respectively and proS-ungly is the unglycosylated pro-spike ER. The data obtained from a 30-min pulse followed by a 3-h chase (Fig.  , lanes 2 and 8) confirmed our earlier observation that the SARS-CoV spike protein precursor (proS-ER) acquires Golgi-specific modifications (proS-Golgi) resulting in a ~210-kDa protein [ ]. Chloroquine at 10, 25, and 50 Î¼M had no substantial negative impact on the appearance of the Golgi form (Fig.  , compare lane 2 to lanes 4â€“6). Only at 100 Î¼M chloroquine was a reduction in the level of the Golgi-modified pro-spike observed (lane 3). On the other hand, NH Cl abrogated the appearance of Golgi-modified forms at â‰¥10 mM (compare lane 8 with 9â€“11) and had a milder effect at 1 mM (lane 12). These data clearly demonstrate that the biosynthesis and proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV spike protein are not affected at chloroquine (25 and 50 Î¼M) and NH Cl (1 mM) doses that cause virus inhibitory effects. In addition, with 40, 20, and 10 mM NH Cl, there was an increased accumulation of proS-ER with a concomitant decrease in the amount of oligomers (Fig.  , lanes 9â€“11). When we examined the homotrimers, we found that chloroquine at 100 Î¼M and NH Cl at 40 and 20 mM resulted in slightly faster mobility of the trimers (Fig.  , lanes 3, 9, and 10), but lower drug doses, which did exhibit significant antiviral effects, did not result in appreciable differences. These data suggest that the newly synthesized intracellular spike protein may not be a major target for chloroquine and NH Cl antiviral action. The faster mobility of the trimer at certain higher concentration of the drugs might be due the effect of these drugs on the terminal glycosylation of the trimers. We have identified chloroquine as an effective antiviral agent for SARS-CoV in cell culture conditions, as evidenced by its inhibitory effect when the drug was added prior to infection or after the initiation and establishment of infection. The fact that chloroquine exerts an antiviral effect during pre- and post-infection conditions suggest that it is likely to have both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages. Recently, Keyaerts et al. [ ] reported the antiviral properties of chloroquine and identified that the drug affects SARS-CoV replication in cell culture, as evidenced by quantitative RT-PCR. Taken together with the findings of Keyaerts et al. [ ], our analysis provides further evidence that chloroquine is effective against SARS-CoV Frankfurt and Urbani strains. We have provided evidence that chloroquine is effective in preventing SARS-CoV infection in cell culture if the drug is added to the cells 24 h prior to infection. In addition, chloroquine was significantly effective even when the drug was added 3â€“5 h after infection, suggesting an antiviral effect even after the establishment of infection. Since similar results were obtained by NH Cl treatment of Vero E6 cells, the underlying mechanism(s) of action of these drugs might be similar. Apart from the probable role of chloroquine on SARS-CoV replication, the mechanisms of action of chloroquine on SARS-CoV are not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested the elevation of pH as a mechanism by which chloroquine reduces the transduction of SARS-CoV pseudotype viruses [ , ]. We examined the effect of chloroquine and NH Cl on the SARS-CoV spike proteins and on its receptor, ACE2. Immunoprecipitation results of ACE2 clearly demonstrated that effective anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of chloroquine and NH Cl also impaired the terminal glycosylation of ACE2. However, the flow cytometry data demonstrated that there are no significant differences in the cell surface expression of ACE2 in cells treated with chloroquine or NH Cl. On the basis of these results, it is reasonable to suggest that the pre-treatment with NH Cl or chloroquine has possibly resulted in the surface expression of the under-glycosylated ACE2. In the case of chloroquine treatment prior to infection, the impairment of terminal glycosylation of ACE2 may result in reduced binding affinities between ACE2 and SARS-CoV spike protein and negatively influence the initiation of SARS-CoV infection. Since the biosynthesis, processing, Golgi modification, and oligomerization of the newly synthesized spike protein were not appreciably affected by anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of either chloroquine or NH Cl, we conclude that these events occur in the cell independent of the presence of the drugs. The potential contribution of these drugs in the elevation of endosomal pH and its impact on subsequent virus entry or exit could not be ruled out. A decrease in SARS-CoV pseudotype transduction in the presence of NH Cl was observed and was attributed to the effect on intracellular pH [ , ]. When chloroquine or NH Cl are added after infection, these agents can rapidly raise the pH and subvert on-going fusion events between virus and endosomes, thus inhibiting the infection. In addition, the mechanism of action of NH Cl and chloroquine might depend on when they were added to the cells. When added after the initiation of infection, these drugs might affect the endosome-mediated fusion, subsequent virus replication, or assembly and release. Previous studies of chloroquine have demonstrated that it has multiple effects on mammalian cells in addition to the elevation of endosomal pH, including the prevention of terminal glycosyaltion of immunoglobulins [ ]. When added to virus-infected cells, chloroquine inhibited later stages in vesicular stomatitis virus maturation by inhibiting the glycoprotein expression at the cell surface [ ], and it inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1 particles by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the glycoprotein [ , ]. On the basis of these properties, we suggest that the cell surface expression of under-glycosylated ACE2 and its poor affinity to SARS-CoV spike protein may be the primary mechanism by which infection is prevented by drug pretreatment of cells prior to infection. On the other hand, rapid elevation of endosomal pH and abrogation of virus-endosome fusion may be the primary mechanism by which virus infection is prevented under post-treatment conditions. More detailed SARS CoV spike-ACE2 binding assays in the presence or absence of chloroquine will be performed to confirm our findings. Our studies indicate that the impact of NH Cl and chloroquine on the ACE2 and spike protein profiles are significantly different. NH Cl exhibits a more pronounced effect than does chloroquine on terminal glycosylation, highlighting the novel intricate differences between chloroquine and ammonium chloride in affecting the protein transport or glycosylation of SARS-CoV spike protein and its receptor, ACE2, despite their well-established similar effects of endosomal pH elevation. The infectivity of coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV are also affected by chloroquine, as exemplified by the human CoV-229E [ ]. The inhibitory effects observed on SARS-CoV infectivity and cell spread occurred in the presence of 1â€“10 Î¼M chloroquine, which are plasma concentrations achievable during the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria (varying from 1.6â€“12.5 Î¼M) [ ] and hence are well tolerated by patients. It recently was speculated that chloroquine might be effective against SARS and the authors suggested that this compound might block the production of TNFÎ±, IL6, or IFNÎ³ [ ]. Our data provide evidence for the possibility of using the well-established drug chloroquine in the clinical management of SARS. Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases including malaria, amoebiosis and human immunodeficiency virus is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. The fact that the drug has significant inhibitory antiviral effect when the susceptible cells were treated either prior to or after infection suggests a possible prophylactic and therapeutic use. Vero E6 cells (an African green monkey kidney cell line) were infected with SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) medium with or without various concentrations of either chloroquine or NH Cl (both from Sigma). Immunofluorescence staining was performed with SARS-CoV-specific hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) [ ] followed by anti-mouse fluorescein-coupled antibody. Eighteen hours after infection, the virus-containing supernatants were removed, and the cells were pulsed with  S-(Cys) for 30 min and chased for 3 h before lysis in RIPA buffer. Clarified cell lysates and media were incubated with HMAF, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 3â€“8% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen); proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, cells were chased for 3 h with isotope-free medium. Clarified cell supernatants were also immunoprecipitated with SARS-CoV-specific HMAF. Vero E6 cells were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, the cells were incubated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of 10 Î¼M chloroquine or 20 mM NH Cl. To analyze the levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, cells were incubated on ice with 10 Î¼g/mL affinity-purified goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems) and then incubated with FITC-labeled swine anti-goat IgG antibody (Caltag Laboratories). Labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For ACE2 biosynthesis studies, Vero E6 cells were pulsed with 250 Î¼Ci  S-(Met) (Perkin Elmer) for 3 h with the indicated concentrations of chloroquine or NH Cl and then lysed in RIPA buffer. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D systems), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

For video troubleshooting and help  . \n","Y2 How many Americans have died after taking the   vaccines? Not Americans whoâ€™ve been killed by the virus, thatâ€™s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the   designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. Weâ€™ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.Â  But what about the potential risks? Youâ€™d think you would know more about that than you do. We talk about vaccines constantly, not just on this show, but in this country.   was on TV yesterday talking about vaccines. He wants you to get one. Everyone in authority wants you to get one. In fact, youâ€™ve probably already had your shot, and good for you. If you havenâ€™t had your shot, youâ€™re under enormous pressure to get your shot. You understand that soon you may not be able to fly on commercial airplanes or go to work at the office or send your children to school if you donâ€™t have the shot. Meanwhile, the social pressure is enormous. Friends may have already informed you that youâ€™re not welcome at their parties or weddings if you havenâ€™t been vaccinated. There is a lot of pressure to comply. At some point, you probably will comply. Itâ€™s just too difficult not be to vaccinated in this country. Â Â  But before you make the appointment: do you know anything about the potential risks? Probably you donâ€™t know much. We all assume the risks are negligible. Vaccines arenâ€™t dangerous. Thatâ€™s not a guess, we know that pretty conclusively from the official numbers. Every flu season, we give influenza shots to more than 160 million Americans. Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.Â  Every death is tragic, but big picture, we donâ€™t consider those numbers disqualifying. We keep giving flu shots, and very few people complain about it. So the question is how do those numbers compare to the death rate from the coronavirus vaccines now being distributed across the country? Thatâ€™s worth knowing.Â  We checked today. Hereâ€™s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two â€” thatâ€™s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We donâ€™t have numbers past that, weâ€™re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that â€” perhaps vastly higher. Â  The data we just cited come from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System â€” VAERS â€” which is managed by the   and the FDA. VARES has received a lot of criticism over the years, some of it founded. Some critics have argued for a long time that VARES undercounts vaccine injuries. A report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2010 concluded that \"fewer than one percent of vaccine adverse events are reported\" by the VARES system. Fewer than one percent. So what is the real number of people who apparently have been killed or injured by the vaccine? Well, we donâ€™t know that number. Nobody does, and weâ€™re not going to speculate about it. But itâ€™s clear that what is happening now, for whatever reason, is not even close to normal. Itâ€™s not even close to what weâ€™ve seen in previous years with previous vaccines. Most vaccines are not accused of killing large numbers of people. The Menveo vaccine, for example, is given to people around the world, often children, to prevent bacterial meningitis. In this country, only one person died from that vaccine in the entire period between 2010 and 2015. One. So, compare that to whatâ€™s happening now. In just the first four months of this year, the U.S. government has recorded more deaths after COVID vaccinations than from all other vaccines administered in the United States between mid-1997 and the end of 2013. Thatâ€™s a period of fifteen and a half years. Again, more people, according to VAERS, have died after getting the shot in four months during a single vaccination campaign than from all other vaccines combined over more than a decade and a half. Chart that out. Itâ€™s a stunning picture. Now, the debate is over what it means. Again, thereâ€™s a lot of criticism of the reporting system. Some people say \"well, itâ€™s just a coincidence that someone gets the shot and then dies, possibly from other causes.\" No one really knows, is the truth. We spoke to one physician today who actively treats COVID patients. He described what weâ€™re seeing now as the single deadliest mass-vaccination event in modern history. Whatever is causing it, it is happening as we speak. So youâ€™d think someone in authority might want to know whatâ€™s going on.Â Â  If the vaccine injury reporting system is flawed â€” and it clearly is flawed â€” why hasnâ€™t it been fixed? And more to the point, why has there not been an independent vaccine safety board to assess whatâ€™s happening. And reassure people who stumble across official government numbers on the internet. But amazingly, none of that has been done. No one even mentions the numbers. And in fact, youâ€™re not allowed to. Youâ€™ll be pulled off the internet if you do. The people in charge do not acknowledge them. Instead, they warn us about what might happen if we donâ€™t take the vaccine. Like Joe Biden.Â  \"People who are not fully vaccinated can still die every day from COVID -19,\" Biden said. As a factual matter, that is true. But itâ€™s also misleading. Not all Americans are at  similar risk of dying from COVID-19. Some are at relatively high risk: the old and the sick. They might want to get vaccinated, and most do. Some are at very low risk of dying: the young and the healthy. Others appear to be at essentially no risk at all: anyone whoâ€™s had COVID and recovered. Virtually all of those people are immune. Thatâ€™s true for many viruses. Those second two categories â€” the young and healthy, and the previously infected â€” may add up to hundreds of millions of people in this country. The funny thing is, the White House â€“ the official policy-makers who are designing the vaccine rollout â€“ do not acknowledge that those categories even exist. Â  Health Authorities are pretending that everyoneâ€™s health and risk potential is exactly the same as everyone elseâ€™s. Thatâ€™s why Joe Biden has demanded that 70 percent of all American adults â€” regardless of age, regardless of health condition, regardless of pre-existing antibodies â€” get the COVID shot by the Fourth of July two months from now, or else. This might be an acceptable policy â€“ it would never be an ethical policy â€“ but it might be acceptable to the country if COVID vaccines we could show conclusively came with no risk, and if we truly understood the long-term effects of those vaccines. But neither one of those things is true. We know that according to the government reporting system, thousands of people have died after getting the shot. That is true in this country, where itâ€™s hotly debated when itâ€™s talked about at all, but itâ€™s also true in European countries, whose record-keeping is, if anything, more reliable than ours. Many thousands of other people appear to have been injured after getting the vaccine. VAERS records nearly 900 non-fatal heart attacks in people who just received the shot. 2,700 people reported unexplained chest pain. In all, the vaccine, according to the government reporting system, appears to have contributed to at least 8,000 hospitalizations.Â  Some of the side effects defy explanation. Researcher Alex Berenson has noted that coronavirus vaccines now account for almost one-third of all tinnitus reports in the VAERS database. Thatâ€™s the ringing in your ears. The American Tinnitus Association says it's received \"many questions\" on the link. Researchers at Oxford and UCLA have begun tracking coronavirus vaccine side effects across eight separate countries. They found, that \"Women aged 18 to 34 years had a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis than men of the same age.\" They also found that heart attacks were \"common\" in people aged 85 and older who had taken the vaccine. They found serious potential side effects in some children, \"anaphylaxis [and] appendicitis were more common in young people.\"Â  Vaccines are complicated medicines, and as with any drug, it can take a long time to get it precisely right. The dosage, for example. And this is not the first time people have been hurt during a vaccination campaign. That is bound to happen. Whatâ€™s different this time, and so striking, is the reaction to these numbers. Hereâ€™s a contrast for you: in 1976, the U.S. government vaccinated 45 million people with a vaccine for the swine flu. Fifty-three people reportedly died after getting that shot. The U.S. government immediately halted the vaccination program. Authorities decided it was too risky, it wasnâ€™t worth it.Â  Contrast that with what is happening now. This time, our health authorities have reserved their energy for anyone who dares to question vaccines. Â  LifeSiteNews, a nonprofit news organization, just found itself permanently banned from Facebook. Why? Because it reported government numbers from the VAERS database. Â  Famously, when podcaster Joe Rogan asked whether healthy young people ought to get the COVID vaccine, the media treated him like a criminal:Â  Anti-vaccine narratives. He did nothing of the sort. Almost everything they said was a lie that obscured a very simple and potentially relevant question that he asked, which is: should healthy young people receive the vaccine? Weâ€™re not precisely sure what the risks are. It is a lie to say there are no risks. There are risks in everything, including in getting a vaccine. So why not rationally weigh the risk/reward ratio, as we do with every decision we make. For that, he was denounced as an anti-vaxxer kook. A danger to public safety. Yahoo News published a piece entitled, \"Joe Rogan, who's not a doctor, gives terrible vaccine advice.\" That's the same Yahoo News that published this piece: Â \"5 things Bill Gates wants you to know about COVID-19 variants.\"Â  One of the very few elected officials in the country who has said a word about any of this, who has asked the obvious questions, not attacking vaccines, wondering about their effects, is Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Last week, Johnson asked Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, why so many Americans seem to be dying after the shot. Maybe thereâ€™s a good answer for that, Collins wouldnâ€™t even acknowledge that was happening. Instead, Collins fretted that if the population focused too much on the potential harm from vaccines, people might be hesitant to get them.Â Â  \"I challenged his use of the term â€˜Vaccine Hesitancy,â€™\" Ron Johnson told us in a conversation today. \"I told him that based on the VAERS deaths, and my conversations with people who have chosen not to get vaccinated, a better description would be: â€˜People who are hesitant to be coerced into participating in the largest drug trial in history.â€™\" Â  Exactly. Thereâ€™s a reason many states have more vaccine doses than they can use. Some people just donâ€™t want the vaccine. Thatâ€™s their right. Period. Not all of them are crazy. Health decisions used to be considered personal choices. We didnâ€™t ask about them. They were considered personal as recently as last fall. In September of 2020, at the height of the presidential campaign, a CNN reporter asked Kamala Harris whether she'd be willing to take the coronavirus vaccine once it became available. Â  \"Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us,\" Harris responded. \"I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump.\" A month later, at the vice presidential debate, Harris was if anything more emphatic on the subject. \"If Donald Trump tells us we should take\" the vaccine, she declared, \"I'm not going to take it.\"Â  Kamala Harris has, of course, since changed her mind. Sheâ€™s no longer skeptical of the vaccine, nor does she tolerate the skepticism of others. Instead, sheâ€™s an enthusiastic participant in COVID theater. Â And thatâ€™s really the only name for it. Just today, Harris and her husband made a point of kissing each other in front of photographers while wearing masks. They did this despite the fact theyâ€™re married, that they live together, that they were standing outside at the time and despite the fact that they both have been vaccinated. Â  A number of crude jokes come to mind, but for once weâ€™ll pass. It is the crudest kind of propaganda, designed by the cynical for the benefit of a population they consider stupid and weak and malleable. Itâ€™s not just Kamala Harris. Everyone is in on it, even the corporate comedians.Â  Comic buffoons even do what we assume is an unpaid ad for Moderna. It doesnâ€™t make you laugh. It makes you nervous. Why are they talking to you that way? Why are they giving you the finger on TV? No matter how many fingers they give you, it doesnâ€™t change what remains true for the country: If American citizens are going to be forced to take this vaccine or any other medicine, they have an absolute right to know what the effects of it might be. And they have an absolute right to ask that question. Without being silenced or censored or mocked or given the finger. No amount of happy talk or coercion or appeals to false patriotism can change that. Â Period. Â  \n","        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Not Americans whoâ€™ve been killed by the virus, thatâ€™s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the   designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. Weâ€™ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.Â  But what about the potential risks? Youâ€™d think you would know more about that than you do. We talk about vaccines constantly, not just on this show, but in this country.   was on TV yesterday talking about vaccines. He wants you to get one. Everyone in authority wants you to get one. In fact, youâ€™ve probably already had your shot, and good for you. If you havenâ€™t had your shot, youâ€™re under enormous pressure to get your shot. You understand that soon you may not be able to fly on commercial airplanes or go to work at the office or send your children to school if you donâ€™t have the shot. Meanwhile, the social pressure is enormous. Friends may have already informed you that youâ€™re not welcome at their parties or weddings if you havenâ€™t been vaccinated. There is a lot of pressure to comply. At some point, you probably will comply. Itâ€™s just too difficult not be to vaccinated in this country. Â Â  But before you make the appointment: do you know anything about the potential risks? Probably you donâ€™t know much. We all assume the risks are negligible. Vaccines arenâ€™t dangerous. Thatâ€™s not a guess, we know that pretty conclusively from the official numbers. Every flu season, we give influenza shots to more than 160 million Americans. Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.Â  Every death is tragic, but big picture, we donâ€™t consider those numbers disqualifying. We keep giving flu shots, and very few people complain about it. So the question is how do those numbers compare to the death rate from the coronavirus vaccines now being distributed across the country? Thatâ€™s worth knowing.Â  We checked today. Hereâ€™s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two â€” thatâ€™s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We donâ€™t have numbers past that, weâ€™re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that â€” perhaps vastly higher. Â  The data we just cited come from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System â€” VAERS â€” which is managed by the   and the FDA. VARES has received a lot of criticism over the years, some of it founded. Some critics have argued for a long time that VARES undercounts vaccine injuries. A report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2010 concluded that \"fewer than one percent of vaccine adverse events are reported\" by the VARES system. Fewer than one percent. So what is the real number of people who apparently have been killed or injured by the vaccine? Well, we donâ€™t know that number. Nobody does, and weâ€™re not going to speculate about it. But itâ€™s clear that what is happening now, for whatever reason, is not even close to normal. Itâ€™s not even close to what weâ€™ve seen in previous years with previous vaccines. Most vaccines are not accused of killing large numbers of people. The Menveo vaccine, for example, is given to people around the world, often children, to prevent bacterial meningitis. In this country, only one person died from that vaccine in the entire period between 2010 and 2015. One. So, compare that to whatâ€™s happening now. In just the first four months of this year, the U.S. government has recorded more deaths after COVID vaccinations than from all other vaccines administered in the United States between mid-1997 and the end of 2013. Thatâ€™s a period of fifteen and a half years. Again, more people, according to VAERS, have died after getting the shot in four months during a single vaccination campaign than from all other vaccines combined over more than a decade and a half. Chart that out. Itâ€™s a stunning picture. Now, the debate is over what it means. Again, thereâ€™s a lot of criticism of the reporting system. Some people say \"well, itâ€™s just a coincidence that someone gets the shot and then dies, possibly from other causes.\" No one really knows, is the truth. We spoke to one physician today who actively treats COVID patients. He described what weâ€™re seeing now as the single deadliest mass-vaccination event in modern history. Whatever is causing it, it is happening as we speak. So youâ€™d think someone in authority might want to know whatâ€™s going on.Â Â  If the vaccine injury reporting system is flawed â€” and it clearly is flawed â€” why hasnâ€™t it been fixed? And more to the point, why has there not been an independent vaccine safety board to assess whatâ€™s happening. And reassure people who stumble across official government numbers on the internet. But amazingly, none of that has been done. No one even mentions the numbers. And in fact, youâ€™re not allowed to. Youâ€™ll be pulled off the internet if you do. The people in charge do not acknowledge them. Instead, they warn us about what might happen if we donâ€™t take the vaccine. Like Joe Biden.Â  \"People who are not fully vaccinated can still die every day from COVID -19,\" Biden said. As a factual matter, that is true. But itâ€™s also misleading. Not all Americans are at  similar risk of dying from COVID-19. Some are at relatively high risk: the old and the sick. They might want to get vaccinated, and most do. Some are at very low risk of dying: the young and the healthy. Others appear to be at essentially no risk at all: anyone whoâ€™s had COVID and recovered. Virtually all of those people are immune. Thatâ€™s true for many viruses. Those second two categories â€” the young and healthy, and the previously infected â€” may add up to hundreds of millions of people in this country. The funny thing is, the White House â€“ the official policy-makers who are designing the vaccine rollout â€“ do not acknowledge that those categories even exist. Â  Health Authorities are pretending that everyoneâ€™s health and risk potential is exactly the same as everyone elseâ€™s.

And they listened, and read books, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And they listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently. And the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal. And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.

Iâ€™ve been following the responses to Kittyâ€™s Spirit led offering of hope, In the Time of Pandemic,  that seems to be circling the globe.  There has been much discussion about authenticity and historic confusion about writers with the same name.  I think if you look back through the thread of responses you will find answers to any concerns about authorship.  I donâ€™t know Kitty,  but her work and her comments to her readers show me the blessings of Spirit coming through loud and clear.  Light and love to all in these challenging days. Thank you, Janet. And yes, light and love to all of us human beings being human. ðŸ™‚ Lorraine, I have done this, many times and in many places this past week. I would encourage you, rather than visiting my site with further accusations, to actually source and read the other poem, and, if you are familiar with poetry, youâ€™ll see they are not at all alike. An important part of healing is to do the work for ourselves. This is my poem, and my site, and I wonâ€™t allow toxic energy to harm the sweet and kind people who visit with me here. All are invited, but kindness has to prevail. Why anyone would assume things about me without knowing me, or do that to anyone else, seems to speak to a need better directed and met inward before sharing it. I wish you peace, and that you be safe and well in this time of illness. You, Loraine, should put forward the â€œitalian quoteâ€.. better yet, should have checked carefully and understand an eventual inspiration from a plagiarism. Hi Kitty, My mother is recovering rapidly and has a pretty good prognosis! We have so much to feel grateful forâ€¦ I am working diligently on the piece I mentioned! it is rapidly turning into a book about evolutionary human ecology. I have been writing pieces of it (actually in the context of separate book projects) for about 5 years, and I just didnâ€™t know it! I do have a draft outline finished if youâ€™d like to see it, let me know. Steadily organizing the content I have written into the outline formatâ€¦ Hope you are doing OK and getting good self-care and space amidst this piece blowing up! I saw that you had to file a DMCA claim.  â€œBut, yes, now is the acceptable time to face the world and love her back into health and sustainability. I hope we donâ€™t squander it.â€ Yes, this a thousand times this! Thank you! cheers \n","ethan Oh, Ethan, such wonderful news regarding your mother! Please know I hold her continued healing in my heart. And how glorious for your own work in the world that youâ€™ve made progress and perceived connections that are allowing you to cohere years of work! I canâ€™t wait to see it, whenever you are ready to share. It sounds like a work we need (probably 30 years ago) rather desperately in these times. I hope you are finding joy in the important creating youâ€™re doing. Hooray for you!!! Yes, there has also been a learning curve for me in all of this, not all of it joyful, but, in fairness, overwhelmingly so, and I am still/always most grateful for the many, many connections that have been made between my words and the loveliest people in our worldâ€¦and there are millions. Please keep in touch when you are able, Ethan. Stay well and safe, and great gentle peace. These words are so beautiful. Iâ€™ve seen it shared over and over these past days on social media. Thankfully, so far always with your name attached. Being a writer and a former reporter, I just had to find the author! Do you have any other social media accounts? Iâ€™d love to be able to direct people to you in sharing it. Thank you again and be well! Thank you, Geeta; your words are so very kind. Youâ€™ll probably laugh, but I have this blog for sharing my writing, and my Facebook account that I keep private. I still need someone to spend a few minutes with me and help me learn to navigate Twitter and Instagram, but to be honest, I like to keep most of my time for my husband and 4-leggeds, reading, and long walks. I donâ€™t feel comfortable always being connected  to â€œmedia,â€ and losing connection with my spirit and thoughts. Bless you, and be well and safe. So true and so wise of you. I am so grateful and feel so blessed to have been allowed to share your profound thoughts. They bring me immense comfort at this time of immense stress. Thank you and bless you Kitty. Thatâ€™s wonderful to hear, Nancy. Please take care of yourself and weâ€™ll breathe through this together! Be well, and gentle peace. I agreeâ€¦ Words can hurt and they can heal.. It is heart warming to read your words \n","Patti Thank you, Patti; thatâ€™s so kind of you and lovely to hear. I hope youâ€™re well and safe. These days can be long and challenging.

I truly hope that what many healers and thought leaders in the world and what many of us are saying, that this is the great shift weâ€™ve been waiting and hoping for is true.

I am doing everything possible to correct the writer and I share the link to this page. It seems to me right that a beautiful thing should be given the right attribution.

Even way over here in Australia we have now discovered and love you. Thank you so much for crystallising hope in this overwhelming time  â€“ we had not had a chance to draw breath after our awful summer of deadly bushfires  and now this is upon us. Your clear voice is most welcome  and  I will take the liberty of sharing even further on FaceBook.  Goodonya! Wow, Teresa, youâ€™re so right about all the sorrows heaped on your beautiful home over these many months. Such tragic losses. I so hope this time of relative stillness (for many of us) allows us to truly see what weâ€™ve done to the earth and to be aware that sheâ€™s in triage, too. This is such an opportunity for healing. You take care! Thank you for your kind words and be well, Teresa. Kitty you are known throughout the World now and will be quoted for ever. Your words give me personally such hope for the future of our World and humankind. I am so glad you feel hopeful; keep it growing. Thank you, and be well! Your words have gone viral, literally overnight. The first time I read them, they made my heart pound! I thought I was the only one who felt, strangely, somewhat comforted and content staying home during this time of uncertainty. \n","Thank you for your beautiful words. You know, Valerie, I saw the maps that showed such great reduction in the pollution over China, and then the clearing moved over Europe; I hope itâ€™s happening here in my country, tooâ€¦and I thought what good could come from a time of such suffering. Then, the Spirit knocked me upside the head and I cobbled out the poem and it kind of spun out of my controlâ€¦another opportunity for self-awareness! I am so blessedly happy the small words have touched hearts and soothed. Gentle peace to you, and be well. Wonderful words.   Everyone needs to know the author You have a kind heart, Linda, but if everyone knows the words and feels them in their heart, thatâ€™s what matters. My love for the earth is my passion, and if we can allow her to heal and change how we live with her, it would be the best gift we ever gave ourselves. Wonderful words.   Everyone needs to know the author Or, just the person within and those beside her. ðŸ™‚ You are so kind to take time to write. I pray for your health and gentle peace. Thank you for these words.

Youâ€™d laugh to hear how often I talk to you in my head. ðŸ˜˜ Good afternoon Ms. Kitty. I am an admirer of this beautiful verse that you wrote and posted on your blog today but did you know that it has been exploding all over Facebook today? People are wondering where the verse came from and who the author is. Just to let people know, you may want to release a statement about the source of the verse to give yourself credit. There are many misleading things going around on social media right now so knowing the true source of your words would be reassuring to many Iâ€™m sure. Thank you for such uplifting words! Yes, encountered some craziness on Deepak Chopraâ€™s site, and I really just want to let it go. I wrote it and posted it on my little, personal Facebook page last Friday, and off it went: out of my control. I am so glad it touched your heart. Thank you for taking time to write me. Thank you so much for this! I posted on my FB page and have been searching for the author since. I have now posted a link to your blog. Your words have touched so many hearts, mine included. Thank you. Thank you! How kind of you. Please be safe during this troubling time, and gentle peace. I echo what Sheryl Pedersen said! There is a clamor from the folk looking for the origin of these lovely words. Thanks! Thank you, Kathy. Didnâ€™t expect that. The spirit was definitely speaking through me. Thank you for writing and take care. The passage is being attributed to Kitty Oâ€™Meara.  Is that you?  If so, there was apparently another Kitty Oâ€™Meara from the 1800â€™s that people are assuming wrote it Yes, it is mine. Iâ€™m not from the 1800â€™s. I was struck by the way pollution was clearing over China, then Europe as quarantine set in, and I thought we could all  both use this time for healing and heal the earth together. My work as a writer, spiritual director and chaplain influences my writing. Thank you for these wise and calming words â¤ï¸ Thank you, and take care of yourself and loved ones! Thank you for this, Kitty. Itâ€™s a beautiful piece and I, too, would like to see you credited. I have a young South African friend who was isolated in Haikou for about 2 months (Dec/Feb). When I asked her how she was coping, she said that she actually enjoyed having the time to be creativeâ€¦she wrote poetry, did yoga, danced, learned how to play the drums, learned how to do the dragon dance (with ribbons), experimented with cooking vegan dishes. To her also, it was a gift. Thanks again. Oh, I love this! I was thinking about that todayâ€¦all the things that jobs and life and genuine responsibilities keep us from pursuing, and all the while we have these â€œif onlyâ€ dreams. What a wonderful thing if people responded like your friend. Thank you so much for visiting, and gentle peace. Thank you for your reply, Kitty. She also made a video:  What Joy!!!! My Girl is back, just when we need her!!! Sighs with relief!!!xxxxxxxxxxxx Also loved thisâ€¦And the people began to think differentlyâ€¦this virus will change everything,â€¦the effect on climate change has already been seen.xxx Oh, my dear. I felt useless, not being in healthcare anymore, and thought maybe writing a few words would be something I could do. Now, to figure out how to post photos again. Iâ€™m a techno loser. ðŸ˜œ Love you and hold your wellness and that of your beautiful all-ness in my heart. Just keep writingâ€¦thatâ€™s a gift you have, Go Girlâ€¦.Love and hugs to all, xxxxxxxxx You, too! hi kitty! \n","just thought you would like to know that people are sharing your beautiful words. \n","this quote has been shared on all sorts of social media, i found it on instagram and was very touched ðŸ™‚ Isnâ€™t that something?! The spirit is certainly in control; as you can see, Iâ€™ve been writing forever and am not gifted or wise enough to publicize my writing that well! Ha!  Thank you for visiting and take good care of yourself and loved ones. Beautifully written. This is the world I hope to live in. There is so much potential for us all during difficult times, I hope everyone can become better in many ways. Thank you! I agree, with all our weaknesses, of course, but with sooooo much potential and creativity! I hope that happens, Mike. Some of us are blessed to have this gift of time to reflect and change, and we will witness so much sufferingin the process. It has to leave us changed, and why not in ways that are blessing? Take good care and gentle peace. I am always amazed how things appear just when you desperately need them. Thank you, Kitty. There is, I think, a spirit of love that guides and protects us, not magically, or in a way that spares us suffering, but by traveling with and beside us, so when weâ€™re really seeking, we find what we need. Gentle peace, Selena. Be well. Beautiful words indeed, they came at the right time. I am Lulu from South Africa, an academic reading beautiful words indeed expands my thought but is nice to read something that detox. Right now with the pandemic I feel to move away from news but very hard to do so. I got the tips from your text. Thank you very much for saving my brain. I was about to blowny skull. You take care of yourself, dear one. Your skull is precious; keep it intact. ðŸ™‚ These are very challenging times and we can connect in these wonderful ways to offer support and concern and genuine love. Do try to take time for your sweet spirit to relax and gain strength, away from all the chaos, when possible. Thank you for sharing kind words. Hi, Kitty. It took some time to find you, and Iâ€™m glad I did. On behalf of the many â€“ now possibly millions â€“ of people this particular entry has touched, thank you. It is a perfect salve. The muse was definitely with you on this day. Iâ€™m looking forward to reading more. Be well! It was the muse, the Spirit, thatâ€™s for sure. I tossed it off and posted it to my small group of Facebook friends, and 3 days later, Deepak Chopra was reading itâ€¦there you go: invitations everywhere. Iâ€™m glad so many were touched and felt comforted, which is all that matters. Take good care and be well, Bob! this is so so beautiful I hope itâ€™s ok to share and credit you of course. It will help a lot of people. For me it was such a poetic and soothing balm.. Thank you for kind words; it means soooo much to me that the words I shared were comforting to others. The Spirit moves in lovely ways, and thatâ€™s what we need to stay open to, more than ever. Take great care, Colette, and be well. Oh,Kitty!  SO glad to see your post in my box. Blessings and THANKFUL that you are sharing your precious perspective. Love you; be well and safe. Refreshing words. We need this quiet time to heal our reckless, fast paced lives. Weâ€™re certainly being invited to slow down, arenâ€™t we? Many seeds to be planted and great patience as we tend them. Thank you for taking time to share, and know how you have touched me by doing so. Take great care and be well! Greetings from across the ocean â€“ Thank you for your inspiring, positive and peaceful message, coming at a time when we really need it, everywhere on this troubled planet. Stay safe! It is, in many ways, a grand time to be alive in the sense that we are witnessing the heights and depths of what it means to be human, and I feel challenged to evolve while I have the time. Gentle peace and be well! As one staying home, Iâ€™m also watching the news and watching developments via the internet. Good to see so much evidence of peopleâ€™s Higher Selves in evidence! Good too to see it recognized and built upon by proposing a general higher awareness to follow! Many opportunities, arenâ€™t there? Gentle peace and be well! Where is the beautiful illustration from?  I would love a print of that! Thank you. All the photographs are mine. Writing and photography are my passions. Thank you for this, Iâ€™m glad I â€˜stumbleâ€™ on it on Instagram and to have found the origin. Your blog is lovely, I see you hadnâ€™t written for sometime, I encourage you take it up again, you have a gift to share, you and your muse obviously have touched many people. This piece has the quality of a fable, a biblical story, and hopefully, if enough people read it, as an affirmation of possibilities. I would like to share it on my blog, I absolutely give credit to authorship. Peace, Health and Blessings to you and your loved ones. â¤ Youâ€™re right, PJ. I was feeling so frustrated and blue that my friends in healthcare are struggling so desparately, and Iâ€™m now at home, seemingly doing nothing to help anyone. My husband told me to start writing. Itâ€™s funny, when you have a gift, even a small one, it comes naturally and you donâ€™t often see that itâ€™s truly a gift (and gifts are for giving away), so I wrote this and posted it on my small and personal facebook page, and one friend shared itâ€¦Lesson learned, again: Name and know and use your gifts. We all have them and theyâ€™re all necessary to heal ourselves and the earth be well. Gentle peace.. Bless you, PJ, and gentle peace. I love your writing, your insights. Please write more- and, selfishly i want to be a regular reader of your thoughts. Please make me a recipient of your blog. \n","Great thanks. Thank you, Deborah! This blog goes back quite a few years; thereâ€™s probably a lot more to read than youâ€™d like! But Iâ€™m sure happy you enjoy it and have joined its readers. Please take care and be well. Thank you for these inspiring and healing words. They echoed deeply in me, as with so many others. They give a voice to what we know is so urgently needed, but felt powerless to do, caught in the devouring relentless mechanic of our lives. Slow down, stop, become more conscious, healâ€¦ We have know for some time that we have to do it but be believed it was impossible. And here we are. \n","So a heartfelt gratitude for your words. I am discovering your blog but already I feel you have a beautiful heart.  One thought came to my mindâ€¦ Perhaps could I translate this message into French? (Iâ€™m actually French, was born there from American mother and French father) \n","I donâ€™t have many followers at all, but I could then share it with my family and friends there. Happy to give you credit and share your blog of course! Thank you, Thomas; itâ€™s OK, but yes, I do appreciate credit for my work. And could you give me your blog address? Iâ€™d enjoy seeing your translation and to read what youâ€™re writing. Iâ€™m glad to hear youâ€™re focused on slowing down and trying to be attentiveâ€¦itâ€™s lifelong work, isnâ€™t it? Take care and be well. Joy to your spirit. Oh Iâ€™m sorry if I mislead you. I donâ€™t have a blog. I meant I donâ€™t many followers on Facebook or social media in general. In fact I donâ€™t use those that much. I just thought about sharing your words on the pandemic with relatives and friends. Giving you credit of course! As I already did on a FB page where I found the quoteâ€¦ I tracked down your name and gave a link to this blog. Thatâ€™s wonderful. I hope you are safe \n","text1 \n","text2 Living From the Spirit Level And the people stayed home. And they listened, and read books, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And they listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently. And the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal. And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed. Note Well:Â  Please donâ€™t write to me on this, or any other post, requesting to use this poem as a slogan, a theme song, or any other part of a commercial venture designed to sell things we donâ€™t need. I reserve all rights to the material for the time being. Using the poem to sell anything is also antithetical to its theme; I wrote it to inspire the creative artist and giver in all of us, not to prop up a corporate structure more intent on exploiting gift than enlarging it. Oh Goshâ€¦.What a wonderful moment to see the Daily Round in my email box againâ€¦! Wow, glad you are well and still with us. I hope all the four leggeds and hubby are well too.

Not sure when itâ€™s finished. Mom was just diagnosed with cancer amidst all this, sooooâ€¦.we are trying to ensure she gets care in a timely fashion before it metastasizes. Thank you for writing such a succinct vision and making it in the past tense, and clearly touching on the hopes of so many. We have so much work to do to get thereâ€¦we have no choice, though, do we? Oh, Ethan; first, I am so sorry your family is dealing with this new terror in the midst of a healthcare crisis. I worked with the best in that field and I know how hard they are trying to spread their gifts. You motherâ€™s care and healing are now carried in my heart, and please, if time allows, let me know how itâ€™s going for you all. Your essay sounds intriguing and hopeful; I would so enjoy reading it when you have completed it. Yes, please use the quote, if you like. We still have many choices, dear one. Writing that essay is one of them, and being the loving son who is choosing to accompany his mother on this journey is another. But, yes, now is the acceptable time to face the world and love her back into health and sustainability. I hope we donâ€™t squander it. Be well, gentle peace. Thank you so much. Yes, to everything you said.

While it reads as a fable, Iâ€™d rather it not be confused with a â€œfairy tale,â€ as I firmly believe change is not only possible but utterly necessary for our welfare and survival, and I think many people hear the words, â€œfairy taleâ€ and immediately use the words to disassociate from a reality connected to their own. I realize Jung understood the truth and value of myths, symbol, and fairy tales, but Iâ€™d rather not have my poem pulled into that context before people have a chance to hear the invitations and act on them.

Iâ€™ve been following the responses to Kittyâ€™s Spirit led offering of hope, In the Time of Pandemic,  that seems to be circling the globe.  There has been much discussion about authenticity and historic confusion about writers with the same name.  I think if you look back through the thread of responses you will find answers to any concerns about authorship.  I donâ€™t know Kitty,  but her work and her comments to her readers show me the blessings of Spirit coming through loud and clear.  Light and love to all in these challenging days. Thank you, Janet. And yes, light and love to all of us human beings being human. ðŸ™‚ Lorraine, I have done this, many times and in many places this past week. I would encourage you, rather than visiting my site with further accusations, to actually source and read the other poem, and, if you are familiar with poetry, youâ€™ll see they are not at all alike. An important part of healing is to do the work for ourselves. This is my poem, and my site, and I wonâ€™t allow toxic energy to harm the sweet and kind people who visit with me here. All are invited, but kindness has to prevail. Why anyone would assume things about me without knowing me, or do that to anyone else, seems to speak to a need better directed and met inward before sharing it. I wish you peace, and that you be safe and well in this time of illness. You, Loraine, should put forward the â€œitalian quoteâ€.. better yet, should have checked carefully and understand an eventual inspiration from a plagiarism. Hi Kitty, My mother is recovering rapidly and has a pretty good prognosis! We have so much to feel grateful forâ€¦ I am working diligently on the piece I mentioned! it is rapidly turning into a book about evolutionary human ecology. I have been writing pieces of it (actually in the context of separate book projects) for about 5 years, and I just didnâ€™t know it! I do have a draft outline finished if youâ€™d like to see it, let me know. Steadily organizing the content I have written into the outline formatâ€¦ Hope you are doing OK and getting good self-care and space amidst this piece blowing up! I saw that you had to file a DMCA claim.  â€œBut, yes, now is the acceptable time to face the world and love her back into health and sustainability. I hope we donâ€™t squander it.â€ Yes, this a thousand times this! Thank you! cheers \n","ethan Oh, Ethan, such wonderful news regarding your mother! Please know I hold her continued healing in my heart. And how glorious for your own work in the world that youâ€™ve made progress and perceived connections that are allowing you to cohere years of work! I canâ€™t wait to see it, whenever you are ready to share. It sounds like a work we need (probably 30 years ago) rather desperately in these times. I hope you are finding joy in the important creating youâ€™re doing. Hooray for you!!! Yes, there has also been a learning curve for me in all of this, not all of it joyful, but, in fairness, overwhelmingly so, and I am still/always most grateful for the many, many connections that have been made between my words and the loveliest people in our worldâ€¦and there are millions. Please keep in touch when you are able, Ethan. Stay well and safe, and great gentle peace. These words are so beautiful. Iâ€™ve seen it shared over and over these past days on social media. Thankfully, so far always with your name attached. Being a writer and a former reporter, I just had to find the author! Do you have any other social media accounts? Iâ€™d love to be able to direct people to you in sharing it. Thank you again and be well! Thank you, Geeta; your words are so very kind. Youâ€™ll probably laugh, but I have this blog for sharing my writing, and my Facebook account that I keep private. I still need someone to spend a few minutes with me and help me learn to navigate Twitter and Instagram, but to be honest, I like to keep most of my time for my husband and 4-leggeds, reading, and long walks. I donâ€™t feel comfortable always being connected  to â€œmedia,â€ and losing connection with my spirit and thoughts. Bless you, and be well and safe. So true and so wise of you. I am so grateful and feel so blessed to have been allowed to share your profound thoughts. They bring me immense comfort at this time of immense stress. Thank you and bless you Kitty. Thatâ€™s wonderful to hear, Nancy. Please take care of yourself and weâ€™ll breathe through this together! Be well, and gentle peace. I agreeâ€¦ Words can hurt and they can heal.. It is heart warming to read your words \n","Patti Thank you, Patti; thatâ€™s so kind of you and lovely to hear. I hope youâ€™re well and safe. These days can be long and challenging.

Even way over here in Australia we have now discovered and love you. Thank you so much for crystallising hope in this overwhelming time  â€“ we had not had a chance to draw breath after our awful summer of deadly bushfires  and now this is upon us. Your clear voice is most welcome  and  I will take the liberty of sharing even further on FaceBook.  Goodonya! Wow, Teresa, youâ€™re so right about all the sorrows heaped on your beautiful home over these many months. Such tragic losses. I so hope this time of relative stillness (for many of us) allows us to truly see what weâ€™ve done to the earth and to be aware that sheâ€™s in triage, too. This is such an opportunity for healing. You take care! Thank you for your kind words and be well, Teresa. Kitty you are known throughout the World now and will be quoted for ever. Your words give me personally such hope for the future of our World and humankind. I am so glad you feel hopeful; keep it growing. Thank you, and be well! Your words have gone viral, literally overnight. The first time I read them, they made my heart pound! I thought I was the only one who felt, strangely, somewhat comforted and content staying home during this time of uncertainty. \n","Thank you for your beautiful words. You know, Valerie, I saw the maps that showed such great reduction in the pollution over China, and then the clearing moved over Europe; I hope itâ€™s happening here in my country, tooâ€¦and I thought what good could come from a time of such suffering. Then, the Spirit knocked me upside the head and I cobbled out the poem and it kind of spun out of my controlâ€¦another opportunity for self-awareness! I am so blessedly happy the small words have touched hearts and soothed. Gentle peace to you, and be well. Wonderful words.   Everyone needs to know the author You have a kind heart, Linda, but if everyone knows the words and feels them in their heart, thatâ€™s what matters. My love for the earth is my passion, and if we can allow her to heal and change how we live with her, it would be the best gift we ever gave ourselves. Wonderful words.

Youâ€™d laugh to hear how often I talk to you in my head. ðŸ˜˜ Good afternoon Ms. Kitty. I am an admirer of this beautiful verse that you wrote and posted on your blog today but did you know that it has been exploding all over Facebook today? People are wondering where the verse came from and who the author is. Just to let people know, you may want to release a statement about the source of the verse to give yourself credit. There are many misleading things going around on social media right now so knowing the true source of your words would be reassuring to many Iâ€™m sure. Thank you for such uplifting words! Yes, encountered some craziness on Deepak Chopraâ€™s site, and I really just want to let it go. I wrote it and posted it on my little, personal Facebook page last Friday, and off it went: out of my control. I am so glad it touched your heart. Thank you for taking time to write me. Thank you so much for this! I posted on my FB page and have been searching for the author since. I have now posted a link to your blog. Your words have touched so many hearts, mine included. Thank you. Thank you! How kind of you. Please be safe during this troubling time, and gentle peace. I echo what Sheryl Pedersen said! There is a clamor from the folk looking for the origin of these lovely words. Thanks! Thank you, Kathy. Didnâ€™t expect that. The spirit was definitely speaking through me. Thank you for writing and take care. The passage is being attributed to Kitty Oâ€™Meara.  Is that you?  If so, there was apparently another Kitty Oâ€™Meara from the 1800â€™s that people are assuming wrote it Yes, it is mine. Iâ€™m not from the 1800â€™s. I was struck by the way pollution was clearing over China, then Europe as quarantine set in, and I thought we could all  both use this time for healing and heal the earth together. My work as a writer, spiritual director and chaplain influences my writing. Thank you for these wise and calming words â¤ï¸ Thank you, and take care of yourself and loved ones! Thank you for this, Kitty. Itâ€™s a beautiful piece and I, too, would like to see you credited. I have a young South African friend who was isolated in Haikou for about 2 months (Dec/Feb). When I asked her how she was coping, she said that she actually enjoyed having the time to be creativeâ€¦she wrote poetry, did yoga, danced, learned how to play the drums, learned how to do the dragon dance (with ribbons), experimented with cooking vegan dishes. To her also, it was a gift. Thanks again. Oh, I love this! I was thinking about that todayâ€¦all the things that jobs and life and genuine responsibilities keep us from pursuing, and all the while we have these â€œif onlyâ€ dreams. What a wonderful thing if people responded like your friend. Thank you so much for visiting, and gentle peace. Thank you for your reply, Kitty. She also made a video:  What Joy!!!! My Girl is back, just when we need her!!! Sighs with relief!!!xxxxxxxxxxxx Also loved thisâ€¦And the people began to think differentlyâ€¦this virus will change everything,â€¦the effect on climate change has already been seen.xxx Oh, my dear. I felt useless, not being in healthcare anymore, and thought maybe writing a few words would be something I could do. Now, to figure out how to post photos again. Iâ€™m a techno loser. ðŸ˜œ Love you and hold your wellness and that of your beautiful all-ness in my heart. Just keep writingâ€¦thatâ€™s a gift you have, Go Girlâ€¦.Love and hugs to all, xxxxxxxxx You, too! hi kitty! \n","just thought you would like to know that people are sharing your beautiful words. \n","this quote has been shared on all sorts of social media, i found it on instagram and was very touched ðŸ™‚ Isnâ€™t that something?! The spirit is certainly in control; as you can see, Iâ€™ve been writing forever and am not gifted or wise enough to publicize my writing that well! Ha!  Thank you for visiting and take good care of yourself and loved ones. Beautifully written. This is the world I hope to live in. There is so much potential for us all during difficult times, I hope everyone can become better in many ways. Thank you! I agree, with all our weaknesses, of course, but with sooooo much potential and creativity! I hope that happens, Mike. Some of us are blessed to have this gift of time to reflect and change, and we will witness so much sufferingin the process. It has to leave us changed, and why not in ways that are blessing? Take good care and gentle peace. I am always amazed how things appear just when you desperately need them. Thank you, Kitty. There is, I think, a spirit of love that guides and protects us, not magically, or in a way that spares us suffering, but by traveling with and beside us, so when weâ€™re really seeking, we find what we need. Gentle peace, Selena. Be well. Beautiful words indeed, they came at the right time. I am Lulu from South Africa, an academic reading beautiful words indeed expands my thought but is nice to read something that detox. Right now with the pandemic I feel to move away from news but very hard to do so. I got the tips from your text. Thank you very much for saving my brain. I was about to blowny skull. You take care of yourself, dear one. Your skull is precious; keep it intact. ðŸ™‚ These are very challenging times and we can connect in these wonderful ways to offer support and concern and genuine love. Do try to take time for your sweet spirit to relax and gain strength, away from all the chaos, when possible. Thank you for sharing kind words. Hi, Kitty. It took some time to find you, and Iâ€™m glad I did. On behalf of the many â€“ now possibly millions â€“ of people this particular entry has touched, thank you. It is a perfect salve. The muse was definitely with you on this day. Iâ€™m looking forward to reading more. Be well! It was the muse, the Spirit, thatâ€™s for sure. I tossed it off and posted it to my small group of Facebook friends, and 3 days later, Deepak Chopra was reading itâ€¦there you go: invitations everywhere. Iâ€™m glad so many were touched and felt comforted, which is all that matters. Take good care and be well, Bob! this is so so beautiful I hope itâ€™s ok to share and credit you of course. It will help a lot of people. For me it was such a poetic and soothing balm.. Thank you for kind words; it means soooo much to me that the words I shared were comforting to others. The Spirit moves in lovely ways, and thatâ€™s what we need to stay open to, more than ever. Take great care, Colette, and be well. Oh,Kitty!  SO glad to see your post in my box. Blessings and THANKFUL that you are sharing your precious perspective. Love you; be well and safe. Refreshing words. We need this quiet time to heal our reckless, fast paced lives. Weâ€™re certainly being invited to slow down, arenâ€™t we? Many seeds to be planted and great patience as we tend them. Thank you for taking time to share, and know how you have touched me by doing so. Take great care and be well! Greetings from across the ocean â€“ Thank you for your inspiring, positive and peaceful message, coming at a time when we really need it, everywhere on this troubled planet. Stay safe! It is, in many ways, a grand time to be alive in the sense that we are witnessing the heights and depths of what it means to be human, and I feel challenged to evolve while I have the time. Gentle peace and be well! As one staying home, Iâ€™m also watching the news and watching developments via the internet. Good to see so much evidence of peopleâ€™s Higher Selves in evidence! Good too to see it recognized and built upon by proposing a general higher awareness to follow! Many opportunities, arenâ€™t there? Gentle peace and be well! Where is the beautiful illustration from?  I would love a print of that! Thank you. All the photographs are mine. Writing and photography are my passions. Thank you for this, Iâ€™m glad I â€˜stumbleâ€™ on it on Instagram and to have found the origin. Your blog is lovely, I see you hadnâ€™t written for sometime, I encourage you take it up again, you have a gift to share, you and your muse obviously have touched many people. This piece has the quality of a fable, a biblical story, and hopefully, if enough people read it, as an affirmation of possibilities. I would like to share it on my blog, I absolutely give credit to authorship. Peace, Health and Blessings to you and your loved ones. â¤ Youâ€™re right, PJ. I was feeling so frustrated and blue that my friends in healthcare are struggling so desparately, and Iâ€™m now at home, seemingly doing nothing to help anyone. My husband told me to start writing. Itâ€™s funny, when you have a gift, even a small one, it comes naturally and you donâ€™t often see that itâ€™s truly a gift (and gifts are for giving away), so I wrote this and posted it on my small and personal facebook page, and one friend shared itâ€¦Lesson learned, again: Name and know and use your gifts. We all have them and theyâ€™re all necessary to heal ourselves and the earth be well. Gentle peace.. Bless you, PJ, and gentle peace. I love your writing, your insights. Please write more- and, selfishly i want to be a regular reader of your thoughts. Please make me a recipient of your blog. \n","Great thanks. Thank you, Deborah! This blog goes back quite a few years; thereâ€™s probably a lot more to read than youâ€™d like! But Iâ€™m sure happy you enjoy it and have joined its readers. Please take care and be well. Thank you for these inspiring and healing words. They echoed deeply in me, as with so many others. They give a voice to what we know is so urgently needed, but felt powerless to do, caught in the devouring relentless mechanic of our lives. Slow down, stop, become more conscious, healâ€¦ We have know for some time that we have to do it but be believed it was impossible. And here we are. \n","So a heartfelt gratitude for your words. I am discovering your blog but already I feel you have a beautiful heart.  One thought came to my mindâ€¦ Perhaps could I translate this message into French?

Happy to give you credit and share your blog of course! Thank you, Thomas; itâ€™s OK, but yes, I do appreciate credit for my work. And could you give me your blog address? Iâ€™d enjoy seeing your translation and to read what youâ€™re writing. Iâ€™m glad to hear youâ€™re focused on slowing down and trying to be attentiveâ€¦itâ€™s lifelong work, isnâ€™t it? Take care and be well. Joy to your spirit. Oh Iâ€™m sorry if I mislead you. I donâ€™t have a blog. I meant I donâ€™t many followers on Facebook or social media in general. In fact I donâ€™t use those that much. I just thought about sharing your words on the pandemic with relatives and friends. Giving you credit of course! As I already did on a FB page where I found the quoteâ€¦ I tracked down your name and gave a link to this blog. Thatâ€™s wonderful.

While   instituted lockdowns,   initially called for \"not taking as many draconian measures\" and said that he would not be closing schools or cancelling large events. Britainâ€™s chief scientific adviser   on March 13, \"Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely. Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease.\"Â  Immediately,    . Dr. William Hanage, an expert on epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard,   in an op-ed for The Guardian that he thought Britainâ€™s plan was \"satire.\" \"The U.K. should not be trying to create herd immunity, that will take care of itself,\" he wrote. \"Policy should be directed at slowing the outbreak to a (more) manageable rate.\" Medical experts in the U.K. told   that it wasnâ€™t actually the goal of U.K. officials to spread the coronavirus to lead to herd immunity, but that they botched public communication. The  didnâ€™t mention herd immunity at all.Â  \"People have misinterpreted the phrase herd immunity as meaning that weâ€™re going to have an epidemic to get people infected,\"   Graham Medley at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine The   following the March 16 release of a  by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team. Experts outlined two different strategies: mitigation, which aims to slow but not necessarily stop the epidemic, and suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth. The experts concluded that mitigation might reduce deaths, but would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelm intensive care units. Experts concluded that suppression is theÂ  \"only viable strategy at the current time. \" On March 16,   new measures including recommendations that everyone should work from home if possible and avoid crowded gatherings, including at  . Johnson said that those with underlying conditions and the elderly should stay at home. \"Herd immunity is not part of our action plan but is a natural by-product of an epidemic,\" said Alex Gore, a spokesman for the U.K.â€™s Department of Health and Social Care. \"Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence.\" Miami Herald reporter Martin Vassolo, , March 13, 2020 Miami Beach,   (minute 46), March 13, 2020 Sun Sentinel,  , March 15, 2020 Vox,  , March 15, 2020 Full Fact,  , March 10, 2020 The Atlantic,  , March 16, 2020 CNN, US,  , March 17, 2020 The Guardian,  , March 12, 2020 The Guardian opinion by Dr William Hanage is a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard,  March 15, 2020 The Conversation by Arindam Basu, Associate Professor, Epidemiology and Environmental Health, University of Canterbury,  , March 17, 2020 Science Media Centre,  , March 13, 2020 The Hill,  , March 16, 2020 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology,  Accessed March 17, 2020 Washington Post,  , March 16, 2020 The Independent,  , March 13, 2020 BBC,  , March 17, 2020 Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team,  , March 16, 2020 Metro,   March 17, 2020 Email interview, Miami Beach Commissioner Ricky Arriola, March 16, 2020 Email interview, Stephen S.

(Read more about .) The Waking Times blog post heavily quotes Bill Gatesâ€™  , specifically when he explains how RNA COVID-19 vaccines could be developed and how they would create antibodies.Â  RNA vaccines have been   to create \"a safe and long-lasting immune response in animal models and humans\"Â  in clinical and preclinical trials. However, licensed RNA vaccines have never been produced before.Â  The body creates proteins by translating mRNA, the messenger molecules from DNA. By introducing a new mRNA vaccine to a few cells in the human body, those   will produce the proteins of \"a disease-specific antigen,\" and the immune system can create an antigen-specific antibody. Basically, it creates only the parts of a pathogen that the body reacts to and creates antibodies to bond to. This way, the body can easily attack the disease when it recognizes its cells. The second half of this claim, that these vaccines would \"permanently alter your DNA\" is incorrect. An   in Frontiers on Immunology analyzed new studies that found mRNA \"cannot potentially integrate into the host genome and will be degraded naturally.\" Basically, after the messenger molecules create antigens for the body to react to, they will naturally stop being used and break down. The Waking Times blog shared on Facebook asserts that a new COVID-19 RNA vaccine \"will not be tested in any significant or standard capacity\" and that readers should prepare to be \"guinea pigs in the largest global health experiment ever.\" But Gates makes it very clear throughout his own blog post that scientists are not just relying on RNA or DNA experiments to create the first worldwide COVID-19 vaccine. \"As of April 9, there are 115 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline,\" Gates writes. RNA and DNA vaccines are easier to produce and they are testing them right now, but \"even if an RNA vaccine continues to show promise, we still must continue pursuing the other options.\" Contrary to the explosive claim that the entire world would be treated as \"guinea pigs\" for a new RNA or DNA vaccine, Gates explains how any COVID-19 vaccine will go through a rigorous, but also shortened, testing period. The New England Journal of Medicine has   that they can shorten the usual 5-year period of vaccine testing to three short testing trials over 18 months. Gates says later in his article that itâ€™s a priority to \"make sure we have good real-world evidence that the vaccine is completely safe to use.\" RNA testing will be done on small groups before it reaches the entire world. The first round of clinical   with an RNA vaccine for COVID-19 began on May 16th. The dosage test has only 105 subjects and is projected to take at least a year to complete. A blog post shared on social media reads \"Bill Gates Explains That The COVID Vaccine Will Use Experimental Technology And Permanently Alter Your DNA.\" This is inaccurate. Gates never said that the first licensed COVID-19 vaccine would use experimental technology or permanently alter DNA;Â he said specifically that \"we donâ€™t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like.\" The most recent research also shows that RNA vaccines, which are being tested for COVID-19 right now, do degrade naturally and donâ€™t alter DNA permanently.

RNA and DNA vaccines are easier to produce and they are testing them right now, but \"even if an RNA vaccine continues to show promise, we still must continue pursuing the other options.\" Contrary to the explosive claim that the entire world would be treated as \"guinea pigs\" for a new RNA or DNA vaccine, Gates explains how any COVID-19 vaccine will go through a rigorous, but also shortened, testing period. The New England Journal of Medicine has   that they can shorten the usual 5-year period of vaccine testing to three short testing trials over 18 months. Gates says later in his article that itâ€™s a priority to \"make sure we have good real-world evidence that the vaccine is completely safe to use.\" RNA testing will be done on small groups before it reaches the entire world. The first round of clinical   with an RNA vaccine for COVID-19 began on May 16th. The dosage test has only 105 subjects and is projected to take at least a year to complete. A blog post shared on social media reads \"Bill Gates Explains That The COVID Vaccine Will Use Experimental Technology And Permanently Alter Your DNA.\" This is inaccurate. Gates never said that the first licensed COVID-19 vaccine would use experimental technology or permanently alter DNA;Â he said specifically that \"we donâ€™t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like.\" The most recent research also shows that RNA vaccines, which are being tested for COVID-19 right now, do degrade naturally and donâ€™t alter DNA permanently.

This lawmaker is wrong, everyone was lied to Based on these early studies, children of all ages are at risk for COVID-19; however, complications of COVID-19 appear to be less common among children compared with adults based on limited reports from China and the U.S. The good news is that medical consensus at this time, based on data, is that children generally have a mild form of COVID and that many are asymptomatic. Overall, if your child contracts COVID, they will be OK. That is good news. But to take that and say that kids are â€˜not at riskâ€™ is an oversimplification and untrue. Some children have died of COVID, some have been in ICUs. There absolutely are studies of COVID-19 risk in children. It is silly to say that kids do not have risk, an oversimplification and untrue.

The restrictions do not apply to Britain, he said. Mr. Trump imposed a 30-day ban on foreigners who have been in the 26 countries that make up the European Unionâ€™s Schengen Area in the previous two weeks. The limits take effect Friday at midnight and will exempt American citizens and permanent legal residents and their families, although they could be funneled to certain airports for enhanced screening. Later on Wednesday night,   telling Americans to â€œreconsider travelâ€ to all countries because of the global effects of the coronavirus. It is the departmentâ€™s second-strongest advisory, behind â€œdo not travel.â€  Speaking from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump also said health insurance companies had agreed to extend insurance coverage to cover coronavirus treatments as well as waive related co-payments. The president added that he planned to soon announce emergency action to provide financial relief for workers who fall ill or need to be quarantined. He said he would ask Congress to take legislative action to extend that relief but did not detail what that would be. He said he would instruct the Treasury Department to â€œdefer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted.â€ The president, sitting behind the Resolute Desk with his arms crossed, finally appeared to be acknowledging the severity of the virus, calling it a â€œhorrible infectionâ€ and acknowledging that Americans should cut back on travel that was not necessary.  It signaled a break from the business-as-usual attitude he had been trying to project as recently as Tuesday, when he urged Americans to â€œstay calmâ€ and said the virus would soon go away. But Mr. Trump continued to anticipate a fast end date to the spread of the coronavirus, even as medical experts have warned that the pandemic will worsen.  â€œThis is not a financial crisis,â€ he said. â€œThis is just a temporary moment in time that we will overcome as a nation and a world.â€ The address capped a day when concerns about the threat of the virus seemed to reach a new pitch and measures to protect vulnerable populations began to upend regular life across the country. Many schools announced they would close indefinitely, some nursing homes banned visitors, and workplaces across the country urged their employees to work from home.  after a Utah Jazz player was found to have tested positive for the coronavirus, the league announced on Wednesday. The league said the suspension would take effect after the completion of Wednesdayâ€™s schedule. In Oklahoma City, a game between the Thunder and the Jazz was seconds away from starting when the Thunderâ€™s head medical staffer sprinted onto the court to talk to referees. Players from both teams then left for their locker rooms. â€œThe N.B.A. will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,â€ the league said in its statement. Earlier Wednesday, the N.C.A.A. announced that its menâ€™s and womenâ€™s basketball tournaments â€” the grandest annual exhibition in U.S. college sports â€” will be    â€œWhile I understand how disappointing this is for all fans of our sports, my decision is based on the current understanding of how Covid-19 is progressing in the United States,â€ Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, said in a statement. The move will allow the games to go on for the benefit of television audiences, but in a dramatically different playing atmosphere that is certain to change the tenor of the tournaments. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy on Wednesday ordered almost all businesses nationwide to close as infections and deaths from the new coronavirus continued to soar, two days after he announced stringent travel restrictions.  Pharmacies, grocery stores, banks and public transit will be allowed to operate, but any other commercial enterprise that is not vital â€” restaurants, bars, most stores, cafes, beauty salons â€” must close to limit the contagion, Mr. Conte said in an evening address to the nation. Italy had already imposed controls unlike anything seen in a modern democracy, banning public gatherings and telling a nation of 60 million people to halt travel except for work or emergencies. But in Italy and across Europe, the epidemic has spread at a speed that has left countries scrambling to come up with containment plans. Mr. Conte did not say when the new order would go into effect, but many businesses had already closed, either based on their own judgments or in expectation of a government decree. â€œIf the numbers keep going up, which is not at all improbable,â€ Mr. Conte said, it would mean not that new measures were needed, but that Italians should stick to those already imposed. â€œWe must be lucid, measured, rigorous, responsible.â€ The benefits of Italyâ€™s sacrifice will not be seen for weeks, he warned. Italy reported more than 2,300 new cases on Wednesday, driving its total to more than 12,000, with 827 deaths â€” the second-worst outbreak in the world, after China. Italy has more than half the cases in Europe. Across Europe, the number of confirmed infections jumped by almost a quarter from Tuesday to Wednesday, reaching more than 22,000. The coronavirus outbreak ended one of the longest winning streaks in the financial marketsâ€™ history on Wednesday, as major stock indexes plunged and global policymakers grappled with the growing economic crisis.  The widely followed S&P 500 was off nearly 5 percent for the day, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 6 percent, putting it more than 20 percent below its peak in February â€” the threshold for a bear market.  The full economic toll of the outbreak will not be clear for months. But there is mounting evidence that it will be severe.  Airlines are warning of empty planes and huge financial losses. A sharp drop in oil prices is threatening to put energy companies out of business and thousands of American drillers out of work. Supply-chain bottlenecks are forcing factories around the world to cut output, even as a slump in consumer confidence is raising doubts that there will be demand for their goods once production resumes. Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic appeared unwilling or unable to mount an aggressive response to the crisis. A   by the Federal Reserve last week failed to calm financial markets. A   on Wednesday was equally ineffectual. Governments in Europe were struggling to manage their budgets even before the virus struck, limiting their ability to spend heavily to keep their economies afloat. The United States was on fairly firm economic footing before the virus hit, with low unemployment and strong consumer spending â€” but cracks were already showing. The trade war with China hurt manufacturers and farmers, leaving the economy even more dependent on consumer spending.  As recently as a week ago, few economists thought a recession was likely. Most thought that any damage from the virus would be brief, and that the economy would experience a sharp, â€œV-shapedâ€ recovery. Forecasts have become significantly gloomier, however, as the virus has spread in the United States and as the effects around the world have become more pronounced. Britainâ€™s government promised nearly $39 billion in stimulus to its economy on Wednesday, including about $6.5 billion for the countryâ€™s frayed National Health Service and other public bodies. The governmentâ€™s crisis committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss social distancing strategies for tackling the virus, which could mean more people working from home, school closures and restrictions on large-scale gatherings. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announced about $2.8 billion in spending to counter the economic fallout. Israel has imposed a mandatory 14-day isolation of anyone entering the country, abruptly choking off tourism. The Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks announced on Wednesday night that he and his wife, Rita Wilson,  . Mr. Hanks, 63, is one of the most famous celebrities to contract the virus that has spread throughout the globe. Mr. Hanks, who is in Australia to film a movie about the life of Elvis Presley, wrote that he and Ms. Wilson, also an actor, had gotten tested after feeling tired with body aches and feverish temperatures. The couple will remain isolated for as long as public health requires, Mr. Hanks wrote.  â€œNot much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?â€ Mr. Hanks wrote in the statement, which was accompanied by a photograph of a lone medical glove in a hazardous waste container. Hanks is playing the role of Colonel Tom Parker, Presleyâ€™s eccentric manager, who groomed the famous singer to stardom in the 1950s. Production on the film, which is being directed by Baz Luhrmann, is set to begin filming on Monday. Australia has had more than 120 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday. New York Cityâ€™s St. Patrickâ€™s Day Parade, the largest such celebration in the world, was postponed on Wednesday night over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. The announcement, made by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, follows the cancellation of St. Patrickâ€™s Day celebrations in Chicago and Boston. On Monday, Ireland canceled all parades nationwide. The parade, traditionally held on March 17, draws an estimated 150,000 marchers and two million spectators a year to Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, including many police and military groups, firefighters, Irish musicians and student groups from across the United States. It is one of the cityâ€™s largest recurring public events. The spread of the coronavirus across more than 100 countries  , World Health Organization officials said on Wednesday, confirming what many epidemiologists have been saying for weeks. Until now, the W.H.O. had avoided using the term, for fear that people would think the outbreak was unstoppable and countries would give up on trying to contain it.  â€œPandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,â€ Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, chief of the W.H.O., said at a news conference in Geneva. â€œWe cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough,â€ he added. â€œAll countries can still change the course of this pandemic.â€ There is evidence on six continents of sustained transmission of the virus, which has infected more than 120,000 people and killed more than 4,300. The pandemic designation is largely symbolic, but public health officials know that the public will hear in the word elements of danger and risk. According to the W.H.O., an epidemic   as a regional outbreak of an illness that spreads unexpectedly. In 2010, it   as â€œthe worldwide spread of a new diseaseâ€ that affects large numbers of people. The C.D.C. says it is â€œan epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.â€ The last pandemic declared by the W.H.O. was in 2009, for a new strain of H1N1 influenza. An aide working in the Washington office of Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington State, has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to a statement from her office, becoming the first confirmed case of the virus on Capitol Hill.  The aide, who was not identified, had been in isolation since beginning to show symptoms. The person had no known contact with the senator or any other members of Congress, according to the statement, and the senator asked for testing for any staff members who came into contact with the person and show symptoms of the virus.  Ms. Cantwell has also closed her Washington office for deep cleaning. Staff members will be working remotely.  There has been no indication that lawmakers, who are scheduled to vote on Thursday before leaving for a weeklong recess, will leave Washington earlier than planned. Democratic lawmakers are wrapping up an expansive legislative package to counter the outbreak and provide support for families affected by the virus. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said a ban on large events was imminent. Churches and college campuses shut their doors. New York Cityâ€™s St. Patrickâ€™s Day Parade, the largest such celebration in the world, was postponed. And in Washington State, where the virus has hit Americans hardest, Gov. Jay Inslee said on Wednesday that people should no longer sit shoulder-to-shoulder in local bars. In the era of the coronavirus, he said, such socializing has become â€œjust totally unacceptable.â€ Governments around the country were rapidly embarking on new containment efforts on Wednesday as the   rose to more than 1,200, a day after jumping by more than one-third. People in 42 states and the District of Columbia have now tested positive for the virus, and there have been at least 37 related deaths. Nowhere have the moves become more drastic and more urgent than in the Seattle area, where the state banned public gatherings of 250 people or more in three counties. Within hours, several local school districts with a combined enrollment of about 100,000 students said they would close for at least two weeks; a Patti Smith concert was postponed; and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle canceled all public masses, becoming the first Catholic archdiocese in the country to do so. In San Francisco, where Mayor London N. Breed announced   of more than 1,000 people, the San Francisco Giants announced that their exhibition game against the Oakland Athletics scheduled for March 24 would not take place at Oracle Park. Ohioâ€™s governor said he would impose a similar ban after new evidence concluded that the virus was spreading through community transmission in the state. â€œPeople are going to say, â€˜Oh my God, really, youâ€™re doing that?â€™â€ Governor DeWine  . â€œYouâ€™re going to look back on it in a week and say, â€˜That wasnâ€™t a difficult decision.â€™â€ In New York, the state and city universities and colleges, with about 700,000 students in all, will shift primarily to online classes starting on March 19, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday. Many other  , and some have told students not to return after their spring breaks.  The now-canceled St. Patrickâ€™s Day Parade in Manhattan is one of the cityâ€™s largest recurring public events, drawing roughly 150,000 marchers and two million spectators. The Times is answering some of the most common questions that readers are asking about how they can prepare for the coronavirus, how they can boost their immune systems and how they should react to the market. (Donâ€™t, probably.) A top federal health official gave lawmakers a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus would continue to spread in the United States, and said that fans should be barred from big gatherings like National Basketball Association games. â€œThe bottom line: It is going to get worse,â€ Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight Committee. â€œWe would recommend that there not be large crowds,â€ he added. â€œIf that means not having any people in the audience as the N.B.A. plays, so be it.â€ Dr. Fauci sought to rebut the claim â€” repeated often by President Trump â€” that the coronavirus was no worse than the flu. â€œPeople always say, â€˜Well, the flu does this, the flu does that.â€™ The flu has a mortality of 0.1 percent. This has a mortality of 10 times that,â€ Dr. Fauci said. A supply shortage is looming that could keep laboratories around the United States from meeting the ballooning demand for coronavirus testing. For weeks, doctors and labs have complained that there werenâ€™t nearly enough test kits to take samples from all the patients who showed signs of infection. That shortfall is easing after a botched rollout, but is not over. Laboratories warn that they are running low on supplies used to extract viral RNA from nasal swabs â€” supplies that are not included in the kits. Some lab directors have also had trouble getting the virus samples needed to validate their tests. And many are worried about a possible shortage of reagents, the chemicals used in the tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week that labs could test one swab per patient, rather than two, cutting the chemical demand in half. Qiagen, a major manufacturer of the RNA extraction kits, said in a statement this week that it was increasing production in sites in Germany, Spain and Maryland. The C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration have said they are aware of potential shortages and are monitoring supplies, but it is not clear what they might do to address the problems. Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday said that the coronavirus was likely to infect about two-thirds of the German population. But her top medical adviser, Dr. Lothar Weiler, who appeared with her, added that, â€œwe donâ€™t know how fast that will happen.â€ One of the countryâ€™s top virologists recently said that it could take a year or two, or even longer, for that many people to become infected.  At a news conference, Ms. Merkel said: â€œGiven a virus for which there is no immunity and no immunization, we have to understand that many people will be infected. The consensus among experts is that 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected.â€ The heart of her message was that Germans should take precautions to ensure that the health system can handle the high number of people who could fall seriously ill. She urged people to stay at home as much as possible. â€œHow we respond matters,â€ Ms. Merkel said. â€œWe are playing for time.â€ â€œWe are at the start of a development that we cannot yet see the end of,â€ she told reporters in her first public appearance to address the epidemic, which has already infected more than 1,600 people in Germany. â€œBut we as a country will do whatever is necessary to do, working within the European bloc.â€ That readiness includes flexibility on spending, especially to help the small and midsize enterprises that are losing business, she said. â€œWe wonâ€™t ask every day, â€˜What does this mean for our deficit?â€™â€ said Ms. Merkel. Major events, including all large cultural performances in Berlin, Munich and elsewhere, have either been canceled or will take place without spectators.

Some lab directors have also had trouble getting the virus samples needed to validate their tests. And many are worried about a possible shortage of reagents, the chemicals used in the tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week that labs could test one swab per patient, rather than two, cutting the chemical demand in half. Qiagen, a major manufacturer of the RNA extraction kits, said in a statement this week that it was increasing production in sites in Germany, Spain and Maryland. The C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration have said they are aware of potential shortages and are monitoring supplies, but it is not clear what they might do to address the problems. Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday said that the coronavirus was likely to infect about two-thirds of the German population. But her top medical adviser, Dr. Lothar Weiler, who appeared with her, added that, â€œwe donâ€™t know how fast that will happen.â€ One of the countryâ€™s top virologists recently said that it could take a year or two, or even longer, for that many people to become infected.  At a news conference, Ms. Merkel said: â€œGiven a virus for which there is no immunity and no immunization, we have to understand that many people will be infected. The consensus among experts is that 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected.â€ The heart of her message was that Germans should take precautions to ensure that the health system can handle the high number of people who could fall seriously ill. She urged people to stay at home as much as possible. â€œHow we respond matters,â€ Ms. Merkel said. â€œWe are playing for time.â€ â€œWe are at the start of a development that we cannot yet see the end of,â€ she told reporters in her first public appearance to address the epidemic, which has already infected more than 1,600 people in Germany. â€œBut we as a country will do whatever is necessary to do, working within the European bloc.â€ That readiness includes flexibility on spending, especially to help the small and midsize enterprises that are losing business, she said. â€œWe wonâ€™t ask every day, â€˜What does this mean for our deficit?â€™â€ said Ms. Merkel. Major events, including all large cultural performances in Berlin, Munich and elsewhere, have either been canceled or will take place without spectators.

Advertisement \n","Y3 Advertisement Supported by Katsuhiro Otomo's ''Akira,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, is a phenomenal work of animation with all the hallmarks of an instant cult classic. Its post-apocalyptic mood, high-tech trappings, thrilling artwork and wide array of bizarre characters guarantee it a place in the pantheon of comic-strip science fiction. Based on Mr. Otomo's widely popular comic-book saga, ''Akira'' takes its name from a mysterious force that may be afoot in Neo-Tokyo, where the action takes place. In 2019, 31 years after World War III, the world has seemingly had a chance to return to normal. There are again high-school students, motorcycle gangs, corrupt Government officials and mystics who predict doom. ''Under the guise of culture,'' says one, ''we find desolation of the human heart.'' Mr. Otomo invests this dark flowering of post-nuclear civilization with a clean, mean beauty. The drawings of Neo-Tokyo by night are so intricately detailed that all the individual windows of huge skyscrapers appear distinct. And these night scenes glow with subtle, vibrant color. Never resorting to the gaudiness of much ordinary animation, Mr. Otomo uses a wide range of colors in thoughtful, interesting ways, and he enlivens his film with a constant sense of surprise. The movements and mutations seen here are tremendously varied and almost always unpredictable. Naturally, ''Akira'' will be most appealing to the specialty audience willing to unravel its well-developed and highly complicated plot. Central to this are Tetsuo, a teen-age gang member who becomes an unwitting guinea pig for top-secret Government experiments, and Kaneda, who is at different times Tetsuo's best friend and archrival. Also involved are Government and military forces, other gang members and a group of small, plaintive child psychics drawn in shades of greenish-gray. Even when delivering the most dire pronouncements, these characters speak with a decorousness that helps to give this pop-obsessed film its distinctly Japanese tone. Mr. Otomo and his army of highly skilled animators are at their best in conjuring up wildly turbulent special effects, which are rendered with great energy and ingenuity. ''Akira'' presents dozens of variations on the image of billowing smoke, in every imaginable range of colors. And when its characters hurtle though space, they do it with breathtaking energy. Among the film's typically strange and arresting sequences are one that shows tiny nursery toys transformed into huge, terrifying monsters, and another in which huge, frightening gobs of protoplasm spring out of the body of a frightened victim. Violent as it is on the surface, ''Akira'' is tranquil at its core. The story's sanest characters plead for the wise use of mankind's frightening new powers, lending the whole film the feeling of a cautionary tale. Akira Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo; screenplay by Mr. Otomo and Izo Hashimoto, based on Mr. Otomo's graphic novel; animation directors, Yoshio Takeuchi and Hiroaki Sato; produced by Ryohei Susuki and Shunzo Kato; released by Streamline Pictures.

This is based on their own definitions. Has COVID-19 been another catalyst for humanity to begin questioning why we trust the sources we do? Is it time for us to activate self-responsibility and begin setting aside the parent-child relationship we have with government? Before you begin... Take a moment and breathe. Place your hand over your chest area, near your heart. Breathe slowly into the area for about a minute, focusing on a sense of ease entering your mind and body.   to learn why we suggest this. According to the CDC: â€œBased on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 9.0% during week 25 to 5.9% during week 26, representing the tenth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC,â€ theÂ  .  went on to state: â€œ â€ That being said, itâ€™s important to note that death rates alone donâ€™t have an impact on whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic. The extent of the outbreak and how wide-spread it is also determines this. That being said, the CDC did state that itâ€™s on the â€œepidemic thresholdâ€ because, again, deaths attributed to COVID-19 decreased from the previous week, despite the fact that the mortality rates are indeed expected to increase. Things would be more clear if the CDC stated what a death percentage needs to be in order to meet certain classification characteristics, all we have is their word that the current death rate is at the â€˜epidemic threshold.â€™ Weâ€™ve primarily been seeing sharp declines in death rates and in most cases, any increase in cases are non-symptomatic individuals. There are reasons why some have lost their faith in the CDC, and find it hard to trust them when it comes to these kinds of matters. One of these reasons are the spider papers. A group called the CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research, or CDC SPIDER, put a list of complaints in a letter to the CDC Chief of Staff and providedÂ  to the public watchdog organizationÂ  . WeÂ areÂ aÂ groupÂ ofÂ scientistsÂ at CDC that are veryÂ concerned about the current state of ethicsÂ at ourÂ agency.Â Â ItÂ appearsÂ that ourÂ mission isÂ being influenced and shaped byÂ outside partiesÂ and rogueÂ interests.Â ItÂ seemsÂ that ourÂ mission and Congressional intent for our agencyÂ isÂ being circumventedÂ byÂ someÂ of ourÂ leaders. What concernsÂ usÂ most, isÂ that it isÂ becoming the norm andÂ notÂ theÂ rareÂ exception. Some seniorÂ management officialsÂ at CDC are clearlyÂ aware and evenÂ condoneÂ theseÂ behaviors. There have even been multiple scientists who   this months ago but were ridiculed for it. Media and government continue to report on â€˜new casesâ€™ every single day as testing continues. While some are raising concerns about the actual testing itself. For example,Â he Bulgarian Pathology AssociationÂ has taken the stance that the testing used to identify the new coronavirus in patients is â€œscientifically meaningless.â€ They cite an article explaining the science. You can learn more about that  . We saw this same concern in  , among other places. As many outside mainstream consensus spoke about since late February, testing results show that more people have likely contracted COVID-19 than testing data reflects. This means even way back then, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was lower than any of the extreme estimates that came out of government and health agencies. All of which have been proven wrong along the way. Those who have  , like us here at CE, have had to deal with shadow banning on social media, fact checking fallacies, and demonetization as a result of reporting on the facts instead of the hysteria. The sad part is, everything we have reported on and suggested would soon happen did and yet we have been constantly â€˜punishedâ€™ for it. Death rates were not as high as thought, testing is not accurate, and this virus is not near as serious as itâ€™s being made out to be â€“ point blank, there was no need for a lockdown. But given there was a lockdown, we can look to either complete government incompetency or the fact that there is likely much more going on here behind the scenes than many people want to admit to. Further to that, and going deeper, we can ask how this lockdown and entire virus situation was actually serving the collective to see whatâ€™s really going on in our world and why it might be time to bring about some BIG change. Remember, itâ€™s not the people vs. the deep state, they simply play a role in pushing the evolution of consciousness. I cover this inÂ  More statistics and events are coming to the surface showing that we have been misled greatly about the recent pandemic, a great example were the early model predictions many scientists believed created unnecessary fear and hysteria. How is it that people with so few resources and access knew the truth before massive and â€˜trustedâ€™ sources did with regards to the infection fatality rate, and more. Was it another catalyst for humanity to begin questioning why they trust these sources? Was it another catalyst for people to begin listening to well backed and grounded â€˜alternativeâ€™Â  ideas as they consistently turn out to be true? Given the fact our infrastructures collapsed so quickly, is it an opportunity for us to re-imagine our world? Re-imagine whatâ€™s possible and truly question the type of world we wish to live in? Is it time for us to activate self responsibility and begin setting aside the parent-child relationship we have with government? Itâ€™s all been a catalyst.

Â Those who have done extensive research on UFOs will find the Australian version of disclosure to be far more intellectually honest than the American version. Albeit it was conducted decades ago. According to ex-US intelligence official Luis Elizondo, the Defense Departmentâ€™s Inspector General is presently conducting three reviews. The inquiries vary from the Department of Defenseâ€™s handling of UFO claims to Elizondoâ€™s alleged whistleblower retribution. The open IG cases are crucial to Australiaâ€™s report because they establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that the US Department of Defense is being dishonest and shady when it comes to the UFO subject. For decades, Australia has been a loyal friend of the United States. Within Australiaâ€™s boundaries, they share a military installation (Pine Gap). When a close defense allyâ€™s intelligence agencies determined that the US was not being intellectually honest in its approach, perhaps it is reasonable to conclude that there is more to the tale than the 144 incidents studied since 2004 by the UAPTF. The CIA became alarmed at the overloading of military communications during the mass sightings of 1952 and considered the possibility that the USSR may take advantage of such a situation. According to the summary, OSI, acting through the Robertson-Panel, encouraged the USAF to use Project Blue Book to publicly â€œdebunkâ€ UFOs. In a tragic twist of fate, when Australian authorities sought explanations from the US Air Force, the allegation was debunked. The authors of the study were depicted as conspiratorial and even crazy by the US Air Force.Â  Â Courthart is an award-winning investigative journalist who is drawn to forbidden subjects.

The US recently released its highly anticipatedÂ  , but it wasnâ€™t much more than a 9 page rundown of what has been known for decades. Regardless, for many, what was promising was that the UFO subject was being taken seriously again â€“ and perhaps many more scientists might get involved. For decades many have been warning about leaving UFO disclosure in the hands of a government that likes to use crisisâ€™ or current events to expand its defense budgets. Further, why would we suddenly expect a government, who has been lying about this subject for 70 years, to suddenly come forth with the truth? What would inspire them to suddenly change their mind? Perhaps itâ€™s because the search for ET is an idea whoâ€™s time has truly come. Weâ€™ve reporting on this for over 13 years, and are mongst a community of researchers who have been encouraging humanity to look at the evidence for more than 70 years. It feels like an idea that human collective consciousness is more than ready to explore. The impact the ET question has on our individual and collective worldview has the power to truly change the way we view ourselves and the meaning of life here on earth.

Published on By The PGA Tour has announced that it will stop testing players every week, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not. Are PCR tests appropriate to identify infectious people? Should people who are healthy and not sick be tested at all, anywhere? Before you begin... Take a moment and breathe. Place your hand over your chest area, near your heart. Breathe slowly into the area for about a minute, focusing on a sense of ease entering your mind and body.   to learn why we suggest this. The picture you see above is of John Rahm, a professional golfer on the PGA tour being carted off the golf course after tournament officials told him he had COVID. He was healthy and had no symptoms, yet was forced to withdraw from the tournament. He was told in front of the cameraâ€™s, and a big scene was made out of the event. You would think something like that, especially when you are a big time sports figure, would be done behind closed doors with some privacy. Earlier on in June a spokesperson for the PGA Tour said that more than 50 percent of players on the PGA tour have been vaccinated. Although it seems that the majority of players on the tour will be fully vaccinated judging by this statement, it does leave a fairly large minority who wonâ€™t be, and thatâ€™s something weâ€™re seeing across the globe as COVID vaccine hesitancy remains high for multiple reasons. We are pleased to announce, after consultation with PGA Tour medical advisors, that due to the high rate of vaccination among all constituents on the PGA Tour, as well as other positively trending factors across the country, testing for COVID-19 will no longer be required as a condition of competition beginning with the 3M Open. â€“ PGA tour Senior VP  The tour recently   that the testing of players every week will stop starting in July for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. This was an unexpected announcement given the fact that, at least it seems in some countries, vaccinated individuals will enjoy previous rights and freedoms that everyone did before the pandemic. Travelling without need to quarantine and possibly in the future not having to be tested could be a few of those privileges. Others may include attending concerts, sporting events, or perhaps even keeping their job depending on whether or not their employer deems it to be mandatory, if thatâ€™s even legally possible. We will see what happens. Luckily for professional golfers, regardless of their vaccination status they wonâ€™t have to worry about testing positive for COVID, especially if theyâ€™re not sick. This is the appropriate move by the PGA tour, who is represented by their players and itâ€™s a move that the players themselves may have had a say in. Itâ€™s important because PCR tests are not designed nor are they appropriate for identifying infectious people. A number of scientists have been emphasizing this since the beginning of the pandemic. More recently,   published in the Journal of infection explain why more than half of al â€œpositiveâ€ PCR tests are likely to have been people who are not infectious, otherwise known as â€œfalse positives.â€ This is why the Swedish Public Health agencyÂ  Â explaining how and why polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are not useful for determining if someone is infected with COVID or if someone can transmit it to others, and itâ€™s better to use someone who is actually showing symptoms as a judgement call of whether or not they could be infected or free from infection. PCR tests using a high cycle threshold are extremely sensitive.Â  Â in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that among positive PCR samples with a cycle count over 35, only 3 percent of the samples showed viral replication. This can be interpreted as, if someone tests positive via PCR when a Ct of 35 or higher is used, the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97 percent. This begs the question, why has Manitoba, Canada, for example,   of up to 45 to identify â€œpositiveâ€ people? When it comes to golf, the fact that spread occurring in an outdoor setting is highly unlikely could have been a factor, but itâ€™s also important to mention that  .

Place your hand over your chest area, near your heart. Breathe slowly into the area for about a minute, focusing on a sense of ease entering your mind and body.   to learn why we suggest this. According to the CDC: â€œBased on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 9.0% during week 25 to 5.9% during week 26, representing the tenth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC,â€ theÂ  .  went on to state: â€œ â€ That being said, itâ€™s important to note that death rates alone donâ€™t have an impact on whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic. The extent of the outbreak and how wide-spread it is also determines this. That being said, the CDC did state that itâ€™s on the â€œepidemic thresholdâ€ because, again, deaths attributed to COVID-19 decreased from the previous week, despite the fact that the mortality rates are indeed expected to increase. Things would be more clear if the CDC stated what a death percentage needs to be in order to meet certain classification characteristics, all we have is their word that the current death rate is at the â€˜epidemic threshold.â€™ Weâ€™ve primarily been seeing sharp declines in death rates and in most cases, any increase in cases are non-symptomatic individuals. There are reasons why some have lost their faith in the CDC, and find it hard to trust them when it comes to these kinds of matters. One of these reasons are the spider papers. A group called the CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research, or CDC SPIDER, put a list of complaints in a letter to the CDC Chief of Staff and providedÂ  to the public watchdog organizationÂ  . WeÂ areÂ aÂ groupÂ ofÂ scientistsÂ at CDC that are veryÂ concerned about the current state of ethicsÂ at ourÂ agency.Â Â ItÂ appearsÂ that ourÂ mission isÂ being influenced and shaped byÂ outside partiesÂ and rogueÂ interests.Â ItÂ seemsÂ that ourÂ mission and Congressional intent for our agencyÂ isÂ being circumventedÂ byÂ someÂ of ourÂ leaders. What concernsÂ usÂ most, isÂ that it isÂ becoming the norm andÂ notÂ theÂ rareÂ exception. Some seniorÂ management officialsÂ at CDC are clearlyÂ aware and evenÂ condoneÂ theseÂ behaviors. There have even been multiple scientists who   this months ago but were ridiculed for it. Media and government continue to report on â€˜new casesâ€™ every single day as testing continues. While some are raising concerns about the actual testing itself. For example,Â he Bulgarian Pathology AssociationÂ has taken the stance that the testing used to identify the new coronavirus in patients is â€œscientifically meaningless.â€ They cite an article explaining the science. You can learn more about that  . We saw this same concern in  , among other places. As many outside mainstream consensus spoke about since late February, testing results show that more people have likely contracted COVID-19 than testing data reflects. This means even way back then, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was lower than any of the extreme estimates that came out of government and health agencies. All of which have been proven wrong along the way. Those who have  , like us here at CE, have had to deal with shadow banning on social media, fact checking fallacies, and demonetization as a result of reporting on the facts instead of the hysteria. The sad part is, everything we have reported on and suggested would soon happen did and yet we have been constantly â€˜punishedâ€™ for it. Death rates were not as high as thought, testing is not accurate, and this virus is not near as serious as itâ€™s being made out to be â€“ point blank, there was no need for a lockdown. But given there was a lockdown, we can look to either complete government incompetency or the fact that there is likely much more going on here behind the scenes than many people want to admit to. Further to that, and going deeper, we can ask how this lockdown and entire virus situation was actually serving the collective to see whatâ€™s really going on in our world and why it might be time to bring about some BIG change. Remember, itâ€™s not the people vs. the deep state, they simply play a role in pushing the evolution of consciousness. I cover this inÂ  More statistics and events are coming to the surface showing that we have been misled greatly about the recent pandemic, a great example were the early model predictions many scientists believed created unnecessary fear and hysteria. How is it that people with so few resources and access knew the truth before massive and â€˜trustedâ€™ sources did with regards to the infection fatality rate, and more. Was it another catalyst for humanity to begin questioning why they trust these sources? Was it another catalyst for people to begin listening to well backed and grounded â€˜alternativeâ€™Â  ideas as they consistently turn out to be true? Given the fact our infrastructures collapsed so quickly, is it an opportunity for us to re-imagine our world? Re-imagine whatâ€™s possible and truly question the type of world we wish to live in? Is it time for us to activate self responsibility and begin setting aside the parent-child relationship we have with government? Itâ€™s all been a catalyst.

Â Those who have done extensive research on UFOs will find the Australian version of disclosure to be far more intellectually honest than the American version. Albeit it was conducted decades ago. According to ex-US intelligence official Luis Elizondo, the Defense Departmentâ€™s Inspector General is presently conducting three reviews. The inquiries vary from the Department of Defenseâ€™s handling of UFO claims to Elizondoâ€™s alleged whistleblower retribution. The open IG cases are crucial to Australiaâ€™s report because they establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that the US Department of Defense is being dishonest and shady when it comes to the UFO subject. For decades, Australia has been a loyal friend of the United States. Within Australiaâ€™s boundaries, they share a military installation (Pine Gap). When a close defense allyâ€™s intelligence agencies determined that the US was not being intellectually honest in its approach, perhaps it is reasonable to conclude that there is more to the tale than the 144 incidents studied since 2004 by the UAPTF. The CIA became alarmed at the overloading of military communications during the mass sightings of 1952 and considered the possibility that the USSR may take advantage of such a situation. According to the summary, OSI, acting through the Robertson-Panel, encouraged the USAF to use Project Blue Book to publicly â€œdebunkâ€ UFOs. In a tragic twist of fate, when Australian authorities sought explanations from the US Air Force, the allegation was debunked. The authors of the study were depicted as conspiratorial and even crazy by the US Air Force.Â  Â Courthart is an award-winning investigative journalist who is drawn to forbidden subjects.

The US recently released its highly anticipatedÂ  , but it wasnâ€™t much more than a 9 page rundown of what has been known for decades. Regardless, for many, what was promising was that the UFO subject was being taken seriously again â€“ and perhaps many more scientists might get involved. For decades many have been warning about leaving UFO disclosure in the hands of a government that likes to use crisisâ€™ or current events to expand its defense budgets. Further, why would we suddenly expect a government, who has been lying about this subject for 70 years, to suddenly come forth with the truth? What would inspire them to suddenly change their mind? Perhaps itâ€™s because the search for ET is an idea whoâ€™s time has truly come. Weâ€™ve reporting on this for over 13 years, and are mongst a community of researchers who have been encouraging humanity to look at the evidence for more than 70 years. It feels like an idea that human collective consciousness is more than ready to explore. The impact the ET question has on our individual and collective worldview has the power to truly change the way we view ourselves and the meaning of life here on earth.

Published on By The PGA Tour has announced that it will stop testing players every week, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not. Are PCR tests appropriate to identify infectious people? Should people who are healthy and not sick be tested at all, anywhere? Before you begin... Take a moment and breathe. Place your hand over your chest area, near your heart. Breathe slowly into the area for about a minute, focusing on a sense of ease entering your mind and body.   to learn why we suggest this. The picture you see above is of John Rahm, a professional golfer on the PGA tour being carted off the golf course after tournament officials told him he had COVID. He was healthy and had no symptoms, yet was forced to withdraw from the tournament. He was told in front of the cameraâ€™s, and a big scene was made out of the event. You would think something like that, especially when you are a big time sports figure, would be done behind closed doors with some privacy. Earlier on in June a spokesperson for the PGA Tour said that more than 50 percent of players on the PGA tour have been vaccinated. Although it seems that the majority of players on the tour will be fully vaccinated judging by this statement, it does leave a fairly large minority who wonâ€™t be, and thatâ€™s something weâ€™re seeing across the globe as COVID vaccine hesitancy remains high for multiple reasons. We are pleased to announce, after consultation with PGA Tour medical advisors, that due to the high rate of vaccination among all constituents on the PGA Tour, as well as other positively trending factors across the country, testing for COVID-19 will no longer be required as a condition of competition beginning with the 3M Open. â€“ PGA tour Senior VP  The tour recently   that the testing of players every week will stop starting in July for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. This was an unexpected announcement given the fact that, at least it seems in some countries, vaccinated individuals will enjoy previous rights and freedoms that everyone did before the pandemic. Travelling without need to quarantine and possibly in the future not having to be tested could be a few of those privileges. Others may include attending concerts, sporting events, or perhaps even keeping their job depending on whether or not their employer deems it to be mandatory, if thatâ€™s even legally possible. We will see what happens. Luckily for professional golfers, regardless of their vaccination status they wonâ€™t have to worry about testing positive for COVID, especially if theyâ€™re not sick. This is the appropriate move by the PGA tour, who is represented by their players and itâ€™s a move that the players themselves may have had a say in. Itâ€™s important because PCR tests are not designed nor are they appropriate for identifying infectious people. A number of scientists have been emphasizing this since the beginning of the pandemic. More recently,   published in the Journal of infection explain why more than half of al â€œpositiveâ€ PCR tests are likely to have been people who are not infectious, otherwise known as â€œfalse positives.â€ This is why the Swedish Public Health agencyÂ  Â explaining how and why polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are not useful for determining if someone is infected with COVID or if someone can transmit it to others, and itâ€™s better to use someone who is actually showing symptoms as a judgement call of whether or not they could be infected or free from infection. PCR tests using a high cycle threshold are extremely sensitive.Â  Â in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that among positive PCR samples with a cycle count over 35, only 3 percent of the samples showed viral replication. This can be interpreted as, if someone tests positive via PCR when a Ct of 35 or higher is used, the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97 percent. This begs the question, why has Manitoba, Canada, for example,   of up to 45 to identify â€œpositiveâ€ people? When it comes to golf, the fact that spread occurring in an outdoor setting is highly unlikely could have been a factor, but itâ€™s also important to mention that  .

(AP)\n"," In the span of one year, Americans went from hearing about a new virus in central China to watching the slow rollout of a vaccine, with only a small percentage of Americans able to access it in the first several weeks.Â  In between, they endured months of stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and requirements to wear masks in many public spaces as the monthly case and death tolls rose. President Donald Trump went from dismissing the threat of the virus â€” publicly at least â€” to taking credit when the vaccine was approved for emergency use. Between his Twitter posts, campaign rallies and daily press conferences, Trump became the foremost mouthpiece for the federal governmentâ€™s virus response. But he routinely distorted the facts, and then caught the virus himself as his own White House became a hotspot for infection. Trump told the nation we were \"rounding the corner\" even as cases continued to rise in the fall. He and his administration overpromised about when Americans could get the vaccine and how fast the rollout would proceed. The story of Trump and the coronavirus can be broken down into a series of phases: the emergence of the threat; the governmentâ€™s focus on keeping it out of the United States; the flailing effort to contain the spread; Trumpâ€™s positive test; his return to the campaign trail; his election loss followed by announcements about vaccine trials; and finally emergency use approval of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccines followed by their rollout to the states.

I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\" As this timeline shows, Trump minimized the threat of a pandemic for many weeks.  Asked if the World Health Organization had offered detection tests to the United States, Trump said WHO had not, and that the WHO coronavirus test \"was a bad test.\"  .

COVID-19 cases are \"up only because of our big number testing.\"  As both testing and new cases rise, Trump argued that the first caused the second. But if that were true, the share of tests coming back positive would hold steady or fall. In 12 days, between June 10 and June 22, the positivity rate rose by about 25%. We rated Trumpâ€™s claim  . \"We have tested over 40 million people.

Daily hospitalizations were at 4% of cases.Â  We rated this  . \"We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\"  Trump said the United States compared quite favorably with other countries in preventing deaths from the virus.

In a marked shift in tone, he warned that harder times were on the way. Before, Trump had downplayed the need to wear masks. That message changed. \"Weâ€™re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask,\" Trump said. \"Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.Â  Theyâ€™ll have an effect. And we need everything we can get.\"  Trump downplayed the chances that children would catch COVID-19 and urged schools to reopen. \"Children are \"almost immune from this disease.\" Itâ€™s wrong to say children are \"almost immune\" to the virus. Before he spoke, there were cases spread at an overnight camp in the U.S. and at some schools overseas, including in Israel. We rated this statement  .Â  : Trump says on   that a vaccine could be available before the end of the year â€” or \"right around\" the Nov. 3 election.

(AP)\n"," In the span of one year, Americans went from hearing about a new virus in central China to watching the slow rollout of a vaccine, with only a small percentage of Americans able to access it in the first several weeks.Â  In between, they endured months of stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and requirements to wear masks in many public spaces as the monthly case and death tolls rose. President Donald Trump went from dismissing the threat of the virus â€” publicly at least â€” to taking credit when the vaccine was approved for emergency use. Between his Twitter posts, campaign rallies and daily press conferences, Trump became the foremost mouthpiece for the federal governmentâ€™s virus response. But he routinely distorted the facts, and then caught the virus himself as his own White House became a hotspot for infection. Trump told the nation we were \"rounding the corner\" even as cases continued to rise in the fall. He and his administration overpromised about when Americans could get the vaccine and how fast the rollout would proceed. The story of Trump and the coronavirus can be broken down into a series of phases: the emergence of the threat; the governmentâ€™s focus on keeping it out of the United States; the flailing effort to contain the spread; Trumpâ€™s positive test; his return to the campaign trail; his election loss followed by announcements about vaccine trials; and finally emergency use approval of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccines followed by their rollout to the states.

I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\" As this timeline shows, Trump minimized the threat of a pandemic for many weeks.  Asked if the World Health Organization had offered detection tests to the United States, Trump said WHO had not, and that the WHO coronavirus test \"was a bad test.\"  . WHO said three independent labs had validated the test, and the White House coordinator for coronavirus response said she assumed the WHO test is effective.Â   The U.S. Senate unveils a   package.

Doctors and coroners follow established guidelines on the cause of death, and false reporting is a crime.  At an  , Trump repeated a number of falsehoods and exaggerations about the state of the crisis, the efficacy of face masks and pandemic-driven immigration restrictions. Trump repeated a false characterization of a small survey when he said \"just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.\"  States are required by this date to  , even though they face several unknowns, including when the vaccine will arrive, how many doses they will get, and how much money they will get to cover distribution costs. \"We are rounding the turn\" on coronavirus. \"We are rounding the corner.\"Â   During a debate with Biden, Trump says, \"We are rounding the corner\" on the coronavirus. That statement was   At the time, cases had been rising steadily since mid-September, hospitalizations had been rising for almost two weeks, and positivity rates had been rising since the end of September.

U.S. surpasses 15 million COVID-19 cases.Â At his  , Trump promises a quick vaccine rollout. \"If authorized, tens of millions of vaccine doses will be available this month and weâ€™ll get it distributed very quickly. We have that all set and hundreds of millions more will quickly follow. Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine. And we think by spring, weâ€™re going to be in a position that nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago. Amazing, really amazing. They say itâ€™s somewhat of a miracle. And I think thatâ€™s true.\" Trump calls on governors to first vaccinate seniors and people in health care who work with seniors. \"This will quickly and dramatically reduce deaths and hospitalizations. And within a short period of time, I think we want to get back to normal.\"  An advisory panel recommends that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration grant emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine.

Fauci disputes Trumpâ€™s account. \"Well, the deaths are real deaths,\" Fauci says on  .\" \"All you need to do is to go out into the trenches, go to the hospitals, see what the health care workers are dealing with. They are under very stressed situations in many areas of the country. The hospital beds are stretched. People are running out of beds, running out of trained personnel, who are exhausted right now. That's real. That's not fake. That's real.\" The Trump administration announces it will release the federal governmentâ€™s entire vaccine stockpile to the states, rather than holding supplies in reserve for second doses. Days later, the   that at the time of the announcement, all supplies had already been released, and no such stockpile existed. Trump is   for the second time, one week after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol while both houses of Congress were in session to certify election results. The articles of impeachment said Trump incited the crowd and endangered the security of the United States. Trump said in a video statement: \"Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop.\"Â  By Trumpâ€™s final full day in office, the U.S. had recorded a total of   and almost 400,000 deaths.

Thousands of pages of communications obtained by BuzzFeed News show how Fauci tried to keep Americans calm and develop an effective strategy despite conflicts with the Trump administration. By\n","      \n","          and \n","      \n","         \n"," \n","    Last updated on June 2, 2021, at 6:28 p.m. ET\n","     \n","    Posted on June 1, 2021, at 1:59 p.m. ET\n","     Anthony Fauci waits to testify on Capitol Hill in June 2020 The womanâ€™s email arrived in Anthony Fauciâ€™s inbox on Feb. 28, 2020, with a one-word subject line: â€œURGENT.â€ The coronavirus crisis was still in its early stages, and Fauci, the US governmentâ€™s top infectious disease scientist, was already under tremendous pressure, both because of the health threat facing the country and the political climate fostered by the Trump administration. â€œI understand Vice President Pence has ordered you to not inform the public about Coronavirus without approval. This is quite terrifying, especially since Trump has already shown his desire to spread false or incomplete information about this public health crisis,â€ the woman wrote. She had tracked down Fauciâ€™s email, which is not easily accessible on government websites, because she had a pressing question: â€œIâ€™m planning to fly domestically TOMORROW [REDACTED]. Is it safe??â€ Of course, Fauci had urgent matters of his own to attend to, but he replied to the stranger anyway the next day. â€œThere is much misinformation,â€ he wrote back. â€œI actually have not been muzzled at all by the Vice President. And BTW, it is safe to fly domestically [REDACTED].â€  obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed News â€” covering the period from January to June 2020 â€” provide a rare glimpse into how Fauci approached his job during the biggest health crisis of the last century, showing him dealing directly with the public, health officials, reporters, and even celebrities. (The Washington Post also received more than 800 pages of emails and   about them on Monday.) The emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News reveal him sparring over an antiviral drug with Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Obama administration health adviser, fielding questions about vaccines, and receiving an update from Mark Zuckerberg on Facebookâ€™s plans for a coronavirus â€œinformation hub.â€ Zuckerberg also asked whether the social media company could provide resources to accelerate vaccine testing. And Fauci even responded to an offer from actor Morgan Fairchild to use her Twitter account on his behalf. â€œIt would be great if you could tweet to your many Twitter followers,â€ he responded to Fairchild. â€œThe American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures including social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc.â€ The emails show Fauci received a flurry of correspondence about the theory that coronavirus leaked from a lab in Wuhan. One such email sent to Fauci on April 16, 2020 by Francis Collins, the director of the National Institute of Health, under the subject line \"conspiracy gains momentum\" contained a link to a news story highlighting a Fox News report that said the allegation had merit. Fauci's response to Collins is entirely blacked out. The records also lay bare Fauci's ambivalence toward his newfound celebrity status but also his embrace of a documentary crew who would tell his story. Additionally, the emails hint at the personal toll this past year has taken on him. In one email sent on Feb. 18, weeks before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, he wrote that he had only been able to see his wife for 45 minutes in the previous 10 days. Fauci, who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, declined to comment for this story. Some of the emails were reviewed by the Trump White House before being turned over to BuzzFeed News. They represent just a portion of what was requested, and they are filled with redactions, making them an incomplete record of the time period and Fauciâ€™s correspondence. Additional tranches are expected to be released in the coming months. However, the emails do give a sense of the type of communicator Fauci is: courteous, low-key, and empathetic. He politely interacts with the office assistants who help him with his correspondence, and he sweats over the proper way to let people down. When a White House fellow and physician emails Fauci and offers to team up to write an opinion piece on the coronavirus and â€œunite the nation,â€ the NIAID director asks a colleague, â€œHow do we nicely say no to this person?â€ And when health professionals write him with harsh criticism of Trumpâ€™s handling of the pandemic, he doesnâ€™t take the bait. Instead, he replies with a \"thank you.\" His tone is a mix of friendly and formal, employing phrases like â€œlet us discuss,â€ â€œmany thanks,â€ and â€” in rare displays of displeasure â€” a delicate â€œyikes!â€ He signs off as â€œTony.â€ Even though he tends to sidestep controversy, Fauci does defend his decisions and push back. In March 2020, Fauci and a few other colleagues received an email from  , a prominent Yale School of Public Health epidemiologist, urging the NIAID director and his team to act promptly on the virus. The subject line was â€œWe Are Desperate for Advice.â€ â€œFor those I know, I donâ€™t doubt your commitment to public service,â€ Gonsalves wrote. â€œBut time is running out. We need vocally, unequivocal leadership now, that offers real guidance to communities about what to do, what might happen next.â€ Fauci clearly resented any implication that his health teamâ€™s response was being shaped by the political values of the Trump administration, and he responded curtly three hours later. â€œGregg: I am surprised you included me in your note,\" he wrote. \"I genuflect to no one but science and always, always speak my mind when it comes to public health. I have consistently corrected misstatements by others and will continue to do so.â€ Fauci, 80, has tackled the worldâ€™s most difficult health crises and infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and Zika, earning respect in his field and the trust of many Americans. As the COVID-19 crisis deepened, his inbox filled with queries from people seeking guidance, solace, or morsels of medical advice. He also provided guidance to Sylvia Burwell, the former Health and Human Services secretary, who emailed Fauci on Feb. 5. 2020 and asked him if she should take a mask to the airport. \"Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection,\" Fauci wrote. \"The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material. It might, however, provide some slight benefit in keep out gross droplets if someone coughs or sneezes on you. I do not recommend that you wear a mask, particularly since you are going to a vey low risk location.\" On March 4, under the subject line â€œA humble request for your wisdom,â€ a woman wrote to Fauci and asked whether a person inoculated against pneumonia would be protected against COVID-19. One hour later, at 9:45 p.m. on a Wednesday, Fauci replied that complications from COVID-19 are â€œheavily skewedâ€ toward people who are older or have underlying conditions. He went into a lengthy explanation: â€œMost of the pneumonias are pure viral pneumonia and so this vaccination will not help that,â€ he wrote. â€œHowever, on the chance that you have a pure viral pneumonia that gets secondarily complicated by a bacterial pneumonia (pneumococcal) the vaccine would be beneficial. â€œIf you are 65 years of age or older, you should get pneumonvax23 anyway regardless of the risk of coronavirus infection. Thanks, Tony.â€ Five minutes later, the woman wrote back, â€œOh my god. â€¦ I honestly never expected you to reply and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being so generous!â€ Some writers emailed mainly to vent. Among them: a Florida infectious disease specialist who was upset that some Americans were not taking proper precautions. â€œI am putting my life on the line so folks can go pump iron, drink beer, have a burger and get a tan,â€ Doug Brust emailed Fauci on March 18. \"The band is playing on. Again,â€ Brust wrote, a reference to one of the most famous books of the AIDS epidemic,  , which exposed the hapless efforts of the government and the public medical establishment to address the health crisis. And reporters, of course, reached out with questions for the doctor considered the countryâ€™s foremost expert. One email exchange, however, shows how even Fauci couldnâ€™t see all that was coming. Just a day after   in the United States, the managing editor of ABC Newsâ€™ medical unit emailed Fauci and asked him if he agreed with what a source at the Department of Homeland Security told him: that epidemiology models showed that 98 million people could be infected with COVID-19 and deaths from the virus could reach 500,000. â€œThat seems exceptionally high,â€ Fauci responded. His guidance was not always welcomed by his own bosses at the White House. He faced a  , including angry tweets from Trump that questioned his expertise. Those conflicts also get referenced in the emails. In April, a top Chinese health official emailed Fauci about vaccines. As part of that thread, the official expressed concern about him â€œbeing attacked by some people.â€ â€œThank you for your kind note. All is well despite some crazy people in this world,â€ Fauci replied. Even as he gained enemies and roused critics, many of the emails also reflect his growing stature around the world. â€œDear â€” highly respected â€” Dr. Fauci,â€ a doctor from Austria writes in bolded text. â€œWhy do I try to childishly support a respected expert and personally highly honored Gentleman like you â€” Dr. Fauxi? Because for me â€” it is heartbreaking and unbelievably disturbing, what was and is going on of the last 4 months in the USA.â€ He goes on to lay out a strategy for nations to cope with the devastating effects of the pandemic. â€œNot a crazy note. Please respond on my behalf,â€ Fauci writes to a staff member. On May 5, 2020, Mary Harris, an NIAID employee, wrote: â€œI am grateful to say my Director is Dr. Anthony Fauci and share with my family, friends, and church that if you said it, itâ€™s gospel.â€ Along the way, the scientist was becoming a celebrity. Just a couple of months into the pandemic, T-shirts, bobbleheads, socks, and even prayer candles with his face plastered on them were being sold. Fauciâ€™s emails show he was clearly uncomfortable with the attention. â€œClick on the â€˜Cuomo Crushâ€™ and â€˜Fauci Feverâ€™ link below. It will blow your mind. Our society is really totally nuts,â€ Fauci wrote in an April 8, 2020, email he forwarded to undisclosed recipients after he received a Google alert about news stories mentioning his name. The previous month, a colleague had emailed Fauci a Washington Post article headlined â€œFauci Socks, Fauci Doughnuts, Fauci Fan Art: The Coronavirus Experts Attract a Cult Following.â€ The top of the article tells the story of a Rochester, New York, shop that had sold out of donuts with Fauci's face on them. â€œTruly surrealistic,â€ Fauci wrote. â€œHopefully this all stops soon.â€ Later, he added: â€œIt is not at all pleasant, that is for sure.â€ But it didnâ€™t stop, and, at times, Fauci actually couldnâ€™t help but get a kick out of it, including when Brad Pitt played him on  . â€œOne reviewer of the SNL show said that Pitt looked 'exactly like me.' That statement made my year, â€ Fauci wrote to a colleague. The emails also reveal behind-the-scenes negotiations over a documentary about Fauciâ€™s work. He first sent a note to his team about the project on April 12, a month after the World Health Organization had declared the coronavirus a pandemic. â€œLet us discuss this tomorrow before we do anything. No one has any â€˜exclusivesâ€™ on anything about me,â€ he wrote to his team. Still, there is little in his correspondence that strays from the central issues: the pandemic and how best to save lives. His exchanges with Ezekiel Emanuel, the former Obama health adviser, reflect the high stakes. Emanuel, an oncologist, bioethicist, and vice provost of the University of Pennsylvania, sent Fauci an email on Feb. 25, 2020, asking for an updated assessment of the virus and noting that he was having a â€œhard time seeing this as serious as everyone else.â€ â€œAm I blind? Yes very transmissible but low mortality like flu in many ways - the elderly, those with comorbidities, and total impact is likely to be less than flu,\" Emanuel wrote. Later, in April, Emanuel sent Fauci an email saying he was â€œperplexedâ€ by his â€œseeming strong endorsementâ€ of the antiviral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19. â€œWas it just a bit forced?â€ Emanuel asked. â€œMy reading was the data was weak and in normal times for normal disease it is not enough to approve. And very unlikely to really impact COVID-19 disease pattern--regardless of supply issues.â€ Fauci countered: â€œI did not â€˜stronglyâ€™ endorse it. I specifically said it was not a knockout drug and was only a baby step in the direction of developing more and better drugs. I said that it was important because it proved in a well-powered, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that one can suppress the virus enough to see a clinical effect, as modest as the effect was. I do not think I forced anything.â€ The next day, Emanuel sent another email, apologizing for misinterpreting Fauciâ€™s comments about the drug and inviting him over for dinner â€œon the porch.â€ â€œYou are a national â€” international â€” treasure.

By\n","      \n","          and \n","      \n","         \n"," \n","    Last updated on June 2, 2021, at 6:28 p.m. ET\n","     \n","    Posted on June 1, 2021, at 1:59 p.m. ET\n","     Anthony Fauci waits to testify on Capitol Hill in June 2020 The womanâ€™s email arrived in Anthony Fauciâ€™s inbox on Feb. 28, 2020, with a one-word subject line: â€œURGENT.â€ The coronavirus crisis was still in its early stages, and Fauci, the US governmentâ€™s top infectious disease scientist, was already under tremendous pressure, both because of the health threat facing the country and the political climate fostered by the Trump administration. â€œI understand Vice President Pence has ordered you to not inform the public about Coronavirus without approval. This is quite terrifying, especially since Trump has already shown his desire to spread false or incomplete information about this public health crisis,â€ the woman wrote. She had tracked down Fauciâ€™s email, which is not easily accessible on government websites, because she had a pressing question: â€œIâ€™m planning to fly domestically TOMORROW [REDACTED]. Is it safe??â€ Of course, Fauci had urgent matters of his own to attend to, but he replied to the stranger anyway the next day. â€œThere is much misinformation,â€ he wrote back. â€œI actually have not been muzzled at all by the Vice President. And BTW, it is safe to fly domestically [REDACTED].â€  obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed News â€” covering the period from January to June 2020 â€” provide a rare glimpse into how Fauci approached his job during the biggest health crisis of the last century, showing him dealing directly with the public, health officials, reporters, and even celebrities. (The Washington Post also received more than 800 pages of emails and   about them on Monday.) The emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News reveal him sparring over an antiviral drug with Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Obama administration health adviser, fielding questions about vaccines, and receiving an update from Mark Zuckerberg on Facebookâ€™s plans for a coronavirus â€œinformation hub.â€ Zuckerberg also asked whether the social media company could provide resources to accelerate vaccine testing. And Fauci even responded to an offer from actor Morgan Fairchild to use her Twitter account on his behalf. â€œIt would be great if you could tweet to your many Twitter followers,â€ he responded to Fairchild. â€œThe American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures including social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc.â€ The emails show Fauci received a flurry of correspondence about the theory that coronavirus leaked from a lab in Wuhan. One such email sent to Fauci on April 16, 2020 by Francis Collins, the director of the National Institute of Health, under the subject line \"conspiracy gains momentum\" contained a link to a news story highlighting a Fox News report that said the allegation had merit. Fauci's response to Collins is entirely blacked out. The records also lay bare Fauci's ambivalence toward his newfound celebrity status but also his embrace of a documentary crew who would tell his story. Additionally, the emails hint at the personal toll this past year has taken on him. In one email sent on Feb. 18, weeks before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, he wrote that he had only been able to see his wife for 45 minutes in the previous 10 days. Fauci, who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, declined to comment for this story. Some of the emails were reviewed by the Trump White House before being turned over to BuzzFeed News. They represent just a portion of what was requested, and they are filled with redactions, making them an incomplete record of the time period and Fauciâ€™s correspondence. Additional tranches are expected to be released in the coming months. However, the emails do give a sense of the type of communicator Fauci is: courteous, low-key, and empathetic.

Cases have started spiking in Boone County since students moved back to Mizzou earlier this month, with the countyâ€™s seven-day positivity rate climbing from 10.6 percent on Aug. 20 to 44.6 percent this week, nearly four times the state's positivity rate of 12.3 percent. Boone County reported 81 new positive cases on Friday, including 51 from the 18- to 22-year-old age range. UM System President and Mizzou Chancellor Mun Choi said Friday that none of the infected MU students have required hospitalization. As of Friday, there were 306 active cases among MU students, up from 228 on Wednesday. Of the 367 student cases reported since Aug. 19, 70 have recovered. Choi said there are four or five students isolated in MU facilities. The school has rooms to isolate 60 students and has contracted extra rooms with area hotels. Starting Monday, MU will release self-reported positive cases for MU faculty, Choi said.Â  â€œWe know that we are going to have cases because we've seen it throughout the country,â€ Choi said. â€œBut itâ€™s our actions to mitigate and to address and to treat those patients that's going to be key.â€ â€œStudents and young people in that age group do recover at a very high rate,â€ he added. â€œAnd none of the students that have tested positive are living with others who have not been affected. None of those students are hospitalized. Going forward, we're going to continue to enforce our policies on the campus and off campus to ensure that we keep this community safe.â€ Mizzou has shifted some classes online but still offers in-person courses in classroom environments fitted for safe social distancing. Masks are required throughout campus. Choi defended MUâ€™s decision to continue with in-person classes and offered differences between MUâ€™s situation and the University of North Carolina, where campus leaders moved all classes online after a COVID breakout. â€œUNC leadership made the decision that made sense for that organization in that environment,â€ Choi said. â€œIf I compare Orange County, where UNC-Chapel Hill is located, to Boone County right here in Missouri, I recognize that population is about the same. The number of positive cases is about the same. While we have less than 10 deaths in Boone County (seven as of Friday), they have more than 50 in that county in North Carolina. We are prepared. We have more hospital beds that are staffed and the number of ICU beds is larger in Boone County by a factor of three.â€ On Friday, Stephanie Browning, the countyâ€™s health director, announced new restrictions for Columbia bars and restaurants.

All food and beverages must be consumed while seated at any bar or restaurant with table seating limited to a maximum of 10. Browning said she considered closing all Columbia bars indefinitely but settled for the new closing times. â€œWhat weâ€™re seeing in our violations is theyâ€™re coming late at night,â€ she said. â€œBig groups gathering, theyâ€™re not wearing their masks.

The funding will help strengthen detection, isolation and treatment efforts; protect at-risk populations; and develop vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. The new funding is inclusive of $10 million the foundation committed to the outbreak in late January. â€œMultilateral organizations, national governments, the private sector and philanthropies must work together to slow the pace of the outbreak, help countries protect their most vulnerable citizens and accelerate the development of the tools to bring this epidemic under control,â€ said Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman. â€œOur hope is that these resources will help catalyze a rapid and effective international response. This response should be guided by science, not fear, and it should build on the steps that the World Health Organization has taken to date.â€ The Gates Foundation is contributing more resources â€“ in close coordination with other donors â€“ to assist the World Health Organization (WHO), Chinese frontline responders and others at the global and national levels. WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, citing the risks the virus poses globally and the need for a worldwide coordinated effort to enhance preparedness, especially in fragile settings. The Government of China has also declared a national public health emergency and mobilized a nationwide effort to contain the virus and treat those who are infected. \n","The foundation will immediately commit up to $20 million to accelerate the detection, isolation and treatment of people diagnosed with the virus with the goal of interrupting transmission and containing the disease. This funding will be directed to multilateral organizations such as WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Support will also be directed to national public health authorities in China and other countries that have reported confirmed cases. Current national-level partners include the National Health Commission of China and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The release of fast and flexible funding is intended to help multilateral organizations and national public health authorities rapidly scale up their virus detection capabilities and implement disease modeling analytics so that they can target resources where they can have the greatest impact in arresting disease spread. This funding is intended to help public health authorities cover the initial cost of labor and supplies while international agencies and national governments appropriate the resources necessary to fund ongoing operations. \n","Recent epidemics, such as the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, have had a disproportionate impact on populations living in extreme poverty, and sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia together account for   of the estimated 629 million people worldwide who live on less than $1.90 per day. Many people living in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia also have limited access to quality primary health care, which is another factor that increases their health risks.

(AP/Long)\n","\n"," Medical experts and the CDC said itâ€™s not biologically possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to â€œshedâ€ or affect unvaccinated people, despite what anti-vaccine activists claim. The misinformation about â€œvaccine sheddingâ€ has had a real-world impact. One Miami private school recently instructed immunized teachers to stay away from students, citing the baseless claim that unvaccinated people can experience menstrual irregularities and other reproductive harm simply from interacting with vaccinated people. Â  In April, faculty and staff at a small Miami private school   telling them that if they chose to get the COVID-19 vaccine, they would have to keep their distance from the students. A week later, one fifth-grade student   home to her parents from the school. The teacher \"is telling us to stay away from you guys,\" the student wrote,    .Â  The episode at the Centner Academy is the latest example of online misinformation seeping into the real world. School co-founder Leila Centner framed the policy as a matter of protecting the unvaccinated people from \"being negatively impacted\" by those who got their COVID-19 shots.Â  \"We have at least three women with menstrual cycles impacted after having spent time with a vaccinated person,\" Centner said. The notion that the COVID-19 vaccines can be \"shed\" like the coronavirus itself \"is a conspiracy that has been created to weaken trust\" in the vaccines, said Christopher Zahn, vice president of practice activities at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The script-flipping narrative not only dissuades people from getting the vaccine, but also seeks to isolate or punish those who have. The misinformation has taken a hold anyway â€” well beyond one school in Miami.       vaccinated customers to stick to curbside pickup. And on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, users shared warnings that serious side effects, including menstrual irregularities and infertility, can come from contact with vaccinated people. PolitiFact talked to medical experts about what emerged in April as a prevailing narrative within the anti-vaccine community. The claims about \"vaccine shedding\" are not only false, but also biologically impossible given the construction of the COVID-19 vaccines.Â  \"There is absolutely no biological mechanism for any COVID-19 vaccine side effects or vaccine components to shed to others,\" said Dr. Shruti Gohil, the associate medical director for epidemiology and infection prevention at the University of California, Irvine. The notice sent out at Centner Academy stirred so much controversy that a reporter asked about it  . But the facts arenâ€™t up for debate. None of the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S. \"can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy,\" said Dr. Jennifer Gunter, a gynecologist who has written about the vaccines, in  . \"Let me be very clear. The COVID-19 vaccines cannot affect anyone by proxy.\" \"In fact, the opposite is true,\" added John Grabenstein, the associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition. \"By being vaccinated, one avoids being infected and so does not become a COVID-19 virus factory.\" The vaccines use different technologies to instruct cells to make versions of one spike protein found on the coronavirus, so the immune system can mount a response to it, said Dr. Paul A. Offit, chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Perelman School of Medicine. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses an adenovirus thatâ€™s been altered to make it harmless. In a statement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described the process this way: \"COVID-19 vaccines give instructions to teach our cells how to make a protein â€” or even just a piece of a protein â€” that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them. The immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.\" The   occurs \"in much the same manner that you make insulin or hemoglobin or myosin or any of the hundreds and hundreds of proteins that your body makes everyday,\" Offit said.Â  \"If I come and stand next to someone, Iâ€™m not going to catch their insulin,\" he said. \"Theyâ€™re not going to transfer insulin from them to me. Thatâ€™s the level of thinking.\" Some live-virus vaccines in history have \"shed\" the virus enough to affect others, including the oral polio vaccine and a rotavirus vaccine, experts said. The phenomenon â€” known as \"contact immunity\" â€” played a role in eradicating polio, because one childâ€™s vaccination could inoculate others indirectly. In rare cases, the oral polio vaccine could actually cause illness. But the oral polio vaccine has not been used in the U.S. for years, said Kelly L. Moore, deputy director at the Immunization Action Coalition. And none of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. are live-virus vaccines. PolitiFact previously   social media posts that claimed exposure to vaccinated people could trigger menstrual cycles and fertility problems in unvaccinated women, along with   that said the vaccines could cause death or disease in unvaccinated people by shedding. Further, there is \"absolutely no evidence whatsoever\" that the shots  ,   or menstrual irregularities in people who get inoculated themselves, Gohil said. The thinking for some of the false claims about fertility in particular is that the vaccines can stunt the recipientâ€™s ability to get pregnant, because the spike protein resembles a protein on placental cells, called syncytin-1. But the two proteins   to trick the immune system into attacking the placental cells. \"There isnâ€™t molecular mimicry,\" Offit said. If there was, then people infected with COVID-19 would have experienced the same problem, he said.Â  Offit pointed to the phase-three vaccine trials as evidence that they donâ€™t hinder pregnancies.Â  Pfizer and Moderna did not accept people who were pregnant into their trials, and they asked participants not to get pregnant, Offit said. But some women got pregnant anyway â€” 36 in total across the two trials, each of which enrolled more than 30,000 participants.Â  \"If it was true that the vaccine affected fertility, then all of those pregnancies should have been in the placebo group,\" he said. \"But they werenâ€™t. They were equally divided among the two groups, which is to say that the vaccines neither promoted nor negated your ability to get pregnant.\"Â  The trials didnâ€™t reveal concerns about the vaccinesâ€™ impact on menstruation, either, experts said. Some anecdotal reports of menstrual changes have since surfaced, but   has identified the shots as the direct cause. A womanâ€™s menstrual cycle can fluctuate due to several factors, including diet, stress, exercise, illness and pregnancy, according to the       about \"vaccine spreading\" appeared to accelerate on  ,   and   in mid April, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.

(AP/Long)\n","\n"," Medical experts and the CDC said itâ€™s not biologically possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to â€œshedâ€ or affect unvaccinated people, despite what anti-vaccine activists claim. The misinformation about â€œvaccine sheddingâ€ has had a real-world impact. One Miami private school recently instructed immunized teachers to stay away from students, citing the baseless claim that unvaccinated people can experience menstrual irregularities and other reproductive harm simply from interacting with vaccinated people. Â  In April, faculty and staff at a small Miami private school   telling them that if they chose to get the COVID-19 vaccine, they would have to keep their distance from the students. A week later, one fifth-grade student   home to her parents from the school. The teacher \"is telling us to stay away from you guys,\" the student wrote,    .Â  The episode at the Centner Academy is the latest example of online misinformation seeping into the real world. School co-founder Leila Centner framed the policy as a matter of protecting the unvaccinated people from \"being negatively impacted\" by those who got their COVID-19 shots.Â  \"We have at least three women with menstrual cycles impacted after having spent time with a vaccinated person,\" Centner said. The notion that the COVID-19 vaccines can be \"shed\" like the coronavirus itself \"is a conspiracy that has been created to weaken trust\" in the vaccines, said Christopher Zahn, vice president of practice activities at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The script-flipping narrative not only dissuades people from getting the vaccine, but also seeks to isolate or punish those who have. The misinformation has taken a hold anyway â€” well beyond one school in Miami.       vaccinated customers to stick to curbside pickup. And on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, users shared warnings that serious side effects, including menstrual irregularities and infertility, can come from contact with vaccinated people. PolitiFact talked to medical experts about what emerged in April as a prevailing narrative within the anti-vaccine community. The claims about \"vaccine shedding\" are not only false, but also biologically impossible given the construction of the COVID-19 vaccines.Â  \"There is absolutely no biological mechanism for any COVID-19 vaccine side effects or vaccine components to shed to others,\" said Dr. Shruti Gohil, the associate medical director for epidemiology and infection prevention at the University of California, Irvine. The notice sent out at Centner Academy stirred so much controversy that a reporter asked about it  . But the facts arenâ€™t up for debate. None of the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S. \"can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy,\" said Dr. Jennifer Gunter, a gynecologist who has written about the vaccines, in  . \"Let me be very clear. The COVID-19 vaccines cannot affect anyone by proxy.\" \"In fact, the opposite is true,\" added John Grabenstein, the associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition. \"By being vaccinated, one avoids being infected and so does not become a COVID-19 virus factory.\" The vaccines use different technologies to instruct cells to make versions of one spike protein found on the coronavirus, so the immune system can mount a response to it, said Dr. Paul A. Offit, chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Perelman School of Medicine. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses an adenovirus thatâ€™s been altered to make it harmless. In a statement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described the process this way: \"COVID-19 vaccines give instructions to teach our cells how to make a protein â€” or even just a piece of a protein â€” that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them. The immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.\" The   occurs \"in much the same manner that you make insulin or hemoglobin or myosin or any of the hundreds and hundreds of proteins that your body makes everyday,\" Offit said.Â  \"If I come and stand next to someone, Iâ€™m not going to catch their insulin,\" he said. \"Theyâ€™re not going to transfer insulin from them to me. Thatâ€™s the level of thinking.\" Some live-virus vaccines in history have \"shed\" the virus enough to affect others, including the oral polio vaccine and a rotavirus vaccine, experts said. The phenomenon â€” known as \"contact immunity\" â€” played a role in eradicating polio, because one childâ€™s vaccination could inoculate others indirectly. In rare cases, the oral polio vaccine could actually cause illness. But the oral polio vaccine has not been used in the U.S. for years, said Kelly L. Moore, deputy director at the Immunization Action Coalition. And none of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. are live-virus vaccines. PolitiFact previously   social media posts that claimed exposure to vaccinated people could trigger menstrual cycles and fertility problems in unvaccinated women, along with   that said the vaccines could cause death or disease in unvaccinated people by shedding. Further, there is \"absolutely no evidence whatsoever\" that the shots  ,   or menstrual irregularities in people who get inoculated themselves, Gohil said. The thinking for some of the false claims about fertility in particular is that the vaccines can stunt the recipientâ€™s ability to get pregnant, because the spike protein resembles a protein on placental cells, called syncytin-1. But the two proteins   to trick the immune system into attacking the placental cells. \"There isnâ€™t molecular mimicry,\" Offit said. If there was, then people infected with COVID-19 would have experienced the same problem, he said.Â  Offit pointed to the phase-three vaccine trials as evidence that they donâ€™t hinder pregnancies.Â  Pfizer and Moderna did not accept people who were pregnant into their trials, and they asked participants not to get pregnant, Offit said. But some women got pregnant anyway â€” 36 in total across the two trials, each of which enrolled more than 30,000 participants.Â  \"If it was true that the vaccine affected fertility, then all of those pregnancies should have been in the placebo group,\" he said. \"But they werenâ€™t. They were equally divided among the two groups, which is to say that the vaccines neither promoted nor negated your ability to get pregnant.\"Â  The trials didnâ€™t reveal concerns about the vaccinesâ€™ impact on menstruation, either, experts said. Some anecdotal reports of menstrual changes have since surfaced, but   has identified the shots as the direct cause. A womanâ€™s menstrual cycle can fluctuate due to several factors, including diet, stress, exercise, illness and pregnancy, according to the       about \"vaccine spreading\" appeared to accelerate on  ,   and   in mid April, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.

An Associated Press analysis of available government data from May shows that â€œbreakthroughâ€ infections in fully vaccinated people accounted for fewer than 1,200 of more than 107,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations. Thatâ€™s about 1.1%. And only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people. That translates to about 0.8%, or five deaths per day on average. The AP analyzed figures provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC itself has not estimated what percentage of hospitalizations and deaths are in fully vaccinated people, citing limitations in the data. Among them: Only about 45 states report breakthrough infections, and some are more aggressive than others in looking for such cases. So the data probably understates such infections, CDC officials said. Still, the overall trend that emerges from the data echoes what many health care authorities are seeing around the country and what top experts are saying.  Earlier this month, Andy Slavitt, a former adviser to the Biden administration on COVID-19, suggested that 98% to 99% of the Americans dying of the coronavirus are unvaccinated.  And CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Tuesday that the vaccine is so effective that â€œnearly every death, especially among adults, due to COVID-19, is, at this point, entirely preventable.â€ She called such deaths â€œparticularly tragic.â€ Deaths in the U.S. have plummeted from a peak of more than 3,400 day on average in mid-January, one month into the vaccination drive. About 63% of all vaccine-eligible Americans â€” those 12 and older â€” have received at least one dose, and 53% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. While vaccine remains scarce in much of the world, the U.S. supply is so abundant and demand has slumped so dramatically that shots sit unused. Ross Bagne, a 68-year-old small-business owner in Cheyenne, Wyoming, was eligible for the vaccine in early February but didnâ€™t get it. He died June 4, infected and unvaccinated, after spending more than three weeks in the hospital, his lungs filling with fluid. He was unable to swallow because of a stroke. â€œHe never went out, so he didnâ€™t think he would catch it,â€ said his grieving sister, Karen McKnight. She wondered: â€œWhy take the risk of not getting vaccinated?â€ The preventable deaths will continue, experts predict, with unvaccinated pockets of the nation experiencing outbreaks in the fall and winter. Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, said modeling suggests the nation will hit 1,000 deaths per day again next year. In Arkansas, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, with only about 33% of the population fully protected, cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rising.  â€œIt is sad to see someone go to the hospital or die when it can be prevented,â€ Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted as he urged people to get their shots. In Seattleâ€™s King County, the public health department found only three deaths during a recent 60-day period in people who were fully vaccinated. The rest, some 95% of 62 deaths, had had no vaccine or just one shot. â€œThose are all somebodyâ€™s parents, grandparents, siblings and friends,â€ said Dr. Mark Del Beccaro, who helps lead a vaccination outreach program in King County. â€œItâ€™s still a lot of deaths, and theyâ€™re preventable deaths.â€ In the St. Louis area, more than 90% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have not been vaccinated, said Dr. Alex Garza, a hospital administrator who directs a metropolitan-area task force on the outbreak. â€œThe majority of them express some regret for not being vaccinated,â€ Garza said. â€œThatâ€™s a pretty common refrain that weâ€™re hearing from patients with COVID.â€ The stories of unvaccinated people dying may convince some people they should get the shots, but young adults â€” the group least likely to be vaccinated â€” may be motivated more by a desire to protect their loved ones, said David Michaels, an epidemiologist at George Washington Universityâ€™s school of public health in the nationâ€™s capital. Others need paid time off to get the shots and deal with any side effects, Michaels said. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration this month began requiring health care employers, including hospitals and nursing homes, to provide such time off.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorizations for three COVID-19 vaccines for use in the United States.* In large, randomized-controlled trials, each vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 ( â€“ ). Despite the high level of vaccine efficacy, a small percentage of fully vaccinated persons (i.e. received all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine) will develop symptomatic or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 ( â€“ ). CDC is working with state and territorial health departments to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infections among persons who are fully vaccinated and to monitor trends in case characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 variants identified from persons with these infections. For this surveillance, a vaccine breakthrough infection is defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a respiratory specimen collected from a person â‰¥14 days after receipt of all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. State health departments voluntarily report vaccine breakthrough infections to CDC.  When possible, genomic sequencing is performed on respiratory specimens that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA ( ). A total of 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported from 46 U.S. states and territories as of April 30, 2021. Among these cases, 6,446 (63%) occurred in females, and the median patient age was 58 years (interquartile rangeÂ =Â 40â€“74 years). Based on preliminary data, 2,725 (27%) vaccine breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, 995 (10%) patients were known to be hospitalized, and 160 (2%) patients died. Among the 995 hospitalized patients, 289 (29%) were asymptomatic or hospitalized for a reason unrelated to COVID-19. The median age of patients who died was 82 years (interquartile rangeÂ =Â 71â€“89 years); 28 (18%) decedents were asymptomatic or died from a cause unrelated to COVID-19. Sequence data were available from 555 (5%) reported cases, 356 (64%) of which were identified as SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,  including B.1.1.7 (199; 56%), B.1.429 (88; 25%), B.1.427 (28; 8%), P.1 (28; 8%), and B.1.351 (13; 4%). As of April 30, 2021, approximately 101 million persons in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  However, during the surveillance period, SARS-CoV-2 transmission continued at high levels in many parts of the country, with approximately 355,000 COVID-19 cases reported nationally during the week of April 24â€“30, 2021.** Even though FDA-authorized vaccines are highly effective, breakthrough cases are expected, especially before population immunity reaches sufficient levels to further decrease transmission. However, vaccine breakthrough infections occur in only a small fraction of all vaccinated persons and account for a small percentage of all COVID-19 cases ( â€“ ). The number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths that will be prevented among vaccinated persons will far exceed the number of vaccine breakthrough cases. To date, the age and sex distribution of reported vaccine breakthrough infections reflects the fully vaccinated U.S. population.  The proportion of reported vaccine breakthrough infections attributed to variants of concern has also been similar to the proportion of these variants circulating throughout the United States. During March 28â€“April 10, 2021, the aforementioned variants of concern accounted for 70% of the weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 lineages submitted to CDCâ€™s national genomic surveillance. The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the number of reported COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases is likely a substantial undercount of all SARS-CoV-2 infections among fully vaccinated persons. The national surveillance system relies on passive and voluntary reporting, and data might not be complete or representative. Many persons with vaccine breakthrough infections, especially those who are asymptomatic or who experience mild illness, might not seek testing. Second, SARS-CoV-2 sequence data are available for only a small proportion of the reported cases. Beginning May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections to investigating only those among patients who are hospitalized or die, thereby focusing on the cases of highest clinical and public health significance. CDC will continue to lead studies in multiple U.S. sites to evaluate vaccine effectiveness and collect information on all COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections regardless of clinical status. Additional information and resources to help public health departments and laboratories investigate and report COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases are available at  . FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective ( â€“ ). CDC recommends that all persons aged â‰¥12 years be vaccinated with an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine  ( ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorizations for three COVID-19 vaccines for use in the United States.* In large, randomized-controlled trials, each vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 ( â€“ ). Despite the high level of vaccine efficacy, a small percentage of fully vaccinated persons (i.e. received all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine) will develop symptomatic or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 ( â€“ ).

And ABCNews.com.co. Even 24wpn.com has an official ring to it. But all of these websites peddle bogus stories, either by making up fake news or sharing it from other sources. And itâ€™s not always apparent to readers thatâ€™s the case. Since December, we at PolitiFact have been partnering with Facebook to  . As of April 19, weâ€™ve written more than   stories. Weâ€™ve  , chief among them that it can be really difficult for readers â€” from casual skimmers to seasoned newshounds â€” to spot fake news outlets when they pop up. Itâ€™s also difficult to determine where these fictional stories come from, and just how they spread across the Internet. Using our experiences, we've been able to create our own fake news almanac. We want to help readers sort out fact from fiction on your social news feeds, so we compiled a list of every website on which weâ€™ve found deliberately false or fake news stories since we started working along with Facebook â€” to 330 in all. (This list was last updatedÂ Nov. 9, 2017, and is no longer updated.)Â  This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it necessarily mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites  , and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one. Some websites just want you to click on their pages to generate advertising revenue. Others, it appears, want to reinforce fiercely held political views. And some regular websites apparently get duped by fake news articles, the same as readers. Weâ€™ve broken the websites on our list down into four broad categories, marked by specific aims and methods for generating or sharing fake news. Letâ€™s take a closer look at all four and how they operate. Many of the deliberately false or fake news stories we see in social media feeds begin on websites that attempt to parody real news â€” imagine the humor website The Onion, but without the name recognition (or often the comedic writing talent). It can be difficult to parse what the aims of these parody sites may be. They could be writing stories purely for entertainment, or they may be trolling a particular set of voters. These websites may or may not make it clear on individual links that their stories are fake, but will almost always say in a disclaimer somewhere on their site that their content is exaggerated or fictional. For example,   on a website called Politicono.com carried the headline, \"Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because â€˜Santa Was Always White In The Bible.â€™\" This story referred to a factual development: Minnesotaâ€™s Mall of America hiring its  . But then it quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America \"into the ground,\" on the basis of Santa \"always having been white in the Bible,\" and, \"No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong.\" The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things. We rated the claim  ! If you look closely enough, Politicono.com admits it makes things up. The site   a \"hybrid news/satire platform,\" taking real news hooks and building fake stories on top of them. Every article has a \"show facts\" button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated. Only the first paragraph about the mall hiring an African-American Santa Claus is real. (Palin was   about the parody.) Politicono.com is not alone. It is part of an entire family of similar websites under the Newslo.com umbrella. Similar urls share reports like this one, including websites like Politicalo.com, Politicot.com, Religionlo.com and Politicops.com. These are all registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who told us he creates sites for clients, but wouldnâ€™t give us much more information than that. Newslo.com is registered in Thessaloniki, Greece, but most of the sister sites belong to an address in Jerusalem. Being able to identify Sompo as the administrator is an exception, because learning who owns and operates these websites can be exasperatingly difficult. We can look up the owner of any website, but if the buyer has used a proxy service of some kind to buy the domain, there are precious few details about the true owner, or even from which country the site is operated. That is especially true in the case of our next couple of categories. Adding to the fog of fake news online, several websites appear to try to confuse readers into thinking they are the online outlets of traditional or mainstream media sources. These sites attempt to trick readers into thinking they are newspapers or radio or television stations. Like many other fake news sites, itâ€™s very difficult to see who owns them, thanks to private registrations. We did see that some sites were based in far-flung global locations like Macedonia and Chile. But most imposters weâ€™ve found so far have set up shop anonymously through domain services like GoDaddy.com. One such site, CNNews3.com, not only usedÂ a web address similar to CNN, but its graphics also deliberately looked almost the same. The   that carried the headline, \"HIV virus detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus.\" (The website was recently taken down, but there's an  .)Â  For the record, HIV canâ€™t survive outside the human body, so itâ€™s not possible for the virus to live in a fruit like a banana. The CNNews3.com story tries to cast doubt on this by noting researchers were puzzled by the banana-borne infections. We learned this story wasÂ a variation of other fake stories of disease-ridden fruit, and this one sprung from a Facebook user posting photos of a malady called mokillo. Mokillo is more colorfully known as  , and can be a  . The disease doesnâ€™t harm humans, but it does require banana growers to disinfect farming equipment. We rated that statement  ! But while that story looked to instill fear to generate shares and clicks, some imposter websites appear to bank more on readers zeroing in on things they want to hear more about. We found an entire family of sites that created different versions of posts keyed to town names, apparently to generate advertising revenue. These sites have official-sounding names like  ,  ,   and more, posting various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. These posts, with only slight variations in details, say a   in a particular place, that a   to a certain town or, say, that the   nearby. The bulk of fake news websites, however, end up peddling their wares in a much more insidious manner. There's little consistency of content or style among fake news sites â€” the common thread appears to be that they distribute fabricated content, but the reasons arenâ€™t always apparent. We have found that almost all of them share or reblog a good deal of content from other sites, either with or without attribution, and much of it is from the sites in the first two categories. They also can potentially create their own false stories, or distribute larger conspiracy theories. These sites can be based anywhere. While many of them mask their registry information, weâ€™ve found outlets based across the United States, but also in Canada, Georgia, Ghana, Sri Lanka and, as previously mentioned, Macedonia â€” a country where teenagers turned fake news into a   during the 2016 election. One website weâ€™ve written about was UndergroundNewsReport.com, a fake news site that was  . James McDaniel of Clearwater, Fla., wanted to fool Donald Trumpâ€™s supporters, so he attempted to cook up the most outrageous manufactured headlines he could think up. Instead of fading away into obscurity, the site gained 1 million views in less than two weeks. McDaniel eventually shut the site down once a   drew too much ire from readers who were fooled. Another prime example of a story that spread across fake news sites was one that said \"first grandma\" Marian Robinson will be getting a $160,000 annual pension after President Barack Obama and his family moved out of the White House. Bloggers on the websites USPostman.com and ENHLive.com both posted articles around December 2016 that said Robinson will get paid the money for \"services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver\" for watching granddaughters Sasha and Malia. Of course, there are no such provisions for a first grandmother, and Robinson received nothing. We rated it  ! The original story appeared on BostonTribune.com, a parody site that no longer appears to be working, and found its way to other sites. The migration shows how joke stories can cause harm even if they are originally labeled as fabricated. Other websites steal them to grind out page views, omitting indications the stories are made up. Most of these sites join services like   or   that allow them to post a collection of provocative ads to make money off clicks. All the sites really need is content to keep the page views rolling in. While elaborate conspiracy theories and mindless clickbait show up on the pages, completely made up posts work just as well. A bogus story like the one concerning Robinson highlighted several ingredients essential to making a fake news story draw readers and go viral: Outrageous claims, partisan rancor, government mechanisms, tax money and the presidentâ€™s family (President Barack Obama, in this case). Fake news doesnâ€™t easily die, either, instead morphing into new stories and propagating its own lies. Many websites later ran a follow-up about Robinson originally posted on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, an outlet that started as an elaborate ruse in which liberals trolled conservatives with wild, made-up posts looking to inflame the political right. Fake news sites have flocked to TheLastLineOfDefense.org, appropriating its stories to serve as repurposed content. One story said Robinson was arrested and charged with larceny and fraud for attempting to collect the mythical pension propagated by BostonTribune.com. That story  , for the record. Finally, some websites appear to get duped like the rest of us. We have checked statements from sites that appear to carry real content, but contained one or more fake news stories. We donâ€™t know whether this is intentional or accidental, but it happens. One statement we checked was a   on UrbanImageMagazine.com, a lifestyle and culture website, that declared that \"300,000 pounds of rat meat sold as chicken wings across America.\" We        . The fake story said the Food and Drug Administration was issuing a warning about rodents being sold as chicken wings after several shipping containers of rat meat were impounded coming into San Francisco from China. The rat meat was allegedly filtering into the food system to deal with a shortage of poultry leading up to the Super Bowl. We rated the statement  ! UrbanImageMagazine.com later told us they \"had no idea\" the story was fake. The story actually came from WorldNewsDailyReport.net, a known peddler of fake articles. The site  , referring to \"the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\" Sometimes itâ€™s not even the editors of a site that are reposting the fake stuff. Outlets with user-generated content often fall victim, as well. An example is a post  , headlined \"Jimmy Carter: â€˜Medical marijuana cured my cancer,â€™ \" from CannaSOS.com. The site says it is a social media platform where \"cannabis enthusiasts\" can discuss information related to marijuana. The story said Carter credited marijuana for curing his cancer, but the fake story appears to have originated from   on a site called SatiraTribune.com. The post even credited the opening line from The Toyesâ€™ 1983 weed anthem \" \" to Carter. Thereâ€™s no disclaimer on the site, but their   that SatiraTribune.com publishes \"satirical and futuristic news.\" We rated this one  ! We had asked CannaSOS.com if they had been aware the story was fiction. An administrator eventually told us that the post was a reader submission, and they were aware it was fake. But as of this writing, both the CannaSOS.com and UrbanImageMagazine.com posts are still online.

One statement we checked was a   on UrbanImageMagazine.com, a lifestyle and culture website, that declared that \"300,000 pounds of rat meat sold as chicken wings across America.\" We        . The fake story said the Food and Drug Administration was issuing a warning about rodents being sold as chicken wings after several shipping containers of rat meat were impounded coming into San Francisco from China. The rat meat was allegedly filtering into the food system to deal with a shortage of poultry leading up to the Super Bowl. We rated the statement  ! UrbanImageMagazine.com later told us they \"had no idea\" the story was fake. The story actually came from WorldNewsDailyReport.net, a known peddler of fake articles. The site  , referring to \"the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\" Sometimes itâ€™s not even the editors of a site that are reposting the fake stuff. Outlets with user-generated content often fall victim, as well. An example is a post  , headlined \"Jimmy Carter: â€˜Medical marijuana cured my cancer,â€™ \" from CannaSOS.com. The site says it is a social media platform where \"cannabis enthusiasts\" can discuss information related to marijuana. The story said Carter credited marijuana for curing his cancer, but the fake story appears to have originated from   on a site called SatiraTribune.com. The post even credited the opening line from The Toyesâ€™ 1983 weed anthem \" \" to Carter. Thereâ€™s no disclaimer on the site, but their   that SatiraTribune.com publishes \"satirical and futuristic news.\" We rated this one  ! We had asked CannaSOS.com if they had been aware the story was fiction. An administrator eventually told us that the post was a reader submission, and they were aware it was fake. But as of this writing, both the CannaSOS.com and UrbanImageMagazine.com posts are still online.

Facing criticism for furloughing workers after it was granted $25 million in federal coronavirus relief funding, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday defended its need for the bailout and outlined its plans for the money. The Kennedy Center in Washington, home of the National Symphony Orchestra and the Washington National Opera, painted a dire picture of the pandemicâ€™s economic impact,   that even with the extra funding, the center would run out of cash as soon as July. The center announced Tuesday that it would need to furlough around 250 people, roughly 60 percent of its full-time administrative staff, in addition to more than 700 hourly and part-time employees. â€œIt is imperative that we scale back the entire institutionâ€™s personnel costs during this time of closure and dearth of ticket income,â€ said a statement from the center, which canceled performances through at least May 10 but predicted that projected reopening date might be premature. The defense came as some Republican legislators introduced a bill to revoke the   for the Kennedy Center in the   that President Trump signed into law on Friday. Some Republicans have made funding for the Kennedy Center a symbol of what they deemed wasteful spending on the part of Democrats. Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio,   that the Kennedy Center was a â€œnice placeâ€ but did not deserve to get funding through legislation focused primarily on helping businesses and families in need. Democrats had defended the funding, saying the Kennedy Center, which was first established as the National Cultural Center in legislation passed by Congress in 1958  provides employment for nearly 3,000 people who would be risking losses as the performing arts center canceled shows and lost revenue. Even President Trump, in a break with some members of his party, voiced support for the funding, saying at a news conference that heâ€™d â€œlove to see â€˜Romeo and Julietâ€™â€ at the Kennedy Center but that â€œyou couldnâ€™t go there if you wanted to.â€ But pressure on the center has grown as it has announced the furloughs despite the infusion of federal aid. The Kennedy Center notified leaders of the National Symphony Orchestra that 96 musicians were being furloughed and would receive their final paychecks this week, prompting a pushback Tuesday from their union, the D.C. Federation of Musicians. Lawyers representing the union sent a letter to a Kennedy Center lawyer arguing that the decision to stop paying musicians after this week was a violation of their collective bargaining agreement and that the center should have provided six weeksâ€™ notice to the musicians. According to the letter, the Kennedy Center had argued it could suspend the agreement on one weekâ€™s notice because of â€œexigent circumstances.â€ On Tuesday, Representative Bryan Steil, a Republican from Wisconsin,   that would rescind the $25 million in funding, saying in a statement, â€œif an organization is receiving assistance from the federal government, we expect them to take care of their workers.â€ In the numbers it released on Tuesday, the Kennedy Center said that the majority of the funding it received â€” $22 million out of the $25 million â€” would be designated for employee compensation, benefits and artist contracts and fees. The rest of the money would go toward a deep cleaning of the facility, IT help for its new tele-working system, rent and other expenses. A spokeswoman for the center said it will pay for health care benefits for employees who are furloughed. Arts institutions across the country are experiencing financial struggles like those of the Kennedy Center, which said it relies on ticket sales and donations for most of its operating budget. The â€œskeleton staffâ€ of roughly 150 people the center said would keep their positions include employees in finance, marketing, development and the box office. In addition to the musicians, furloughed staff members include ushers as well as workers in concessions, parking and retail.

Titles I, II, III, and V of the original law   are codified in Title 42, chapter 126, of the United States Code beginning at   section 12101.  Title IV of the original   law is codified in Title 47, chapter 5, of the United States Code.  Since this codification resulted in   changes in the numbering system, the Table of Contents provides the section   numbers of the ADA   as originally enacted in brackets after the codified section numbers   and headings.  \n"," Â  TITLE 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE CHAPTER 126 - EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES       .         \n","     \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n","     \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   ] \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n"," SUBCHAPTER II - PUBLIC SERVICES [Title II] \n"," PART A - Prohibition Against Discrimination and Other Generally Applicable Provisions [Subtitle A] \n","   \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," PART B - Actions Applicable to Public Transportation Provided by Public Entities Considered Discriminatory [Subtitle B] \n"," SUBPART I - Public Transportation Other Than by Aircraft or Certain Rail Operations [Part I] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","  SUBPART II - Public Transportation by Intercity and Commuter Rail [Part II] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   . \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," SUBCHAPTER IV MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS [Title V] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","     \n","     \n","     \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   . \n","   \n","   \n"," TITLE 47 - TELEGRAPHS, TELEPHONES, AND RADIOTELEGRAPHS  \n"," CHAPTER 5 - WIRE OR RADIO COMMUNICATION .  \n"," SUBCHAPTER II - COMMON CARRIERS   \n"," Part I - Common Carrier Regulation  \n"," \n","   \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," TITLE 47 - TELEGRAPHS, TELEPHONES, AND RADIOTELEGRAPHS  \n"," CHAPTER 5 - WIRE OR RADIO COMMUNICATION . \n"," SUBCHAPTER VI - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS   \n"," \n"," Â  \n"," TITLE 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE \n"," CHAPTER 126 - EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES \n","   \n","   (a) Findings \n","  The Congress finds that \n"," (1) physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination; others who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability also have been subjected to discrimination;  \n"," (2) historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem; \n"," (3) discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services; \n"," (4) unlike individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination; \n"," (5) individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities; \n"," (6) census data, national polls, and other studies have documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally; \n"," (7) the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and \n"," (8) the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous, and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity. \n","   (b) Purpose \n","  It is the purpose of this chapter \n"," (1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities; \n","  (2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities; \n"," (3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities; and \n"," (4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities. \n"," Sec. 12101 note: Findings and Purposes of ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-325, Â§Â 2, Sept. 25, 2008, 122 Stat. 3553, provided that:  \n"," (a) Findings \n"," Congress finds that- \n"," (1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Congress intended that the Act \"provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities\" and provide broad coverage; \n"," (2) in enacting the ADA, Congress recognized that physical and mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, but that people with physical or mental disabilities are frequently precluded from doing so because of prejudice, antiquated attitudes, or the failure to remove societal and institutional barriers; \n"," (3) while Congress expected that the definition of disability under the ADA would be interpreted consistently with how courts had applied the definition of a handicapped individual under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that expectation has not been fulfilled; \n"," (4) the holdings of the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom Congress intended to protect; \n"," (5) the holding of the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) further narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA; \n"," (6) as a result of these Supreme Court cases, lower courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with disabilities; \n"," (7) in particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), interpreted the term \"substantially limits\" to require a greater degree of limitation than was intended by Congress; and \n"," (8) Congress finds that the current Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ADA regulations defining the term \"substantially limits\" as \"significantly restricted\" are inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too high a standard. \n"," (b) Purposes \n"," The purposes of this Act are- \n"," (1) to carry out the ADA's objectives of providing \"a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination\" and \"clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination\" by reinstating a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA; \n"," (2) to reject the requirement enunciated by the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures;  \n"," (3) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) with regard to coverage under the third prong of the definition of disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; \n"," (4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms \"substantially\" and \"major\" in the definition of disability under the ADA \"need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled,\" and that to be substantially limited in performing a major life activity under the ADA \"an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives\"; \n"," (5) to convey congressional intent that the standard created by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) for \"substantially limits\", and applied by lower courts in numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA, to convey that it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations, and to convey that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis; and  \n"," (6) to express Congress' expectation that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will revise that portion of its current regulations that defines the term \"substantially limits\" as \"significantly restricted\" to be consistent with this Act, including the amendments made by this Act. \n","   Sec. 12102.

The ADA was originally enacted in public law format   and later rearranged and published in the United States Code.  The United States Code is divided into titles   and chapters that classify laws according to their subject matter.  Titles I, II, III, and V of the original law   are codified in Title 42, chapter 126, of the United States Code beginning at   section 12101.  Title IV of the original   law is codified in Title 47, chapter 5, of the United States Code.  Since this codification resulted in   changes in the numbering system, the Table of Contents provides the section   numbers of the ADA   as originally enacted in brackets after the codified section numbers   and headings.  \n"," Â  TITLE 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE CHAPTER 126 - EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES       .         \n","     \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n","     \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   ] \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n"," SUBCHAPTER II - PUBLIC SERVICES [Title II] \n"," PART A - Prohibition Against Discrimination and Other Generally Applicable Provisions [Subtitle A] \n","   \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," PART B - Actions Applicable to Public Transportation Provided by Public Entities Considered Discriminatory [Subtitle B] \n"," SUBPART I - Public Transportation Other Than by Aircraft or Certain Rail Operations [Part I] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","  SUBPART II - Public Transportation by Intercity and Commuter Rail [Part II] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   . \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," SUBCHAPTER IV MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS [Title V] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","     \n","     \n","     \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n"," \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   ] \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   \n","   . \n","   \n","   \n"," TITLE 47 - TELEGRAPHS, TELEPHONES, AND RADIOTELEGRAPHS  \n"," CHAPTER 5 - WIRE OR RADIO COMMUNICATION .  \n"," SUBCHAPTER II - COMMON CARRIERS   \n"," Part I - Common Carrier Regulation  \n"," \n","   \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," TITLE 47 - TELEGRAPHS, TELEPHONES, AND RADIOTELEGRAPHS  \n"," CHAPTER 5 - WIRE OR RADIO COMMUNICATION . \n"," SUBCHAPTER VI - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS   \n"," \n"," Â  \n"," TITLE 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE \n"," CHAPTER 126 - EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES \n","   \n","   (a) Findings \n","  The Congress finds that \n"," (1) physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination; others who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability also have been subjected to discrimination;  \n"," (2) historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem; \n"," (3) discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services; \n"," (4) unlike individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination; \n"," (5) individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities; \n"," (6) census data, national polls, and other studies have documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally; \n"," (7) the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and \n"," (8) the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous, and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity. \n","   (b) Purpose \n","  It is the purpose of this chapter \n"," (1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities; \n","  (2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities; \n"," (3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities; and \n"," (4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities. \n"," Sec. 12101 note: Findings and Purposes of ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.

United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom Congress intended to protect; \n"," (5) the holding of the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) further narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA; \n"," (6) as a result of these Supreme Court cases, lower courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with disabilities; \n"," (7) in particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), interpreted the term \"substantially limits\" to require a greater degree of limitation than was intended by Congress; and \n"," (8) Congress finds that the current Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ADA regulations defining the term \"substantially limits\" as \"significantly restricted\" are inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too high a standard. \n"," (b) Purposes \n"," The purposes of this Act are- \n"," (1) to carry out the ADA's objectives of providing \"a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination\" and \"clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination\" by reinstating a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA; \n"," (2) to reject the requirement enunciated by the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures;  \n"," (3) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) with regard to coverage under the third prong of the definition of disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; \n"," (4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms \"substantially\" and \"major\" in the definition of disability under the ADA \"need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled,\" and that to be substantially limited in performing a major life activity under the ADA \"an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives\"; \n"," (5) to convey congressional intent that the standard created by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) for \"substantially limits\", and applied by lower courts in numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA, to convey that it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations, and to convey that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis; and  \n"," (6) to express Congress' expectation that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will revise that portion of its current regulations that defines the term \"substantially limits\" as \"significantly restricted\" to be consistent with this Act, including the amendments made by this Act. \n","   Sec. 12102.

The post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about .)Â  Medical masks, like the N95, offer the most protection, but experts widely agree that several types of facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, are effective at slowing virus spread.Â  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   deterred people from wearing face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. But that guidance changed on April 3, after studies found that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, or before symptoms start to show. Now,   that   wear a facial covering in public and in areas where social distancing isnâ€™t possible. Officials say the most effective homemade masks should fit snugly and be made of thick cloth. A comparison between masks is flawed for a couple of reasons.Â  First, the N95, and other medical masks, are in high demand and officials say they should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients.Â  Second, multiple studies that look at the efficacy of lower-grade fabric masks have shown that they, too, help block particles.Â  \"The protection from cloth masks isnâ€™t 0, and itâ€™s definitely not 100, but the way to think about any of the masks and our overall approach is how do you put together all the pieces of the puzzle to give you a complete picture of minimizing the risk of transmission of COVID-19?\" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvardâ€™s school of public health. \"Hand washing, wearing masks, and social distancing is part of it, but none of them alone. Itâ€™s how you put together these different tools to meet the task at hand. Wearing any mask is a very, very small price to pay to be safe and return to society.\" Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, told PolitiFact that masks provide some protection but the amount can vary widely depending on the type and how it's worn. Masks reduce the amount of virus spread and also the amount one might inhale, she said.Â  Itâ€™s not true, she said, that cloth masks provide 0% protection. \"There have been measurements showing that homemade mask materials offer up to 80% protection,\" Marr said, \"which is much better than 0%, although not as good as an N95. Still, reducing the amount of virus that we inhale by 80% is better than nothing.\" A smattering of studies have looked at the efficacy of different masks in different ways.  used lasers to illuminate and measure how many droplets of saliva were released into the air by a person talking with and without a cloth facial covering.Â  As can be seen   of the experiment, a cluster of droplets appear in the air when the researcher speaks without a mask, but nearly all the particles are blocked when he does the same with a mask. The study   micro-droplets, and more research needs to be done on how many viral particles these smaller droplets can contain, but it demonstrated that a cloth mask is better than no mask. Scientists from the University of Hong Kongâ€™s School of Public Health conducted   in patients with seasonal coronaviruses. The report found that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in respiratory droplets.  mathematicians recently developed a model for assessing the community impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public. That study found that a broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks \"may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths,\" and said masks are useful to both prevent illness in healthy persons and prevent asymptomatic transmission. \"Typical protection (of fabric masks) is probably at least 50%, high quality masks could be 80â€“95% protective, and even low quality masks made of very thin materials could still be 10â€“20% protective,\" said Steffen Eikenberry, a postdoctoral scholar in the school of mathematical and statistical sciences and one of the main authors of the study. \"While evidence is still very limited, several laboratory studies indicate that the majority of homemade mask materials, including cotton fabric, cotton T-shirts, tea cloth, flannel, silk, linen, scarves, and chiffon offer at least 50% protection. Higher quality, more tightly woven fabrics are better, and multiple layers improves protection.\" Jeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco,   in favor of universal mask wearing. Howard says that researchers were looking at the wrong question at first â€“ how well a mask protects the wearer from infection â€“ and not how well a mask prevents an infected person from spreading the virus. He said masks function very differently as personal protective equipment versus \"source control.\" \"Masks are very good at blocking larger droplets and not nearly as good at blocking tiny particles,\" he wrote. \"When a person expels droplets into the air, they quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles called droplet nuclei. These are extremely hard to remove from the air. However, in the moist atmosphere between a personâ€™s mouth and their mask, it takes nearly a hundred times as long for a droplet to evaporate and shrink into a droplet nuclei.\" He continued: \"This means that nearly any kind of simple cloth mask is great for source control. The mask creates humidity, this humidity prevents virus-containing droplets from turning into droplet nuclei, and this allows the fabric of the mask to block the droplets.\" Social media posts claim that certain face masks are ineffective and provide \"0% protection.\" More research needs to be done but we found that medical experts widely refute the claim. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snuggly and are made of multiple layers.

But that patent is related toÂ aÂ form of coronavirus that could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent diseases in birds and other animals.Â Pirbright scientists do not currently work on any human coronaviruses.â€‹ \"There are no vaccines available for any coronaviruses let alone the (Wuhan) one,\" Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Universityâ€™s Center for Health Security,   PolitiFact. This claim is fabricated.  published Jan. 23, a website called Twisted Truth wrote that the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency had called on President Donald Trump to impose martial law in the United States,   transfer power to the military.Â  \"Acting FEMA Director Pete Gaynor on Wednesday offered President Trump a startling solution, Martial Law in the United States, to prevent the spread of a lethal Chinese Coronavirus that infected hundreds and killed at least 17 people in the Communist nation,\" the article reads. The story has been shared more than 570 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool. Twisted Truth also published   that has more than 5,000 views. The claim has been amplified by QAnon conspiracy theorists in   and   on 8kun (formerly 8chan), a fringe internet forum that was   after it was linked to mass shootings in New Zealand and the U.S. \"Itâ€™s not true â€” the FEMA director did not advise martial law,\" Lizzie Litzow, press secretary at FEMA, told PolitiFact.

The allegations were circulated widely in QAnon and other conspiracy Facebook groups and pages, as well as on 4chan, a fringe internet forum where several high-profile conspiracies  . But this claim takes unrelated events and financial connections out of context and morphs them into an inaccurate narrative about the coronavirus. As evidence, those posts point to financial ties between the Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom-based Pirbright Institute, as well as an event held Oct. 18, 2019. \"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the World Economic Forum co-hosted an event in NYC where â€˜policymakers, business leaders, and health officialsâ€™ worked together on a simulated coronavirus outbreak,\" reads   published by a website called IntelliHub.

Misinformation about the coronavirus has particularly taken root in Facebook groups for anti-vaccine advocates and believers in QAnon,  . Many of the posts about coronavirus were flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

If you see suspect claims on your social media feeds, you can send them to   and weâ€™ll check it out. This claim is inaccurate â€”Â   a similar statement Pants on Fire!Â  Several    ,  ,   and   allege that a vaccine developed for the coronavirus just as it started to spread earlier this month. Those claims were widely shared in anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, where some users said the disease could be a government plot to vaccinate more people. \"The Coronavirus PATENT is owned by the Pirbright Institute,\" said Shiva Ayyadurai, a Republican running for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts,  . Ayyadurai   with a variety of conspiracy theorists and right-wing provocateurs. As evidence, the posts link to pages for a patent on   and  . But that patent is related toÂ aÂ form of coronavirus that could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent diseases in birds and other animals.Â Pirbright scientists do not currently work on any human coronaviruses.â€‹ \"There are no vaccines available for any coronaviruses let alone the (Wuhan) one,\" Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Universityâ€™s Center for Health Security,   PolitiFact. This claim is fabricated.  published Jan. 23, a website called Twisted Truth wrote that the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency had called on President Donald Trump to impose martial law in the United States,   transfer power to the military.Â  \"Acting FEMA Director Pete Gaynor on Wednesday offered President Trump a startling solution, Martial Law in the United States, to prevent the spread of a lethal Chinese Coronavirus that infected hundreds and killed at least 17 people in the Communist nation,\" the article reads. The story has been shared more than 570 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool. Twisted Truth also published   that has more than 5,000 views. The claim has been amplified by QAnon conspiracy theorists in   and   on 8kun (formerly 8chan), a fringe internet forum that was   after it was linked to mass shootings in New Zealand and the U.S. \"Itâ€™s not true â€” the FEMA director did not advise martial law,\" Lizzie Litzow, press secretary at FEMA, told PolitiFact. Several    ,   and   claim that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation predicted, and are somehow profiting from, the coronavirus outbreak. The allegations were circulated widely in QAnon and other conspiracy Facebook groups and pages, as well as on 4chan, a fringe internet forum where several high-profile conspiracies  . But this claim takes unrelated events and financial connections out of context and morphs them into an inaccurate narrative about the coronavirus. As evidence, those posts point to financial ties between the Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom-based Pirbright Institute, as well as an event held Oct. 18, 2019. \"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the World Economic Forum co-hosted an event in NYC where â€˜policymakers, business leaders, and health officialsâ€™ worked together on a simulated coronavirus outbreak,\" reads   published by a website called IntelliHub.

The Pirbright Institute owns a patent for aÂ form of coronavirus that could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent diseases in animals.Â Pirbright scientists do not currently work on human coronaviruses like the Wuhan strain. But those disparate facts donâ€™t prove that the Gates Foundation has somehow profited from the most recent outbreak of the coronavirus. If anything, they show that the foundation has funded organizations that work to prevent epidemics. These claims are baseless â€”Â and they conflate COVID-19Â with other strains of the illness. Our friends at Factcheck.org and Health Feedback debunked similar    .  and   have said that COVID-19 was created in a lab, with some going as far as to say that the illness is a \"bioweapon for population control.\"   created by David Zublick, who has   of propagating conspiracies, has more than 12,000 views on YouTube. \"Several news websites, especially alternative news and health websites, are coming under cyberattack for reporting what is a huge story about the fact that this coronavirus that is sweeping China, and which has now spread to other countries â€” including the United States of America â€” is actually a biological attack being perpetrated on the United States and other countries,\" he said in the video. There is no evidence to support that claim. While its investigation is still ongoing, the CDC   the coronavirus appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. From there,   via travelers to several Asian countries, France and the United States. This claim is False â€”Â it comes from a blog with   of publishing false information. Zero Hedge said in   that the coronavirus is part of a Chinese plot to develop a bioweapon.

In 2013, researchers there   a new cluster of coronavirus infections that appeared to have originated in Saudi Arabia.Â  Great Game India implies that disease is the same one thatâ€™s currently affecting China. But the lab was examining the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. The CDC and the World Health Organization are still investigating the cause of the coronavirus outbreak.Â  . This claim is False â€”Â it comes from a website with ties to Steve Bannon and a Chinese billionaire.  published Jan. 25, G News wrote that Chinese Communist Party officials would soon \"admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from â€˜a lab in Wuhan (China)â€™ linked to its covert biological weapon programs.\" \"A reliable source told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an â€˜accidentalâ€™ leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on â€˜human errors,â€™\" the article reads. \"But the official announcement is still being finalized.\" While we canâ€™t know who G News has or hasnâ€™t spoken to, we could find no evidence to support the websiteâ€™s story.Â  No other media reports corroborate G Newsâ€™ story about the source of the coronavirus. There is a lab near Wuhan   with dangerous pathogens â€” and some   it to Chinaâ€™s biological warfare program. But officials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak. Miles Guo, also known as Guo Wengui, is  . He fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party. Since then, Wengui, who is a member of President Donald Trumpâ€™s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has become known for his outspoken criticism of Chinese efforts to weed out corruption. G News is the media arm of Guo Media, a company linked to Wengui.   in October that the company paid Bannon, Trumpâ€™s former chief strategist and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, at least $1 million for \"strategic consulting services.\" Both Bannon and Wengui have their own sections on G News. .

The company also said it has been questioned by special counsel  's team about the payments to Cohen. NBC News reported later Wednesday that a senior Novartis official said that Cohen reached out shortly after Trump's election \"promising access\" to the new administration. Novartis said it signed a one-year contract with Cohen's shell company, Essential Consultants, for $100,000 per month in February 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated as president. Novartis said it believed Cohen \"could advise the company as to how the Trump administration might approach certain U.S. health-care policy matters, including the Affordable Care Act.\" But just a month after signing the deal, Novartis executives had their first meeting with Cohen, and afterward \"determined that Michael Cohen and Essentials Consultants would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated.\" But Novartis kept paying Cohen. \"As the contract, unfortunately, could only be terminated for cause, payments continued to be made until the contract expired by its own terms in February 2018,\" Novartis said. That means that Cohen was paid up to $1.2 million for his work. On Tuesday, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for porn star  , said investigators for  Avenatti said that   paid $200,000 to Essential Consultants in four installments of $50,000 each per month. On Wednesday,  that because Essential Consultants had a year-long contract with AT&T.  If Cohen was paid for the full year by AT&T at a rate of $50,000 per month, he would have received $600,000. AT&T on Wednesday declined to reveal when asked by CNBC how much it had actually paid Cohen under the contract, which it said the company entered into because it wanted \"insights\" on the Trump administration. Essential Consultants was created in October 2016, on the eve of the presidential election. Shortly after its creation, Essential Consultants was used to pay Daniels $130,000, Cohen has admitted. Daniels said the money was in exchange for her agreement to not talk to others about a 2006 affair she claims to have had with Trump. The White House has denied the president had sex with the adult film actress. Novartis also said it was contacted by Mueller's team last November, and was asked about the deal with Cohen. Novartis said it cooperated with those queries \"and provided all the information requested.\" Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as possible collusion by the Trump campaign in that interference. Cohen is under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in New York for issues related to his business dealings. The payment to Daniels is among the areas being eyed by investigators in that probe. Here is the full statement from Novartis on Wednesday: In February 2017, shortly after the election of President Trump, Novartis entered into a one year agreement with Essential Consultants. With the recent change in administration, Novartis believed that Michael Cohen could advise the company as to how the Trump administration might approach certain US healthcare policy matters, including the Affordable Care Act. The agreement was for a term of one year, and paid Essential Consultants 100,000 USD per month. In March 2017, Novartis had its first meeting with Michael Cohen under this agreement. Following this initial meeting, Novartis determined that Michael Cohen and Essential Consultants would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated related to US healthcare policy matters and the decision was taken not to engage further. As the contract unfortunately could only be terminated for cause, payments continued to be made until the contract expired by its own terms in February 2018. The engagement of Essential Consultants predated Vas Narasimhan becoming Novartis CEO and he was in no way involved with this agreement. Contrary to recent media reports, this agreement was also in no way related to the group dinner Dr. Narasimhan had at the World Economic Forum in Davos with President Trump and 15 Europe based industry leaders. Suggestions to the contrary clearly misrepresent the facts and can only be intended to further personal or political agendas as to which Novartis should not be a part. In terms of the Special Counsel's office, Novartis was contacted in November 2017 regarding the company's agreement with Essential Consultants. Novartis cooperated fully with the Special Counsel's office and provided all the information requested. Novartis considers this matter closed as to itself and is not aware of any outstanding questions regarding the agreement. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Contrary to recent media reports, this agreement was also in no way related to the group dinner Dr. Narasimhan had at the World Economic Forum in Davos with President Trump and 15 Europe based industry leaders. Suggestions to the contrary clearly misrepresent the facts and can only be intended to further personal or political agendas as to which Novartis should not be a part. In terms of the Special Counsel's office, Novartis was contacted in November 2017 regarding the company's agreement with Essential Consultants. Novartis cooperated fully with the Special Counsel's office and provided all the information requested. Novartis considers this matter closed as to itself and is not aware of any outstanding questions regarding the agreement. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

You can have a virus where people feel well enough while theyâ€™re infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.\" Gates cited the 1918 Spanish flu as an example of a virus that spreads through the air.Â  \"So hereâ€™s what would happen,\" he says. \"It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly. And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic. So this is a serious problem. We should be concerned.\" He then discusses how we could build a good response system â€” how we could be prepared for the next epidemic.Â  \"Thereâ€™s no need to panic,\" he says. \"We donâ€™t have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down to the basement. But we need to get going, because time is not on our side. In fact, if thereâ€™s one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, itâ€™s that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready. If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.\" The Facebook post says that Gates told Americans about the coronavirus in 2015.Â But in the 2015 TED talk featured in the video, he never actually uses the word coronavirus, nor does he mention COVID-19.Â  His comments do sound prescient, though. He talks about an epidemic and weâ€™re now in the midst of  . People   for days, if at all. And itâ€™s   between people in close contact through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes.

Three COVID-19 vaccines have been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since mid-December 2020. Prior to authorization by the FDA, these vaccines underwent the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standards as all other vaccines. Quickly, vaccine distribution began, starting with health care professionals on the frontlines of patient care. Once available to the broader public, itâ€™s critical that a high percentage of the population receive the vaccine in order to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19. Herd immunity occurs when most of a population is immune to an infectious disease (either from previous infection and/or vaccination) and provides indirect protection to those who are not immune to the disease. There have been many rumors flying around on the internet about whatâ€™s in the vaccine. Some rumors even suggested that the vaccines contain gluten, wheat, eggs and even bee venom! All of that is simply, untrue. If youâ€™re among the many wondering â€œwhatâ€™s actually in it?â€ and, â€œis it safe to receive the injection?â€, keep reading. There are two COVID-19 messenger-ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines currently authorized for emergent use in the United States: the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines. A third vaccine developed by Johnson &Johnson (J&J) Janssen uses a viral vector platform. Conventional vaccines, rely on weakened and inactivated pathogens or a fragment of the pathogen to trigger an immune response. In contrast, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines use a new approach by which mRNA is delivered into our cells to provide the genetic instructions for our own cells to â€œtemporarilyâ€ make a â€œspecificâ€ viral protein (the coronavirus spike protein) that triggers an immune response. The J&J COVID-19 vaccine is a type of â€œreplication-incompetent vector vaccine.â€ This vaccine also contains the genetic instructions to express a stabilized coronavirus spike protein, but instead of mRNA, these instructions are delivered via DNA stored inside a modified vector virus (Adenovirus 26). This adenovirus has been engineered to enter the human cells and deliver the desired genetic information without replicating itself or causing illness. Once inside the cells, the DNA encoding for the coronavirus spike protein can be read by the cell and transcribed into mRNA. At this point, the J&J vaccine acts similarly to the mRNA vaccines. There are rumors that mRNA vaccines will alter our DNA because the RNA molecule can convert information stored in DNA into proteins. Thatâ€™s simply, not true. Itâ€™s critical to note that the mRNA vaccines never enter the nucleus of the cell, where our DNA is stored. After injection, the mRNA from the vaccine is released into the cytoplasm of the cells. Once the viral protein is made and on the surface of the cell, mRNA is broken down and the body permanently gets rid of it, therefore making it impossible to change our DNA. The remaining ingredients (below), including acids, acid stabilizers, salt and sugar all work together to maintain the stability of the vaccine after itâ€™s produced. The Adenovirus 26 in the J&J vaccine does not replicate, and like the mRNA vaccines, does not change our genetic code. â€œOverall, the main ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are very similar, and all three vaccines were found to be safe and efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease in rigorously conducted clinical trials. These COVID-19 vaccines are safe and went through the same rigorous testing process as other vaccines before being approved for emergent use in the United States.

The Department of Justice announced today that the Chair of Harvard Universityâ€™s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department and two Chinese nationals have been charged in connection with aiding the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. Â  Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested this morning and charged by criminal complaint with one count of making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement.Â  Lieber will appear this afternoon before Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. Yanqing Ye, 29, a Chinese national, was charged in an indictment today with one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy. Ye is currently in China.Â  Zaosong Zheng, 30, a Chinese national, was arrested on Dec. 10, 2019, at Bostonâ€™s Logan International Airport and charged by criminal complaint with attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research to China. Â On Jan. 21, 2020, Zheng was indicted on one count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements.Â  He has been detained since Dec. 30, 2019. According to court documents, since 2008, Dr. Lieber who has served as the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, which specialized in the area of nanoscience, has received more than $15,000,000 in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD). Â These grants require the disclosure of significant foreign financial conflicts of interest, including financial support from foreign governments or foreign entities. Unbeknownst to Harvard University beginning in 2011, Lieber became a â€œStrategic Scientistâ€ at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China and was a contractual participant in Chinaâ€™s Thousand Talents Plan from in or about 2012 to 2017. Â Chinaâ€™s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of Chinaâ€™s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. Â These talent programs seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.Â  Under the terms of Lieberâ€™s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT paid Lieber $50,000 USD per month, living expenses of up to 1,000,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 USD at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. Â In return, Lieber was obligated to work for WUT â€œnot less than nine months a yearâ€ by â€œdeclaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name ofâ€ WUT. The complaint alleges that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and affiliation with WUT.Â  On or about, April 24, 2018, during an interview with investigators, Lieber stated that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program, but he â€œwasnâ€™t sureâ€ how China categorized him. Â In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and Chinaâ€™s Thousand Talents Plan. Â Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber â€œhad no formal association with WUTâ€ after 2012, that â€œWUT continued to falsely exaggerateâ€ his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber â€œis not and has never been a participant inâ€ Chinaâ€™s Thousand Talents Plan.Â  According to the indictment, Ye is a Lieutenant of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA), the armed forces of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Â On her J-1 visa application, Ye falsely identified herself as a â€œstudentâ€ and lied about her ongoing military service at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), a top military academy directed by the CCP.Â  It is further alleged that while studying at Boston Universityâ€™s (BU) Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering from October 2017 to April 2019, Ye continued to work as a PLA Lieutenant completing numerous assignments from PLA officers such as conducting research, assessing U.S. military websites and sending U.S. documents and information to China. According to court documents, on April 20, 2019, federal officers interviewed Ye at Bostonâ€™s Logan International Airport. During the interview, it is alleged that Ye falsely claimed that she had minimal contact with two NUDT professors who were high-ranking PLA officers.Â  However, a search of Yeâ€™s electronic devices demonstrated that at the direction of one NUDT professor, who was a PLA Colonel, Ye had accessed U.S. military websites, researched U.S. military projects and compiled information for the PLA on two U.S. scientists with expertise in robotics and computer science. Â Furthermore, a review of a WeChat conversation revealed that Ye and the other PLA official from NUDT were collaborating on a research paper about a risk assessment model designed to decipher data for military applications. Â During the interview, Ye admitted that she held the rank of Lieutenant in the PLA and admitted she was a member of the CCP. In August 2018, Zheng entered the United States on a J-1 visa and conducted cancer-cell research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston from Sept. 4, 2018, to Dec. 9, 2019. It is alleged that on Dec. 9, 2019, Zheng stole 21 vials of biological research and attempted to smuggle them out of the United States aboard a flight destined for China. Â Federal officers at Logan Airport discovered the vials hidden in a sock inside one of Zhengâ€™s bags, and not properly packaged.Â  It is alleged that initially, Zheng lied to officers about the contents of his luggage, but later admitted he had stolen the vials from a lab at Beth Israel. Â Zheng stated that he intended to bring the vials to China to use them to conduct research in his own laboratory and publish the results under his own name. The charge of making false, fictitious and fraudulent statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Â The charge of visa fraud provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Â The charge of acting as an agent of a foreign government provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Â The charge of smuggling goods from the United States provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Â Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C.

Bottoms told CNN that she had seen her mother the day prior and that she would need to be tested as well. The day before Bottoms made the announcements on social media and national television, she hosted a news conference filled with a room full of police, fire ChiefÂ Randall Slaughter, three Atlanta City Council members, media and family members of 8-year-old shooting victim Secoriea Turner. She wore a mask but removed it to makeÂ   about Turner's death, which occurred Saturday near the Wendy's that had been occupied by armed demonstrators in the aftermath of Rayshard Brooks' police killing last month. Interim police Chief Rodney Bryant also spoke at the microphone. Bottoms told MSNBC on Monday that she got tested because her husband had been sleeping a lot since Thursday. â€œWhich is just not like him,â€ she said. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms addresses her positive coronavirus diagnosis saying she believes she mistook the symptoms of the virus for allergies    Bottoms said she and her family had been diligent about washing their hands and wearing masks. â€œI have no idea when and where we were exposed,â€ she said. Bottoms reiterated those comments on CNN but added that she had experienced very mild symptoms, comparing them to seasonal allergies. According to an administrative order signed by Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Kathleen E. Toomey last month, anyone who comes within six feet of an affected person  for 15 minutes or more will have to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days. The news conference scenario can be low-risk if proper precautions are taken, according to Emory University infectious disease expert Dr. Marybeth Sexton. She said it was unlikely most attendees of the mayorâ€™s news conference were exposed as long as they were wearing masks. The CDC defines exposure as at least 15 minutes of face-to-face contact with a COVID-19 carrier when neither party is wearing a mask. According to Sexton, it is also unlikely that the interim police chief could have been infected from speaking into the same microphone as Bottoms. â€œSurface contamination is thought to be rare,â€ Sexton said.Â â€œYou would have to put your hand on the microphone and then in your mouth.â€ As a precaution, the fire chiefÂ has opted to self-quarantine pending the results of a COVID-19 test. MORE:Â  Bottoms will have to isolate herself and cooperate with state and local public health personnel to identify and locate those she came into contact with two days before her positive test sample, according to the order. She may also have to provide a list of locations she visited during the time she might have potentially transmitted the disease. Violation of the order is considered a misdemeanor. In interviews on CNN and ABCâ€™s â€œGood Morning America,â€ Bottoms said she believed the state reopened too aggressively. Despite Atlantaâ€™s phased reopening plan, COVID-19 cases have surged recently in Fulton County along with the rest of Georgia. â€œI think we were too aggressive in opening up.â€  Atlanta Mayor   speaks on new cases rising as the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia reopen.    As Bottoms has tried to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and unrest overÂ  Â here in Atlanta, she has steadily emerged as a legitimateÂ  Â to be presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's running mate.

Joe Maldonado-Passage (aka Joe Exotic) has tested positive for coronavirus.  As a result, the Tiger King has been moved to a prison hospital for treatment after contracting the illness while incarcerated in Texas. The 57-year-old is currently serving a 22-year sentence for animal abuse as well as attempting to take out a hitman on Carole Baskin.  Joeâ€™s current husband, Dillon Passage, 24, had recently told a radio show that Joe had been moved to isolation after cases of COVID-19 had been reported at the prison he had recently been moved from. Dillon said: â€œSince heâ€™s been moved to this new facility, they are putting him on a COVID-19 isolation because of the previous jail he was at, there were cases.â€ T  says Joeâ€™s diagnosis was confirmed onÂ Texomashompage.com,Â which stated he has tested positive for COVID-19 and has been transferred to a hospital. Tiger King is everywhere right now. Youâ€™re either talking about coronavirus, or shouting â€˜Hey there cool cats and kittens!â€™ to your friends over the House Party app.  Although   puts Joe front and centre, the seven-part series introduced us to the likes of Vegas kingpin Jeff Lowe, eccentric park owner Doc Antle,  rk-inspired Rick Kirkman, walking Chucky doll James Garretson, and, of course, John Finlay. The shirt-hating Floridian became famous for his not quite perfect teeth. Heâ€™s now had them sorted, and he looks unrecognisable.  This comes after Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister reopened the case of Caroleâ€™s missing ex-husband, Jack Donald Lewis. Whatever you think of Netflixâ€™s   â€” we assume youâ€™ve binged it all by now â€” thereâ€™s no denying Baskin is one of the seriesâ€™ most divisive characters. The dramatic climax of   saw Joe behind bars after being convicted for his part in a murder for hire plot against Carole, however, the road to the final episode was a long one. One of the biggest twists came early on in the series with the revelation Caroleâ€™s first husband vanished under mysterious circumstances. Now, Florida authorities are re-opening the case of Jack Donald Lewis. Posting on Twitter, Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister shared an appeal and said, â€œSince @NetflixÂ and #Covid19 #Quarantine has made #TigerKingâ€‹ all the rage, I figured it was a good time to ask for new leads.â€ Chronister also posted a picture of Lewis and reminded everyone he hasnâ€™t been seen since August 18, 1997. Thereâ€™s no escaping the fact Joe thinks Carole killed her husband and fed him to the tigers â€” an allegation that grows alongside their feud with each other. It also led to the frankly brilliant   soundbite of, â€œHey Carole, itâ€™s a voice from your pastâ€¦ GET ME THE F**K OUT FROM UNDER THE SEPTIC TANK!â€  The news comes after new claims from author Robert Moore. Moore is something of an expert on all things Baskin and Exotic and spent four years working on a podcast about the whole debacle. Writing on Twitter, Moore claimed he spoke to an ex of Caroleâ€™s and that Baskin once said the ominous line of: â€œDead bodies canâ€™t talkâ€™.â€ Even Gwyneth Paltrow has got in on the action and given her own views on what she thinks happened. One person tweeted, â€œAbsolutely iconic how Carole Baskin did Tiger King thinking sheâ€™d get to expose Joe Exotic and Doc Antle for animal abuse and now all of America is obsessed with Joe and thinks Carole is a murderer. Thatâ€™s showbiz baby.â€ Gwyneth simply wrote back: â€œTHERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION.â€ Iâ€™ll admit, my   journey was quite the rollercoaster and I went from feeling for Carole to rooting for Joe.

Meet Joe Exotic, the gun-toting operator of an Oklahoma big cat park. Heâ€™s been accused of hiring someone to murder his chief rival, Carole Baskin. Subjected to long hours, little (or no) pay and the whims of eccentric bosses: are big cat park employees just cogs in a web of personality cults? An incident in Carole's past casts her in a suspicious light, and while she maintains her innocence, Joe is all too happy to point the finger at her. Joe ramps up his efforts to become an internet and TV star, but a mysterious fire and lawsuit threaten his plans â€” until an angel investor appears. As Joe dives into politics, he deals with turmoil and tragedy in his personal life. Meanwhile, the dynamics at the park change with the new owners. James Garretson makes a shocking claim about Joe, leading to FBI involvement. Desperation sets in for Joe, who thinks Jeff and James have set him up. Joe faces the music in the courtroom but insists the story is far from over. Jeffâ€™s business prospects crumble. Former G.W. Zoo workers try to move on.

There are literally thousands of doctors and scientists around the world who have spoken out against these experimental injections, some even calling them â€œ .â€ Their voices are censored in the pharma-controlled corporate media and by Big Tech, so the people dying and becoming injured by these injections are the pro-vaccine people who primarily only get their information from these censored sources that are funded by Wall Street corporate billionaires, such as Bill Gates. The CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), aÂ   that tracks injuries and deaths reported to be caused by vaccines, reported only 36 deaths during the first quarter of 2020 through March 31st, and almost 50% of those deaths were infants below the age of 3. Since today, the day this report is being written and published, is the last day of March, 2021, we do not have complete stats from VAERS on injuries and deaths following vaccination yet. But hereâ€™s what we know based on what the CDC has published through yesterday, March 30, 2021.

So we ran the report for this year, 2021, from which we know the data is only current through March 19, 2021, and it showed 1,754 deaths following ALL vaccines, not just the COVID injections. Notice that 80% of these recorded deaths are among seniors over the age of 65! How is this NOT a national tragedy that should be headline news everywhere?? As noted above, there are 2050 deaths recorded following COVID injections as of March 19th, but those include some deaths in December, 2020. Yesterday, the CDC reported that deaths following COVID injections are now 2,509. ( .) That is an increase of 459 deaths from what the CDC reported through VAERS through March 19th. So 1754 plus these 459 deaths gives us the total deaths so far through March 2021, which is 2,213, although after the next data dump in to VAERS this coming Friday, this number will increase even more when we add the non-COVID vaccine deaths also. That is an increase of over 6000% from last year during the same time period. The increase in deaths reported is most certainly related to the new experimental COVID injections, and yet the CDC and FDAâ€™s position is that NOT ONE of these deaths are related to the COVID injections.

So far, these tragic deaths are among the foolish who drank the COVID Kool Aid and did not bother to research these new medical products themselves first, blindly trusting in â€œhealth authoritiesâ€ like   and   who are MASS MURDERERS.

I don't think the 37 out of 47 statement is accurate, to support capacity strengthening in high-risk countries around the world global disease detection and other programs magnetized. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick. In the end, that didn't happen. The president's budget proposed slashing funding for CDC's (global health security) initiatives, did not have to cut back its work priority countries, to support national public health institutes and global health security. Iâ€™m happy to say, he only attempted to cut funding for them, but that did not ultimately go into effect. Isnâ€™t that good? The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries, Do you know that Trump closed 37 of them? set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus, exactly, The View, \n","text2  By  Posted on        \n","i 397\n","Y2 Please enable JavaScript in your web browser; otherwise some parts of this site might not work properly. \n","\t          An official website of the United States government\n","\t       \n"," \n"," \n","\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA   website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\n","\t\t\t\t\t\t \n"," \n"," \n","\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA   (\n","\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n","\t\t\t\t\t\t\t) or https:// means youâ€™ve safely connected to the .gov website.

(AP) â€” So much for the mayorâ€™s order requiring masks at Super Bowl parties. Videos went viral on social media, showing throngs of mostly maskless fans and packed sports bars as the clock inside Raymond James Stadium ticked down on a hometown Super Bowl win for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. â€œIt is a little frustrating because we have worked so hard,â€ Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said during an early Monday morning news conference with the Super Bowl Host Committee. â€œAt this point in dealing with COVID-19, there is a level of frustration when you see that.â€ Some 200,000 masks were handed out ahead of the game, and â€œa majorityâ€ of people and businesses followed the rules, she said.  Hours later, during another news conference, Castorâ€™s remarks shifted, saying that at least among those people that she saw celebrating, most of them were masked. â€œIâ€™m proud to say the majority of individuals that I saw out and about enjoying the festivities associated with the Super Bowl were complying,â€ she said. â€œThey understood their level of personal responsibility and they were doing the right thing. Iâ€™m very proud of that.â€ Even the White House weighed in.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about whether President Joe Biden was concerned over Tampa fans taking to the streets following the Buccaneers Super Bowl.  â€œHe is of course concerned when there are pictures and photos - we all are - that show many, many people without masks in close distance with one another at the height of a pandemic,â€ she said. To meet coronavirus protocols, the NFL capped the crowd at under 25,000 in a stadium that normally holds some 66,000 fans, and required masks.  But outside the stadium, crowds of fans who werenâ€™t wearing masks or practicing social distancing could be seen celebrating the Buccaneersâ€™ 31-9 win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night. Folks cheered, crammed into bars and hugged in several hotspots around the city â€” and swarmed the streets â€” all without masks. In hopes of curbing so-called super-spreader events, Castor had signed a largely voluntary executive order requiring people wear face coverings during the Super Bowl festivities, even while theyâ€™re outdoors. She pleaded with people to celebrate safely, noting the city could issue fines of up to $500. It wasnâ€™t clear on Monday how many citations the city handed out, if any.  The mayor noted that there had been no major spikes in COVID-19 cases following the fall Stanley Cup win by the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team and outdoor celebrations surrounding that victory. â€œWe didnâ€™t see those spikes after the Stanley Cup events,â€ she said. Local orders were overridden last year by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose executive order made it difficult for local governments to enforce mask policies because it prohibits them from fining people who donâ€™t comply. Florida has never had a mask policy. Across Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg, Mayor Rick Kriseman was already unhappy about a maskless party hosted by Rapper Curtis â€œ50 Centâ€ Jackson in a hangar at Albert Whitted Airport on Friday night. Pictures from the party posted on social media showed a densely packed event with few people wearing masks to protect against spread of the coronavirus. â€œThis isnâ€™t how we should be celebrating the Super Bowl,â€ the mayor     on Saturday. â€œItâ€™s not safe or smart.

Also on the call, Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie, who discussed the recommendation that faculty, staff, students and their family members be encouraged to stay home if they are feeling sick, and to self-isolate for 14 days if they have visited any high risk coronavirus countries. \"We really should work to let our families and students know that they should self-report and self-isolate if they intend to travel, especially over spring break, to any of the high-risk places,\" Runcie said.

But are we there now? The answer is probably no. But when weÂ willÂ get there and what level do we need to get there are still open questions that people are debating, The governor said that we are â€˜closeâ€™ to herd immunity. Depending on your definition of â€˜close,â€™ that may be the case, We hope that within the next five or so months weâ€™ll be able to answer the very important question about whether vaccinated people get infected asymptomatically, and if they do, do they transmit the infection to others, simple math But triangulating from different surveys, from different models, you can kind of get a sense of what we're talking about here. Itâ€™s a guess, because we just don't have all the information at our fingertips, How big of a slice of the population is that? That's up for debate. There is a significant portion of the population that has acquired immunity â€” they've been infected and they've recovered, likely represent only a fraction of the true number of cases that have occurred in the population, true number of recoveries, But I don't think anybody can do a calculation and predict when that's going to happen. When we see that occur, we can look back and say we achieved herd immunity, There are a lot of variables for what actually constitutes herd immunity threshold, and the reality is I donâ€™t think weâ€™ll know when we achieve itÂ until weâ€™re looking backwards, I would think that you would need somewhere between 70, 75, maybe 80%, very close very close to herd immunity It looks like it could be very close to herd immunity, Do you think you have herd immunity in Texas now? When you add all the number of vaccinations that are taking place, as well asÂ all of the acquired immunity from Texans who have been exposed and recovered from COVID-19, it means, very simply, itâ€™s a whole lot more difficult for COVID to be spreadingÂ to other people in the state of Texas. We absolutely aren't declaring victory at this time. We remain very vigilant and guarded and proactive in our response, but there's simple math behind the reason why we continue to have success, simple math. \n","text2 Sign in to comment!

Oh do I like Florida. Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Everything I hear, weâ€™re winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say, â€œThe polls are tied in Florida.â€ I donâ€™t get it. I donâ€™t. We heard the same thing last year. Remember? Four years ago, we heard the same thing. â€ Weâ€™re going to lose Florida,â€ they said four years ago, â€œby five points.â€ They called that thing so early in the evening and we won by a lot. And weâ€™re winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","22 days from now, weâ€™re going to win this state. Weâ€™re going to win four more years in the White House. Weâ€™re going to make our country greater than it has ever been before. Thank you, man. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to say it in 2016. Iâ€™m sorry, at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important weâ€™ve ever had. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his partyâ€™s nomination. Heâ€™s handed control to the socialists, the Marxists and the left-wing extremists. And you know that. And heâ€™s got no strength left. Heâ€™s got no power left. Heâ€™s got nothing going. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","If he wins, the radical left will be running the country and theyâ€™re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again. And you couldnâ€™t make a comeback. You donâ€™t make comebacks from where theyâ€™d take us. If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, itâ€™s because frankly, Iâ€™m not a politician. Iâ€™m embarrassed by the throne. And if I donâ€™t always play by the rules of Washington establishment, itâ€™s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you. And I had a very nice life before this, I will tell you. And a lot easier. But I love this, that I would have never, ever change because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now. We caught them cold and weâ€™ll see what happens with that. Just watch, stay tuned. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Right now Iâ€™m fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. Weâ€™re hitting record stock market numbers, record 401Ks, record stocks, record job numbers. Donâ€™t blow it. Donâ€™t blow it. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. He wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again, he said, â€œOh no, weâ€™re not going to give a tax increase, but weâ€™re going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.â€ Well, thatâ€™s $2,000 plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things, youâ€™re talking about $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 a year. I donâ€™t think Florida is going to be paying that per family. And if you add energy into that, we have energy at all time low. Weâ€™re energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you are paying less than $2 at the pump like you are, nobody ever thought youâ€™d see those days again. And those days are here for a long time if weâ€™re smart. Weâ€™ve been beating China. Weâ€™ve been beating everybody. Until the plague came in, we were teaching China like theyâ€™ve never been taught before and they know it. And theyâ€™ve told me that and they never thought it could happen. And weâ€™re very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign. Itâ€™s our campaign. Itâ€™s our campaign, not my campaign. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","There was spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very, very straightforward and legally sworn in administration. We were sworn in. They tried before the fact, they tried after the fact. We were an adminâ€¦ And then they say, â€œWe want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power.â€ For four years, theyâ€™ve been trying to get us out of office. Four years theyâ€™ve been trying to get us out, but weâ€™ll take care of it all after the election. We caught them cold. We caught them cold. Bad people, crooked Hillary. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","And by the way, Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening, okay? Just in case you had any question. Weâ€™ll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists, but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. Because we donâ€™t, theyâ€™ll just sweep it under the rug. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders. You know that? Release criminal aliens, confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment, get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going to happen. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","You saw in the pledge of allegiance during the Democrat National Convention. They took the word God out twice. They said, â€œOh, we made a mistake. Excuse me.â€ And then it happened a second time. We said, â€œWell, I guess that wasnâ€™t a mistake, right?â€ Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many, many, many decades. And thatâ€™s what they want to do. They canâ€™t get there legitimately. So theyâ€™re said, â€œThatâ€™s all right. Weâ€™ll just pack the court. Weâ€™ll put a lot of super lefties on the court and weâ€™ll have a whole different country.â€ Nope. Not going to happen that way. Weâ€™re not going to let it happen. You got to get out and vote. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","A lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court, because I said Iâ€™m going to put great conservative, constitutionalists, great judges on the Supreme Court. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s true. But if it is true, itâ€™s more true now than it was four years ago. And you got to get out and vote because theyâ€™re going to destroy our country and theyâ€™re going to destroy our US Supreme Court, and we canâ€™t let that happen. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But who would have thought? Weâ€™re on number three. Other presidents have never had any. Theyâ€™ve never had any. Weâ€™re at three already, three and a half years. And I will say this, I will say this. Itâ€™s driving them crazy. Itâ€™s driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect, a great scholar. I think sheâ€™s going to be a fantastic US Supreme Court Justice. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","As America saw earlier today in Amyâ€™s opening statement in the Senate, Judge Barrett, a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws, our rights, our freedom, and our constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. Theyâ€™re enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what theyâ€™re doing and where theyâ€™re going, but we understand it. We understand their canceled culture. Weâ€™re not letting them cancel culture us at all. Weâ€™re proud of our country and weâ€™re proud of our heritage. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","They want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare, and thatâ€™s what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela, and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans. And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida. You have been so incredible to Trump. Bidenâ€™s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors. And by the way, Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that, right? And you know the deal that I broke, you saw that? Right as I came into office, Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said, â€œNo, thank you. Weâ€™re not doing that.â€ Thatâ€™s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans, thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens. Now, we all have a heart and we all want to take care of people. But what youâ€™re doing is youâ€™re telling millions of people to pour up into our country. Weâ€™re going to give you education. Weâ€™re going to give you healthcare. Weâ€™re going to give you everything. We canâ€™t do it. We canâ€™t afford it. We canâ€™t take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","While Iâ€™m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen and we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the State of Florida. And I have to say, it was practically that way for almost every state in the union. But it was Floridaâ€™s best year. The year coming is going to be, and youâ€™re going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So Iâ€™m putting myself on the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year weâ€™ve ever had economically. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But as Iâ€™ve done from the beginning, I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You havenâ€™t heard that, right? You havenâ€™t heard that from other people. Under my leadership, weâ€™re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody could even believe. And if you look at our upward path, no country in the world has recovered the way weâ€™ve recovered economically or otherwise, not even close. And if you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, thatâ€™s all we want. We want a normal life. Weâ€™ll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well, will reach historic new highs. Highs like theyâ€™ve never reached before. Biden would terminate our recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Floridaâ€™s economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown. Thatâ€™s what he- Donald Trump: ( ) \n","â€¦ his economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. Thatâ€™s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. And you know what? If you donâ€™t feel good about going out, stay, relax, stay. You know the risk groups, you know the older people. See, fortunately, Iâ€™m not an old person. Iâ€™m very young and Iâ€™m in such perfect shape. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Iâ€™m in such great shape. I said that the other day. I said, â€œWell, Iâ€™m very young, and Iâ€™m in great shape, perfect shape.â€ And they said, â€œDonald Trump misrepresented today, again. He said he was in great shape, that heâ€™s very young.â€ These people are the sickest of them all. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted the Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where theyâ€™re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You canâ€™t do that. And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida. Youâ€™re open and open for business and doing great. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","And we got to remember, I said it right at the beginning, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. The cure can not be worse, but if you donâ€™t feel good about it, if you want to stay, stay, relax, stay. But if you want to get out there, get out. One thing with me, the nice part, I went through it. Now they say Iâ€™m immune. I feel so powerful. I will walk into that audience. Iâ€™ll walk in there, Iâ€™ll kiss everyone in that audience. Iâ€™ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, and everybody. Iâ€™ll just give you a big, fat kiss. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","No, but there is something nice. I donâ€™t have to be locked up in my basement, and I wouldnâ€™t allow that to happen anyway. I wouldnâ€™t allow it to happen. When youâ€™re the president, you canâ€™t lock yourself in a basement and say, â€œIâ€™m not going to bother with the world.â€ You got to get out, and itâ€™s risky. Itâ€™s risky, but you got to get out. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something, and now they say youâ€™re immune. I donâ€™t know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean, every time I think about it, every time I hear them, it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible. But it is a great feeling. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","I want to thank, by the way, Walter Reed Medical Hospital, Johns Hopkins. These guys are incredible. Weâ€™re 90% better now than we were six, seven months ago, in terms of a cure for people that get really sick, 90%. Itâ€™s incredible whatâ€™s happened. And with children is 99.9%, youâ€™re going to be okay. Youâ€™re going to be okay. 99. 9. They have a little better immune systems, we just learned that, better than you have, better than we all have. But we love our children, but we have to get our schools open. We have to get up businesses going back. We have to get our country rolling, and it is rolling. Youâ€™re going to see that when the numbers come out. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","The Biden virus plan â€¦ and you got to remember, he took H1N1, which he always calls in N1H1. He gets it mixed up. I said, â€œNo, Joe. H comes first.â€ But itâ€™s called the swine flu. Right? And his own person, his chief of staff, said that it was a disaster the way they ran it. A much less lethal problem, but a disaster, the way they ran it, a total catastrophe. It was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says, â€œIâ€™m going to tell him what to do. But when I locked down China, he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic when I locked down China, which was in January, months earlier than what he said. Then ultimately, admitted Iâ€™m right, but then he said, â€œOh, he should have acted faster.â€ Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Well, this was months later that he says I should have acted â€¦ Nobody acted fast like I did. I also shut down, locked down Europe, if you remember. And the bottom line is we saved millions of lives. When this first came out, if we didnâ€™t do a good job, they predicted 2.2 million people would die. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Weâ€™re 210,000. We shouldnâ€™t be at one. Itâ€™s Chinaâ€™s fault. They allowed this to happen. They allowed it to escape China. But 2.2 million people would have died. Just remember that, just to remember that, a fact they donâ€™t like talking about. I have such respect for the people of this country, the way theyâ€™ve handled it. Itâ€™s been an incredible love fest together. Thatâ€™s really what itâ€™s been. And sympathies from all of us, to those people who, whose family members have died, whose friends â€¦ Iâ€™ve lost friends. Iâ€™ve lost friends. Audience: ( ) \n","We love you. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you very much. Audience: ( ) \n","We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Audience: ( ) \n","We love you. We love you. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Youâ€™re going to love me even more. Youâ€™re going to love me even more, because weâ€™re years ahead on vaccines, and theyâ€™re going to be distributed very shortly. I mean, frankly, itâ€™s a big political deal going on, where they donâ€™t want it to be before the election. Donâ€™t let it be. But we have great vaccines coming. Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. I mean, we have great, great things happening with the vaccines. I think even greater with the cures and with the therapeutics. And maybe itâ€™s why Iâ€™m here with you. Maybe itâ€™s not, Iâ€™m not sure. I know one thing, I was very happy to take it, that I can tell you. But through Operation Warp Speed, weâ€™re on track to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, and theyâ€™ll be delivered by the military, and theyâ€™re all set to go. Theyâ€™re waiting for final approval. And that vaccine will end the pandemic, but weâ€™re also launching a historic effort to bring your medical supply chains back home. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","In 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Ricoâ€™s thriving pharmaceutical industry. Remember, they used to have a great pharmaceutical industry. He cut it out. And when he cut it out, he sent Puerto Rico into a nosedive like nobodyâ€™s ever seen before. So weâ€™re bringing it all back, and weâ€™re bringing it back to Florida too. Weâ€™re bringing it all the way back, taking our jobs away from China. Weâ€™re bringing it back from China. Iâ€™ll reverse. Bidenâ€™s catastrophic decision. Weâ€™ll bring it all back. The drug industryâ€™s coming back into Puerto Rico, coming back into, by the way, Pennsylvania, coming back into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, coming back into Michigan, coming back into Ohio. Weâ€™re bringing it all back. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Last month, I also announced an additional $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and for Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. My administrationâ€™s allocated over $60 billion. And if you look at Florida, where your great governors, your last two governors have been great, your two senators, great. Theyâ€™re always calling, asking for money, but I guess thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re supposed to be doing. And Iâ€™m always giving it when it comes to Florida. The panhandle got hit really hard over the last two years. We took care of the panhandle. So days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the governor of Puerto Rico. Can you believe that? Right? Wanda VÃ¡zquez Garced. And she was so nice. They were also joined by several great Puerto Rican community leaders, [ Jay Rosario 00:00:25:00], [Gabe Ruiz 00:08:02], [Daisy Lopezid 00:25:05], Myra Guzman-Kaslow and candidate for Congress. Dr. Leo Valentina. Please, where are you? Where are you? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","[inaudible 00:00:25:20]. Iâ€™m not going to say the best, but Iâ€™m just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico. You better vote. But Iâ€™ll always be fighting for Puerto Rico. Itâ€™s very unfair the way they were treated by Democrats. And while Biden will surrender your jobs to China, your country and your fellow politicians, and I have a lot of great ones right here, including your governor. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Wow. We will never allow ourselves to even think about surrendering to the left wing mob. Theyâ€™re on the run. Theyâ€™re on the run. Better not have them have a little bit of a victory, because if they have even a little victory, itâ€™s not going to be good. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Iâ€™m bringing our jobs back home and putting violent criminals behind bars. Iâ€™m working with your political leaders. Weâ€™ve also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law. Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins, there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place, but heâ€™s not going to win. He may be the worst presidential candidate in history, and I got him, I got him. It actually puts more pressure on you. If you ran against a great candidate, thereâ€™s actually less pressure. You want to know the truth. Audience: ( ) \n","Four more years. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Audience: ( ) \n","Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Audience: ( ) \n","Four more years. Four more years. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","No, we want to keep our country great. Weâ€™re bringing it to a level that itâ€™s never been. Our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen, no country has ever seen, all made in the USA, rockets, missiles, tanks, ships, the likes of which, jet fighters, bombers, tankers, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. Our nuclear arsenal is the strongest by far in the world, the strongest itâ€™s ever been. And hope to God, we never have to even think about using it. And the way you wonâ€™t have to use it is to have it. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","At our debate, Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him, not one, and thatâ€™s because â€¦ And by the way, did Vice President Mike Pence do a great job? Audience: ( ) \n","[crosstalk 00:28:06]. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Right? [inaudible 00:28:07]. Did a great job. But itâ€™s because Biden and Harris, thatâ€™s another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her, nobody. And so, brilliantly, I said he canâ€™t pick her, because nobody treated him as badly. Although I will say this, had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday, we would have had Bernie instead. But Iâ€™d rather have Biden, because heâ€™s now alienated the left. Heâ€™s alienated the right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for. How about Pennsylvania? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","He goes to Pennsylvania. For a year-and-a-half, heâ€™s against fracking. The day he gets the nomination, through a little luck, because she didnâ€™t get out. So she took all of Bernieâ€™s votes, right? But following day, he said, â€œIâ€™m in favor of fracking.â€ But heâ€™s not. And it doesnâ€™t matter, because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio, never let them frack. Thatâ€™s over with. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But can you imagine? And the press, which is fake and corrupt, the press never said â€¦ Have you ever heard him asked? No. Have you ever heard him asked once, â€œWell, wait a minute. For one year, you said there will be no fracking.â€ And he said it strongly, right? You know, â€œRead my lips.â€ Right? To use an old expression, â€œRead my lips, there will be no fracking.â€ That didnâ€™t work out too well. So now he goes, and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say, â€œA billion dollars. If you donâ€™t change that prosecutor, youâ€™re not getting the billion dollars.â€ And then he goes, â€œWhoa, the prosecutor was changed.â€ The prosecutor against his son. Not once have I heard them talking about that question. Can you imagine if we did that? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","And on top of everything else, the Democrat Party declared war on our great police and law enforcement. Thatâ€™s what it is. So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the National Latino Police Officers Association, the Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations, plus all over the country. And when I asked him, â€œName one organization, give me one organization.â€ During our debate, where he was saved by the moderator about four times, he couldnâ€™t answer it. Name one law enforcement organization. He couldnâ€™t name one. Then I said, â€œSay the words, law enforcement, just say it.â€ Couldnâ€™t do it. He couldnâ€™t say it. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Weâ€™re joined tonight by a great group of people, warriors, really warriors. He came to me a couple of years ago. He said, â€œSir, I want to run for governor.â€ I said, â€œRon, I donâ€™t know. Do they know you well enough?â€ But he was a great defender and a brilliant guy, Harvard, Yale, top of his class, smart as hell. Nobody knows how smart. Donâ€™t tell too many people. He likes to catch you by surprise. But heâ€™s a great, great guy, and heâ€™s been a great friend. I said, â€œAll right, Iâ€™ll endorse you.â€ I endorsed him, and the rest â€¦ he went like a rocket ship, and he handled the pressure. And his wife, Casey, is better than him. Iâ€™ve been saying it for a long time. Governor Ron De Santis and Casey. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Great guy. Great, great couple. Great, great couple. Smart, brilliant. Sit down, please. Really, theyâ€™re a great group of people. Those people are great, and he surrounds himself with incredible people, with the exception, of course, of Representative Matt Gaetz. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Oh, Matt Gaetz. You talk about a warrior, right? Ron, what do you think, huh? Matt Gaetz is a great man, a great gentleman, and what a future he has. I donâ€™t know about swap it, but I think I might. Thank you, Matt. Thank you.. Thank you both for being here. Appreciate it. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","John Rutherford. Where is John? John? Thank you, John. Mike Waltz. Mike, thank you. Thank you. Nice couple. Gus Bilirakis. Gus? Gus? Congressional candidate, somebody whoâ€™s supposed to be potentially a superstar. Now, weâ€™ve heard that a lot. Sometimes it works out. Itâ€™s going to in his case, Scott Franklin. Scott? Thank you. Oh, heâ€™s got the look. He could be. Thatâ€™s good. Thatâ€™s good. I hear good things, Scott. Going well? Howâ€™s he doing, Ron? Heâ€™s doing good? Ron says youâ€™re doing good. Good. You got to win it. Thank you, Scott, very much. Kimberly. Whereâ€™s Kimberly? Kimberly? Thank you. I watched you coming in, speaking. I said, â€œThatâ€™s a lot to follow.â€ Kimberly is great. I want to thank Kimberly. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","And finally, weâ€™re joined by a group of amazing supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be â€¦ Donald Trump: ( ) \n","â€¦ supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be voting for us. We have a lot of, a lot of them. And a lot of them in law enforcement, a lot of law enforcement, they were democrats, in some cases they left their party. In other cases, they just said, â€œNo, weâ€™re voting for Trump.â€ I said, â€œWhy are you doing that?â€ â€œWe have no choice.â€ I said, â€œYouâ€™re right, youâ€™re right.â€ But nobodyâ€™s been better to law enforcement than I have. You know when I first came in, we gave away hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment that was in storage. Wasnâ€™t doing anybody any good, it was collecting dust, probably paying rent all over the place. Thatâ€™s probably why they had it, come to think of it. But look how far that crowd goes back. Hey, hey cameras, will you please? Oh man, look at that. Man. Thatâ€™s into those hangers. Wow. Audience: ( ) \n","U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Donald Trump: ( ) \n","You know, these are the real polls. So when did you hear about this meeting, like a day ago, these are the real polls, right? The other guy gets out there and heâ€™s â€¦ they work at work and work and 30 people show up. They put them in those crazy circles, right? They only have the circles because thatâ€™s the only way they can fill up the room, itâ€™s true. But thatâ€™s a fantastic group of people, thank you. Same thing over here. I wish the fake news would turn the cameras. For a long time, I didnâ€™t think the cameras moved that way, but then anytime there was a little sign of problems, they could twist around like a pretzel and I realized they could. But they donâ€™t like to show those crowds, but that is a massive amount. I donâ€™t know how many people are here, but you got a lot. I want to thank you. So this evening, weâ€™re also praying for all of the families on the Florida Panhandle effected by Hurricane Sally. And I will tell you, Ron and Marco, and everybody, Iâ€™ll tell you, Rick, everybodyâ€™s been calling and calling. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Matt Gates has been going â€¦ driving us a little crazy. Matt, you can take it a little easy. But thatâ€™s what somebody thatâ€™s good is supposed to do, right? Youâ€™re supposed to call. But we take care of the Panhandle and weâ€™re doing it at a level thatâ€™s never been done before. And Iâ€™ve done it, I think I can say right from the beginning, right? I tell the story about Ron DeSantis. He came to see me, he just became governor. â€œWe had a hurricane. Sir, thank you very much for the money you send to the Panhandle in Florida. I appreciate it.â€ â€œGood, Ron, good. I hope itâ€™s enough. Good, spend it well.â€ I get a call like three days later. â€œSir, could I see you?â€ Now, Iâ€™m in Washington.

Dr. Nabarro was repeating our advice to governments to â€˜do it all,â€™ Our position on lockdowns and other severe movement restrictions has been consistent since the beginning. We recognize that they are costly to societies, economies and individuals, but may need to be used if COVID-19 transmission is out of control. That is why Nabarro said lockdowns are not recommended as the â€˜primaryâ€™ control measure. Critics like to frame lockdowns as being recommended as the only measure, when in reality that is not the case. Strict lockdowns are best used sparingly and in a time-limited fashion because they can cause negative health and economic consequences, No one is saying that lockdowns should never be used, just that they shouldn't be used as a primary or only method, Weâ€™re saying we really do have to learn how to coexist with this virus in a way that doesnâ€™t require constant closing down of economies, but at the same time in a way that is not associated with high levels of suffering and death, everyone was lied to middle path. My comments were taken totally out of context. The WHO position is consistent. We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources; protect your health workers who are exhausted. But by and large, weâ€™d rather not do it. definition has differed country by country and state by state. I would argue that the U.S. has never had an actual enforced lockdown like there have been in some Asian countries and in Italy last spring, But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where theyâ€™re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You canâ€™t do that. The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing! admitted \n","text2 Oct 12, 2020 President Donald Trump held a campaign rally in Sanford, Florida on October 12â€”the first since his COVID-19 diagnosis. Read the transcript of his rally speech here.  and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Hello everybody. Hello Orlando. Hello Sanford. Itâ€™s great to be with you. Thank you. Itâ€™s great to be back. Thatâ€™s a lot of people. Our competitor sleepy Joe, he had a rally today and practically nobody showed up. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. Sleepy Joe. But itâ€™s great to be back in my home state, Florida to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support. Weâ€™ve had such incredible support and here we are. Here we are. But weâ€™re going to finish. Weâ€™re going to make this country greater than ever before. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Weâ€™ve made tremendous progress. If you look at what weâ€™re doing with therapeutics and frankly cures, weâ€™ve made tremendous progress. And I said to my people, we are going to take whatever the hell they gave me and weâ€™re going to distribute it around to hospitals and everyoneâ€™s going to have the same damn thing. Weâ€™ve all endured a lot together. And we are doing better by far than we ever did in 2016. The enthusiasmâ€™s greater. The spirit is greater. Weâ€™re going to have, if itâ€™s possible, an even greater and more important victory than we had just four years ago. And nobody ever said this fight was not going to be a hard one, but we will make it like youâ€™ve never seen before. We are more successful now than weâ€™ve ever been before. Our military is rebuilt. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Take a look at whatâ€™s going on with our economy. I hate to say to the fake news, weâ€™re about to hit another stock market record, 401Ks. Sleepy Joe Biden. Not a nice guy, by the way. I have to be honest. Heâ€™s not a nice guy. People say, â€œOh, heâ€™s such a nice guy.â€ He had a very bad day today. He had a very bad day. You saw what happened. If I ever had a day like he had today, theyâ€™d say itâ€™s over. Itâ€™s over. No Biden had a bad day. He forgot Mitt Romneyâ€™s name. He didnâ€™t know what state he was in. And he said today heâ€™s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate. No you canâ€™t. Canâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s the second time. Can you imagine if I did that? â€œItâ€™s great to be with you. Itâ€™s great to be a wonderful developer from New York.â€ Theyâ€™d say heâ€™s out of here. Get him out. No, Biden had a bad day. Heâ€™s got a lot of bad days coming. Look, look, we canâ€™t play games. The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China did us no favor. President Putin of Russia, youâ€™re looking around. Kim Jong-un, whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, theyâ€™re 100% sharp. We have somebody running whoâ€™s not 100%. Heâ€™s not 80%. Heâ€™s not 60%. We canâ€™t have this as a country. We canâ€™t have it. Joe Biden is also owned by the radical globalists, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in this ridiculous, endless wars. Set of endless wars that weâ€™ve been in for a long time. 19 years, theyâ€™re all coming back home. You know that, right? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Theyâ€™re all coming back home. Our great warriors, our great soldiers. The corrupt political class is desperate to regain their power by any means necessary. Weâ€™re the one standing in their way. Weâ€™re the one standing up for the American worker, the American family, and for the American dream. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing on this beautiful evening. This beautiful evening in Florida. Oh do I like Florida. Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Everything I hear, weâ€™re winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say, â€œThe polls are tied in Florida.â€ I donâ€™t get it. I donâ€™t. We heard the same thing last year. Remember? Four years ago, we heard the same thing. â€ Weâ€™re going to lose Florida,â€ they said four years ago, â€œby five points.â€ They called that thing so early in the evening and we won by a lot. And weâ€™re winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","22 days from now, weâ€™re going to win this state. Weâ€™re going to win four more years in the White House. Weâ€™re going to make our country greater than it has ever been before. Thank you, man. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to say it in 2016. Iâ€™m sorry, at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important weâ€™ve ever had. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his partyâ€™s nomination. Heâ€™s handed control to the socialists, the Marxists and the left-wing extremists. And you know that. And heâ€™s got no strength left. Heâ€™s got no power left. Heâ€™s got nothing going. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","If he wins, the radical left will be running the country and theyâ€™re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again. And you couldnâ€™t make a comeback. You donâ€™t make comebacks from where theyâ€™d take us. If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, itâ€™s because frankly, Iâ€™m not a politician. Iâ€™m embarrassed by the throne. And if I donâ€™t always play by the rules of Washington establishment, itâ€™s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you. And I had a very nice life before this, I will tell you. And a lot easier. But I love this, that I would have never, ever change because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now. We caught them cold and weâ€™ll see what happens with that. Just watch, stay tuned. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Right now Iâ€™m fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. Weâ€™re hitting record stock market numbers, record 401Ks, record stocks, record job numbers. Donâ€™t blow it. Donâ€™t blow it. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. He wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again, he said, â€œOh no, weâ€™re not going to give a tax increase, but weâ€™re going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.â€ Well, thatâ€™s $2,000 plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things, youâ€™re talking about $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 a year. I donâ€™t think Florida is going to be paying that per family. And if you add energy into that, we have energy at all time low. Weâ€™re energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you are paying less than $2 at the pump like you are, nobody ever thought youâ€™d see those days again. And those days are here for a long time if weâ€™re smart. Weâ€™ve been beating China. Weâ€™ve been beating everybody. Until the plague came in, we were teaching China like theyâ€™ve never been taught before and they know it. And theyâ€™ve told me that and they never thought it could happen. And weâ€™re very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign. Itâ€™s our campaign. Itâ€™s our campaign, not my campaign. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","There was spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very, very straightforward and legally sworn in administration. We were sworn in. They tried before the fact, they tried after the fact. We were an adminâ€¦ And then they say, â€œWe want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power.â€ For four years, theyâ€™ve been trying to get us out of office. Four years theyâ€™ve been trying to get us out, but weâ€™ll take care of it all after the election. We caught them cold. We caught them cold. Bad people, crooked Hillary. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","And by the way, Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening, okay? Just in case you had any question. Weâ€™ll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists, but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. Because we donâ€™t, theyâ€™ll just sweep it under the rug. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders. You know that? Release criminal aliens, confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment, get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going to happen. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","You saw in the pledge of allegiance during the Democrat National Convention. They took the word God out twice. They said, â€œOh, we made a mistake. Excuse me.â€ And then it happened a second time. We said, â€œWell, I guess that wasnâ€™t a mistake, right?â€ Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many, many, many decades. And thatâ€™s what they want to do. They canâ€™t get there legitimately. So theyâ€™re said, â€œThatâ€™s all right. Weâ€™ll just pack the court. Weâ€™ll put a lot of super lefties on the court and weâ€™ll have a whole different country.â€ Nope. Not going to happen that way. Weâ€™re not going to let it happen. You got to get out and vote. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","A lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court, because I said Iâ€™m going to put great conservative, constitutionalists, great judges on the Supreme Court. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s true. But if it is true, itâ€™s more true now than it was four years ago. And you got to get out and vote because theyâ€™re going to destroy our country and theyâ€™re going to destroy our US Supreme Court, and we canâ€™t let that happen. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But who would have thought? Weâ€™re on number three. Other presidents have never had any. Theyâ€™ve never had any. Weâ€™re at three already, three and a half years. And I will say this, I will say this. Itâ€™s driving them crazy. Itâ€™s driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect, a great scholar. I think sheâ€™s going to be a fantastic US Supreme Court Justice. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","As America saw earlier today in Amyâ€™s opening statement in the Senate, Judge Barrett, a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws, our rights, our freedom, and our constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. Theyâ€™re enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what theyâ€™re doing and where theyâ€™re going, but we understand it. We understand their canceled culture. Weâ€™re not letting them cancel culture us at all. Weâ€™re proud of our country and weâ€™re proud of our heritage. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","They want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare, and thatâ€™s what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela, and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans. And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida. You have been so incredible to Trump. Bidenâ€™s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors. And by the way, Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that, right? And you know the deal that I broke, you saw that? Right as I came into office, Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said, â€œNo, thank you. Weâ€™re not doing that.â€ Thatâ€™s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans, thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens. Now, we all have a heart and we all want to take care of people. But what youâ€™re doing is youâ€™re telling millions of people to pour up into our country. Weâ€™re going to give you education. Weâ€™re going to give you healthcare. Weâ€™re going to give you everything. We canâ€™t do it. We canâ€™t afford it. We canâ€™t take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","While Iâ€™m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen and we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the State of Florida. And I have to say, it was practically that way for almost every state in the union. But it was Floridaâ€™s best year. The year coming is going to be, and youâ€™re going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So Iâ€™m putting myself on the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year weâ€™ve ever had economically. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But as Iâ€™ve done from the beginning, I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You havenâ€™t heard that, right? You havenâ€™t heard that from other people. Under my leadership, weâ€™re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody could even believe. And if you look at our upward path, no country in the world has recovered the way weâ€™ve recovered economically or otherwise, not even close. And if you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, thatâ€™s all we want. We want a normal life. Weâ€™ll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well, will reach historic new highs. Highs like theyâ€™ve never reached before. Biden would terminate our recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Floridaâ€™s economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown. Thatâ€™s what he- Donald Trump: ( ) \n","â€¦ his economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. Thatâ€™s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. And you know what? If you donâ€™t feel good about going out, stay, relax, stay. You know the risk groups, you know the older people. See, fortunately, Iâ€™m not an old person. Iâ€™m very young and Iâ€™m in such perfect shape. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Iâ€™m in such great shape. I said that the other day. I said, â€œWell, Iâ€™m very young, and Iâ€™m in great shape, perfect shape.â€ And they said, â€œDonald Trump misrepresented today, again. He said he was in great shape, that heâ€™s very young.â€ These people are the sickest of them all. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted the Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where theyâ€™re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You canâ€™t do that. And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida. Youâ€™re open and open for business and doing great. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","And we got to remember, I said it right at the beginning, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. The cure can not be worse, but if you donâ€™t feel good about it, if you want to stay, stay, relax, stay. But if you want to get out there, get out. One thing with me, the nice part, I went through it. Now they say Iâ€™m immune. I feel so powerful. I will walk into that audience. Iâ€™ll walk in there, Iâ€™ll kiss everyone in that audience. Iâ€™ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, and everybody. Iâ€™ll just give you a big, fat kiss. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","No, but there is something nice. I donâ€™t have to be locked up in my basement, and I wouldnâ€™t allow that to happen anyway. I wouldnâ€™t allow it to happen. When youâ€™re the president, you canâ€™t lock yourself in a basement and say, â€œIâ€™m not going to bother with the world.â€ You got to get out, and itâ€™s risky. Itâ€™s risky, but you got to get out. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something, and now they say youâ€™re immune. I donâ€™t know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean, every time I think about it, every time I hear them, it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible. But it is a great feeling. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","I want to thank, by the way, Walter Reed Medical Hospital, Johns Hopkins. These guys are incredible. Weâ€™re 90% better now than we were six, seven months ago, in terms of a cure for people that get really sick, 90%. Itâ€™s incredible whatâ€™s happened. And with children is 99.9%, youâ€™re going to be okay. Youâ€™re going to be okay. 99. 9. They have a little better immune systems, we just learned that, better than you have, better than we all have. But we love our children, but we have to get our schools open. We have to get up businesses going back. We have to get our country rolling, and it is rolling. Youâ€™re going to see that when the numbers come out. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","The Biden virus plan â€¦ and you got to remember, he took H1N1, which he always calls in N1H1. He gets it mixed up. I said, â€œNo, Joe. H comes first.â€ But itâ€™s called the swine flu. Right? And his own person, his chief of staff, said that it was a disaster the way they ran it. A much less lethal problem, but a disaster, the way they ran it, a total catastrophe. It was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says, â€œIâ€™m going to tell him what to do. But when I locked down China, he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic when I locked down China, which was in January, months earlier than what he said. Then ultimately, admitted Iâ€™m right, but then he said, â€œOh, he should have acted faster.â€ Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Well, this was months later that he says I should have acted â€¦ Nobody acted fast like I did. I also shut down, locked down Europe, if you remember. And the bottom line is we saved millions of lives. When this first came out, if we didnâ€™t do a good job, they predicted 2.2 million people would die. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Weâ€™re 210,000. We shouldnâ€™t be at one. Itâ€™s Chinaâ€™s fault. They allowed this to happen. They allowed it to escape China. But 2.2 million people would have died. Just remember that, just to remember that, a fact they donâ€™t like talking about. I have such respect for the people of this country, the way theyâ€™ve handled it. Itâ€™s been an incredible love fest together. Thatâ€™s really what itâ€™s been. And sympathies from all of us, to those people who, whose family members have died, whose friends â€¦ Iâ€™ve lost friends. Iâ€™ve lost friends. Audience: ( ) \n","We love you. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you very much. Audience: ( ) \n","We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Audience: ( ) \n","We love you. We love you. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Youâ€™re going to love me even more. Youâ€™re going to love me even more, because weâ€™re years ahead on vaccines, and theyâ€™re going to be distributed very shortly. I mean, frankly, itâ€™s a big political deal going on, where they donâ€™t want it to be before the election. Donâ€™t let it be. But we have great vaccines coming. Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. I mean, we have great, great things happening with the vaccines. I think even greater with the cures and with the therapeutics. And maybe itâ€™s why Iâ€™m here with you. Maybe itâ€™s not, Iâ€™m not sure. I know one thing, I was very happy to take it, that I can tell you. But through Operation Warp Speed, weâ€™re on track to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, and theyâ€™ll be delivered by the military, and theyâ€™re all set to go. Theyâ€™re waiting for final approval. And that vaccine will end the pandemic, but weâ€™re also launching a historic effort to bring your medical supply chains back home. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","In 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Ricoâ€™s thriving pharmaceutical industry. Remember, they used to have a great pharmaceutical industry. He cut it out. And when he cut it out, he sent Puerto Rico into a nosedive like nobodyâ€™s ever seen before. So weâ€™re bringing it all back, and weâ€™re bringing it back to Florida too. Weâ€™re bringing it all the way back, taking our jobs away from China. Weâ€™re bringing it back from China. Iâ€™ll reverse. Bidenâ€™s catastrophic decision. Weâ€™ll bring it all back. The drug industryâ€™s coming back into Puerto Rico, coming back into, by the way, Pennsylvania, coming back into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, coming back into Michigan, coming back into Ohio. Weâ€™re bringing it all back. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Last month, I also announced an additional $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and for Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. My administrationâ€™s allocated over $60 billion. And if you look at Florida, where your great governors, your last two governors have been great, your two senators, great. Theyâ€™re always calling, asking for money, but I guess thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re supposed to be doing. And Iâ€™m always giving it when it comes to Florida. The panhandle got hit really hard over the last two years. We took care of the panhandle. So days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the governor of Puerto Rico. Can you believe that? Right? Wanda VÃ¡zquez Garced. And she was so nice. They were also joined by several great Puerto Rican community leaders, [ Jay Rosario 00:00:25:00], [Gabe Ruiz 00:08:02], [Daisy Lopezid 00:25:05], Myra Guzman-Kaslow and candidate for Congress. Dr. Leo Valentina. Please, where are you? Where are you? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","[inaudible 00:00:25:20]. Iâ€™m not going to say the best, but Iâ€™m just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico. You better vote. But Iâ€™ll always be fighting for Puerto Rico. Itâ€™s very unfair the way they were treated by Democrats. And while Biden will surrender your jobs to China, your country and your fellow politicians, and I have a lot of great ones right here, including your governor. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Wow. We will never allow ourselves to even think about surrendering to the left wing mob. Theyâ€™re on the run. Theyâ€™re on the run. Better not have them have a little bit of a victory, because if they have even a little victory, itâ€™s not going to be good. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Iâ€™m bringing our jobs back home and putting violent criminals behind bars. Iâ€™m working with your political leaders. Weâ€™ve also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law. Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins, there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place, but heâ€™s not going to win. He may be the worst presidential candidate in history, and I got him, I got him. It actually puts more pressure on you. If you ran against a great candidate, thereâ€™s actually less pressure. You want to know the truth. Audience: ( ) \n","Four more years. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Audience: ( ) \n","Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Thank you. Audience: ( ) \n","Four more years. Four more years. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","No, we want to keep our country great. Weâ€™re bringing it to a level that itâ€™s never been. Our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen, no country has ever seen, all made in the USA, rockets, missiles, tanks, ships, the likes of which, jet fighters, bombers, tankers, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. Our nuclear arsenal is the strongest by far in the world, the strongest itâ€™s ever been. And hope to God, we never have to even think about using it. And the way you wonâ€™t have to use it is to have it. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","At our debate, Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him, not one, and thatâ€™s because â€¦ And by the way, did Vice President Mike Pence do a great job? Audience: ( ) \n","[crosstalk 00:28:06]. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Right? [inaudible 00:28:07]. Did a great job. But itâ€™s because Biden and Harris, thatâ€™s another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her, nobody. And so, brilliantly, I said he canâ€™t pick her, because nobody treated him as badly. Although I will say this, had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday, we would have had Bernie instead. But Iâ€™d rather have Biden, because heâ€™s now alienated the left. Heâ€™s alienated the right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for. How about Pennsylvania? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","He goes to Pennsylvania. For a year-and-a-half, heâ€™s against fracking. The day he gets the nomination, through a little luck, because she didnâ€™t get out. So she took all of Bernieâ€™s votes, right? But following day, he said, â€œIâ€™m in favor of fracking.â€ But heâ€™s not. And it doesnâ€™t matter, because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio, never let them frack. Thatâ€™s over with. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","But can you imagine? And the press, which is fake and corrupt, the press never said â€¦ Have you ever heard him asked? No. Have you ever heard him asked once, â€œWell, wait a minute. For one year, you said there will be no fracking.â€ And he said it strongly, right? You know, â€œRead my lips.â€ Right? To use an old expression, â€œRead my lips, there will be no fracking.â€ That didnâ€™t work out too well. So now he goes, and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say, â€œA billion dollars. If you donâ€™t change that prosecutor, youâ€™re not getting the billion dollars.â€ And then he goes, â€œWhoa, the prosecutor was changed.â€ The prosecutor against his son. Not once have I heard them talking about that question. Can you imagine if we did that? Donald Trump: ( ) \n","And on top of everything else, the Democrat Party declared war on our great police and law enforcement. Thatâ€™s what it is. So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the National Latino Police Officers Association, the Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations, plus all over the country. And when I asked him, â€œName one organization, give me one organization.â€ During our debate, where he was saved by the moderator about four times, he couldnâ€™t answer it. Name one law enforcement organization. He couldnâ€™t name one. Then I said, â€œSay the words, law enforcement, just say it.â€ Couldnâ€™t do it. He couldnâ€™t say it. Donald Trump: ( ) \n","Weâ€™re joined tonight by a great group of people, warriors, really warriors. He came to me a couple of years ago. He said, â€œSir, I want to run for governor.â€ I said, â€œRon, I donâ€™t know. Do they know you well enough?â€ But he was a great defender and a brilliant guy, Harvard, Yale, top of his class, smart as hell. Nobody knows how smart. Donâ€™t tell too many people.

He blamed the press for acting hysterically about the virus, which has now spread to China, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and the U.S, and he downplayed its dangers, saying against expert opinion it was on par with the flu.  â€œThe Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. They're politicizing it,â€ he said. â€œThey don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa. No, they can't. They can't count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, â€˜Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.â€™ That did not work out too well. They could not do it. They tried the impeachment hoax.â€ Then Trump called the coronavirus â€œtheir new hoax.â€ Trumpâ€™s comments came as the White House has struggled to adequately respond to and contain the coronavirusâ€™s increasingly sweeping path. At the rally â€” held here on the eve of the Democratic primary in South Carolina â€” he sought to manage Americansâ€™ expectations about the White Houseâ€™s ability to fight it. By undermining the news reporting on the virus and by trying to hold liberals responsible for a potential public health crisis that has little to do with politics, Trump did what he often does best: He sought to deflect blame at a time when many Americans sought leadership and scientific facts. After Trump had downplayed the risks of coronavirus, he reassured supporters that the White House was â€œmagnificently organizedâ€ in fighting it. In fact, Trumpâ€™s administration spent the week jockeying among themselves to lead the response, while the stock market tumbled with losses not seen since the global financial crisis in 2008. White House officials and the president grew so concerned this week that Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the response effort, swapping out his beleaguered health secretary. None of that came up on Friday night, as Trump trash-talked his Democratic opponents in 2020 and characterized the coronavirus as the latest issue touching on border security. â€œWhether it is the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and well-being of all Americans. Now, you see it with the coronavirus. You see it. You see it with the coronavirus. You see that. When you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, it's not the only thing that comes in through the border and we are setting records now at the border,â€ Trump said. Earlier in the week, the Trump administration tried to allay Americansâ€™ concerns about the virus by downplaying the coronavirusâ€™s seriousness. Trump also congratulated himself for shutting down flights between the U.S. and China. But by the end of the week, White House officials including the president had shifted to pushing back against anyone who expressed too much concern about the virus or its effect on the economy, repeatedly blaming the Democrats and the media for the growing concerns and the steep drop in the stock market amid the uncertainty. â€œItâ€™s the unknown, you know, they look at it, and they say how long will this last.

Most kafenia provide meze or snacks and rarely serve full meals. Kafenia were traditionally family-run businesses and furnished simply. The walls are often whitewashed. Â  Â  Kafenio Greek Diner is anÂ upbeat and modern version of the traditional Mediterranean cafe! Clean lines, rustic furniture, wholesome Breakfast, Salads, Wraps and Pasta with an emphasis on the flavors of the Mediterranean, refreshing and energizing beverages! Full Coffee and Espresso service w/ Craft beers and wine. In 2015, the year John Gianoulidis opened his first Kafenio in College Park, a disgruntled reviewer wrote, â€œI predict this restaurant will be out of business in less than a year.â€ Â  Itâ€™s now been four years, and the original Kafenioâ€”an all-day Greek restaurant serving Greek-inspired breakfast, lunch, brunch and dinner offeringsâ€”not only continues to thrive, but Gianoulidis is opening a second Kafenio at theÂ Willis apartment complex in Avondale Estates. Â  Itâ€™s hard to put Gianoulidis down, and itâ€™s even harder to hold him there. Â  â€œI keep standing back up,â€ he says. Â  Itâ€™s no surprise, considering his perseverance, that Gianoulidis identifies with Odysseus in Homerâ€™s The Odyssey, a mural of which appears on one of the new Kafenioâ€™s walls. Itâ€™s â€œstanding back upâ€ thatâ€™s pulled Gianoulidis from one entrepreneurial venture to the next since he left the real estate business in 2009 to be his own boss, starting with The Greek Gyros & Pizza (now closed) at the Sweet Auburn Curb Market. Â  And thatâ€™s his advice to any hopeful restaurateur seeking guidance: â€œStand back up.â€ He wonâ€™t offer something concrete, like how to go about getting permits, the best locations to scout, how to choose an architect, or where to find a good contractor. In other words, he wonâ€™t tell someone what they think they want to hear. Instead, heâ€™ll tell the truth as he knows it, and in the genuine, if brusque, way those who know him appreciate. â€œYouâ€™re going to have failures,â€ he says. â€œEverybody forgets something or messes something up. Focus on how to fix it.â€ Â  Work hard and move forwardâ€”itâ€™s an attitude Gianoulidis says was inculcated in him by his Greek parents, who in 1963 left Athens for America to escape military rule. When they arrived in this country, they viewed the American Dream not as a big house, six cars, and their name in lights, but as the simple opportunity to work and receive something for their efforts. They compared it to being farmers, Gianoulidis says: â€œYou plant, and you work, and you get something. It was the idea of the work ethic.â€ Â  Something else his parents taught him was that thereâ€™s no difference between life and business. Thatâ€™s what makes Kafenio stand out: it isnâ€™t a cold commercial venture separate from Gianoulidisâ€™s â€œreal life,â€ but is instead every bit a part of his life as are his friends. There is between Gianoulidis and his restaurants evidence of mutual influence that is as observable as the tattoos on Gianoulidisâ€™s arms, beginning with his attentiveness to his restaurantsâ€™ needs. He isnâ€™t a stranger to his restaurant, one of those absent owners oft reviled on shows like â€œGordon Ramseyâ€™s Kitchen Nightmares.â€ If a worker is ill and no replacement is available, Gianoulidis doesnâ€™t demand the other employees, who have their own work to do, take up the slack. He fills in, himself. Â  This is due in large part to an early introduction to what it meant to be conscientious about oneâ€™s own business. As a child in the â€˜70s, Gianoulidis did his homework at a corner table of his parentsâ€™ pizza place, Johnnyâ€™s Pizza, in Moosup, Conn. He learned a lot from watching his mother (whose tzatziki recipe is used at Kafenio). She didnâ€™t ask people to do things that needed to get done. She did them, herself. Â  â€œJust because youâ€™re the owner doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t do things like sweep, cook, or wash dishes,â€ Gianoulidis says. â€œIf everyone else is busy, guess whoâ€™s going to do it? Itâ€™s going to be you.â€ The new Kafenio exemplifies Gianoulidisâ€™s philosophy that business and life are not parallel entities, but an inextricable braiding together of people and place. In Greece, a Kafenio (cafÃ©) is a community hub, a place for all people, no matter their background or appearance, to feel both invited and welcome. In that vein, because the Avondale location has a more active night life, Gianoulidis has included a full barÂ  with a carefully selected assortment of Greek and Mediterranean wines, along with a curated list of domestic craft beers and some imported beers, so â€œMom and Dad can have a nice bourbon after work.â€ Â  Heâ€™s also gone against all practical advice by installing a Greek marble bar top rather than opting for something less porous, something more indestructible. And not because itâ€™s authentically Greek, but for the very reason most would avoid it: it can be marked, stained. Gianoulidis says marble has life that synthetic materials lack; it interacts with the people who use it. Â  â€œWhen I go to Greece, I like sitting on these marble-top bars that have been there for two hundred years that have marks, that have lived. You bounce off of plastic, off synthetic things,â€ Gianoulidis says. â€œMy passion is to create an environment. Iâ€™m not an artist, but this is my creation. I create a place where people can eat good food, have a drink, and feel welcome no matter what.â€ FOLLOW US Â© Kafenio 2021 \n","text1 mandates restaurants reopen. industry is taking a completely universal approach regardless of what the policy says, Most standard policies list pandemics as an exclusion.

Most kafenia provide meze or snacks and rarely serve full meals. Kafenia were traditionally family-run businesses and furnished simply. The walls are often whitewashed. Â  Â  Kafenio Greek Diner is anÂ upbeat and modern version of the traditional Mediterranean cafe! Clean lines, rustic furniture, wholesome Breakfast, Salads, Wraps and Pasta with an emphasis on the flavors of the Mediterranean, refreshing and energizing beverages! Full Coffee and Espresso service w/ Craft beers and wine. In 2015, the year John Gianoulidis opened his first Kafenio in College Park, a disgruntled reviewer wrote, â€œI predict this restaurant will be out of business in less than a year.â€ Â  Itâ€™s now been four years, and the original Kafenioâ€”an all-day Greek restaurant serving Greek-inspired breakfast, lunch, brunch and dinner offeringsâ€”not only continues to thrive, but Gianoulidis is opening a second Kafenio at theÂ Willis apartment complex in Avondale Estates. Â  Itâ€™s hard to put Gianoulidis down, and itâ€™s even harder to hold him there. Â  â€œI keep standing back up,â€ he says. Â  Itâ€™s no surprise, considering his perseverance, that Gianoulidis identifies with Odysseus in Homerâ€™s The Odyssey, a mural of which appears on one of the new Kafenioâ€™s walls. Itâ€™s â€œstanding back upâ€ thatâ€™s pulled Gianoulidis from one entrepreneurial venture to the next since he left the real estate business in 2009 to be his own boss, starting with The Greek Gyros & Pizza (now closed) at the Sweet Auburn Curb Market. Â  And thatâ€™s his advice to any hopeful restaurateur seeking guidance: â€œStand back up.â€ He wonâ€™t offer something concrete, like how to go about getting permits, the best locations to scout, how to choose an architect, or where to find a good contractor. In other words, he wonâ€™t tell someone what they think they want to hear. Instead, heâ€™ll tell the truth as he knows it, and in the genuine, if brusque, way those who know him appreciate. â€œYouâ€™re going to have failures,â€ he says. â€œEverybody forgets something or messes something up. Focus on how to fix it.â€ Â  Work hard and move forwardâ€”itâ€™s an attitude Gianoulidis says was inculcated in him by his Greek parents, who in 1963 left Athens for America to escape military rule. When they arrived in this country, they viewed the American Dream not as a big house, six cars, and their name in lights, but as the simple opportunity to work and receive something for their efforts. They compared it to being farmers, Gianoulidis says: â€œYou plant, and you work, and you get something. It was the idea of the work ethic.â€ Â  Something else his parents taught him was that thereâ€™s no difference between life and business. Thatâ€™s what makes Kafenio stand out: it isnâ€™t a cold commercial venture separate from Gianoulidisâ€™s â€œreal life,â€ but is instead every bit a part of his life as are his friends.

Viruses are not made by gene fusion of two animals. As far as the origins of COVID-19 is concerned, it is likely that the infected   from the wet livestock market of Wuhan are the original source of the virus. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) transmits mainly via respiratory droplets that people sneeze, cough, or exhale, in addition to touching contaminated surfaces or people and subsequently touch the face. HIV does not spread by touching. It can spread by unprotected sex, transfusion of blood contaminated with HIV and from a mother to the child during gestation and delivery. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant which protects the body against oxidative challenges. A review analysis   suggests that for the prophylactic prevention of infection, the human body requires a dietary dose of vitamin C levels between 100-200 mg/day. However, another review   argues that there are limited evidence-based clinical trials to conclusively support this contention. Vitamin C infusion is currently being tried for treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia in a randomized clinical trial registered by Professor Zhi-Yong Peng Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China (identifier number NCT04264533 at  ). However, the results are pending. The claim that hot lemon cures cancer is an old piece of misinformation that resurfaces from time to time. It has been adequately debunked by   in 2019, David Mikkelson at   in 2011, and Brett M. Christensen at   in 2018. There is no catch-all cure for cancer as it is a single name for many diseases. Cancer can arise from many causes including gene mutations at random, mutations caused by external agents such as radiation and smoking, infections such as papilloma wart virus that causes cervical cancer, and also genetics such as the inheritable BRCA1 gene responsible for breast cancer.

This tweet and others, linked the presence of the military vehicles to prison disturbances in Palermo this week  It's true that the military were on the streets in Palermo, but their presence wasn't connected to the prison disturbances.  The Italian military have confirmed that the vehicles belonged to the 6th Lancieri d'Aosta regiment, stationed in Palermo. They were returning from a military exercise in Sardinia and were not deployed to deal with unrest among prisoners, nor for any other reason related to the coronavirus. This false claim surfaced in an Italian leaflet which was reportedly distributed to shops and homes in one particular area of the Venice region.  It said the vaccine was created in Australia to combat Covid-19, and the only country in the world to have bought it is Switzerland. It claimed that taking six doses of the vaccine would give protection from the virus for a year, and was available for 50 euros via an email address given in the leaflet. There is, however, no vaccine available anywhere in the world,  , says James Gallagher, BBC Health and Science correspondent. One Italian fact-checking site which picked up on the story said \"a vaccine does not exist, but what does exist are people who enjoy spreading lies.\" Misleading information about other ways to prevent the virus has also been circulating on social media.

Laws regulating concealed weapons vary by state, but sheriffs in many states have debunked the rumor. Wearing a face mask can   of the novel coronavirus, but their use has become political. One   from the Pew Research Center found that 83% of liberal Democrats said they usually wear a face mask, while 49% of conservative Republicans said that they do. So it may not be surprising that the issue has crossed over to another politically divisive topic â€” gun laws. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   sharing a meme that falsely claims: â€œKnow what else wearing a mask does??? Anyone?? REMOVES YOUR CONCEAL CARRY ability.Â  Thatâ€™s right!! Its in the rules. CCW licencees are NOT allowed to wear face coverings while carrying.â€ But there are no blanket â€œrulesâ€ that apply to wearing a mask while carrying a concealed weapon.  and sheriffs across the country have issued statements debunking the claim. â€œConcealed carry is a state by state deal,â€  , chair of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice public administration department, told us by email. â€œWith that said, I can tell you that none of the 8 states I have had permits in have any such rule.â€ Provisions related to wearing masks or face coverings â€œare not necessarily in concealed carry statutes,â€ Anne Teigen told us by email.Â She covers state firearms policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those regulations are often found in separate statutes. The NCSL compiled a list of 18 such state laws, plus one in the District of Columbia. Most of those laws address the use of a face covering during the commission of a crime or to conceal a personâ€™s identity. None of the laws specifically reference someone carrying a legally permitted concealed weapon. Weâ€™ll use North Carolina as an example since, as Eller pointed out, the stateâ€™s concealed carry law  Â   after Gov. Roy Cooper   on June 24 that everyone must wear face coverings while in public. Nowhere in North Carolinaâ€™s   does it mention the use of face masks or coverings. But an unrelated section of state law does. Itâ€™s titled, â€œ â€ and when it was passed in 1953 it was referred to as the â€œ .â€ Whatâ€™s relevant to the claim made in this meme is that the law specifies: No part of that law applies specifically to concealed weapon permit holders. Furthermore, each provision requires that the intent be to â€œconceal the identity of the wearer.â€ So the law doesnâ€™t apply to face coverings for medical or public health reasons. In addition, Cooper   a   in May that temporarily amended that law, specifying that those who are â€œwearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or othersâ€ are exempt.      North Carolina sheriffâ€™s offices also have publicly clarified that itâ€™s not illegal to wear a COVID-19-related mask while carrying a legally permitted concealed weapon. As the rumor spread widely online,       have done the same. Responding to the broad claim in the meme,  , a professor at Stanford Law School who has done research in the area of concealed carry laws, told us by email, â€œThis issue is largely the product of either the paranoid element that exists in part of the American gun community or the malicious element that also exists in part of the gun community that often seeks to divide Americans, which is particularly reprehensible at this stressful time. â€œIf you are lawfully carrying a concealed weapon, no one will know, so the mask will be a non-issue. If you are wearing a mask to protect your health or that of others, you cannot be prosecuted,â€ Donohue said. â€œThe only problem that would occur would be if you are trying to conceal your identity to commit a crime, in which case you are a criminal and should be arrested.â€ So, while laws vary by state, we were unable to find an example of a regulation that makes it illegal to carry a permitted concealed weapon while wearing a face mask for health reasons. And there is no nationwide rule that would broadly apply to all concealed carry permit holders. McDonald, Jessica. â€œ â€ FactCheck.org. 6 Apr 2020.

Laws regulating concealed weapons vary by state, but sheriffs in many states have debunked the rumor. Wearing a face mask can   of the novel coronavirus, but their use has become political. One   from the Pew Research Center found that 83% of liberal Democrats said they usually wear a face mask, while 49% of conservative Republicans said that they do. So it may not be surprising that the issue has crossed over to another politically divisive topic â€” gun laws. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   sharing a meme that falsely claims: â€œKnow what else wearing a mask does??? Anyone?? REMOVES YOUR CONCEAL CARRY ability.Â  Thatâ€™s right!! Its in the rules. CCW licencees are NOT allowed to wear face coverings while carrying.â€ But there are no blanket â€œrulesâ€ that apply to wearing a mask while carrying a concealed weapon.  and sheriffs across the country have issued statements debunking the claim. â€œConcealed carry is a state by state deal,â€  , chair of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice public administration department, told us by email. â€œWith that said, I can tell you that none of the 8 states I have had permits in have any such rule.â€ Provisions related to wearing masks or face coverings â€œare not necessarily in concealed carry statutes,â€ Anne Teigen told us by email.Â She covers state firearms policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those regulations are often found in separate statutes. The NCSL compiled a list of 18 such state laws, plus one in the District of Columbia. Most of those laws address the use of a face covering during the commission of a crime or to conceal a personâ€™s identity. None of the laws specifically reference someone carrying a legally permitted concealed weapon.

From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the â€œv-safe after vaccination health checkerâ€ surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases). Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes. The first coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines available in the United States were messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines: BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna). In December 2020, the vaccines were granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a two-dose series, 3 weeks apart for Pfizerâ€“BioNTech and 1 month apart for Moderna, and were recommended for use by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).  Pregnant persons were excluded from preauthorization clinical trials, and only limited human data on safety during pregnancy were available at the time of authorization. However, pregnant persons with Covid-19 are at increased risk for severe illness (e.g., resulting in admission to an intensive care unit, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mechanical ventilation) and death, as compared with nonpregnant persons of reproductive age.  Furthermore, pregnant persons with Covid-19 might be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, as compared with pregnant persons without Covid-19.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP, in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have issued guidance indicating that Covid-19 vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant persons. Postauthorization monitoring in pregnant persons is necessary to characterize the safety of these new Covid-19 vaccines, which use mRNA, lipid nanoparticles, and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes. Furthermore, establishing their safety profiles is critical to inform recommendations on maternal vaccination against Covid-19. We report preliminary findings of mRNA Covid-19 vaccine safety in pregnant persons from three U.S. vaccine safety monitoring systems: the â€œv-safe after vaccination health checkerâ€ surveillance system,  the v-safe pregnancy registry,  and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). V-safe is a new CDC smartphone-based active-surveillance system developed for the Covid-19 vaccination program; enrollment is voluntary. V-safe sends text messages to participants with weblinks to online surveys that assess for adverse reactions and health status during a postvaccination follow-up period. Follow-up continues 12 months after the final dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. During the first week after vaccination with any dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, participants are prompted to report local and systemic signs and symptoms during daily surveys and rank them as mild, moderate, or severe; surveys at all time points assess for events of adverse health effects. If participants indicate that they required medical care at any time point, they are asked to complete a report to the VAERS through active telephone outreach. To identify persons who received one or both Covid-19 vaccine doses while pregnant or who became pregnant after Covid-19 vaccination, v-safe surveys include pregnancy questions for persons who do not report their sex as male. Persons who identify as pregnant are then contacted by telephone and, if they meet inclusion criteria, are offered enrollment in the v-safe pregnancy registry. Eligible persons are those who received vaccination during pregnancy or in the periconception period (30 days before the last menstrual period through 14 days after) and are 18 years of age or older. For persons who choose to enroll, the pregnancy registry telephone-based survey collects detailed information about the participant, including medical and obstetric history, pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and contact information for obstetric and pediatric health care providers to obtain medical records; infants are followed through the first 3 months of life. Details about v-safe and v-safe pregnancy registry methods have been published previously. The VAERS is a national spontaneous-reporting (passive-surveillance) system established in 1990 that is administered by the CDC and the FDA.  Anyone can submit a report to the VAERS. Health care providers are required to report certain adverse events after vaccination, including pregnancy-related complications resulting in hospitalization and congenital anomalies, under the conditions of the EUAs for Covid-19 vaccines ; the CDC encourages reporting of any clinically significant maternal and infant adverse events. Signs and symptoms of adverse events are coded with the use of the   (MedDRA), version 23.1.  We used a pregnancy-status question in the VAERS form and a MedDRA code and text-string search to identify reports involving vaccination in pregnant persons. V-safe outcomes included participant-reported local and systemic reactogenicity to the BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) vaccine and the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine on the day after vaccination among all pregnant persons 16 to 54 years of age and among nonpregnant women 16 to 54 years of age as a comparator. For analysis of pregnancy outcomes in the v-safe pregnancy registry, data were restricted to completed pregnancies (i.e., live-born infant, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, or stillbirth). Participant-reported pregnancy outcomes included pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortion and stillbirth) and neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, congenital anomalies, small size for gestational age, and neonatal death) (Table S1 in the  , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). In the VAERS, outcomes included nonâ€“pregnancy-specific adverse events and pregnancy- and neonatal-specific adverse events. Demographic information and pregnancy characteristics are described for both v-safe and VAERS participants. Descriptive analyses were performed with the use of v-safe survey data for persons who identified as pregnant through February 28, 2021 (35,691 persons); persons enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry who were vaccinated through February 28, 2021 (3958 persons); and VAERS reports involving pregnant women received through February 28, 2021 (221 persons). Local and systemic reactogenicity was compared between persons who identified as pregnant and nonpregnant women. Descriptive analyses were conducted with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). All activities were reviewed by the CDC and were conducted in accordance with applicable federal law and CDC policy. From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, a total of 35,691 v-safe participants identified as pregnant. Age distributions were similar among the participants who received the Pfizerâ€“BioNTech vaccine and those who received the Moderna vaccine, with the majority of the participants being 25 to 34 years of age (61.9% and 60.6% for each vaccine, respectively) and non-Hispanic White (76.2% and 75.4%, respectively); most participants (85.8% and 87.4%, respectively) reported being pregnant at the time of vaccination ( ). Solicited reports of injection-site pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia were the most frequent local and systemic reactions after either dose for both vaccines ( ) and were reported more frequently after dose 2 for both vaccines. Participant-measured temperature at or above 38Â°C was reported by less than 1% of the participants on day 1 after dose 1 and by 8.0% after dose 2 for both vaccines. Shown are solicited reactions in pregnant persons and nonpregnant women 16 to 54 years of age who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine â€” BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) â€” from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. The percentage of respondents was calculated among those who completed a day 1 survey, with the top events shown of injection-site pain (pain), fatigue or tiredness (fatigue), headache, muscle or body aches (myalgia), chills, and fever or felt feverish (fever). These patterns of reporting, with respect to both most frequently reported solicited reactions and the higher reporting of reactogenicity after dose 2, were similar to patterns observed among nonpregnant women ( ). Small differences in reporting frequency between pregnant persons and nonpregnant women were observed for specific reactions (injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons, and other systemic reactions were reported more frequently among nonpregnant women), but the overall reactogenicity profile was similar. Pregnant persons did not report having severe reactions more frequently than nonpregnant women, except for nausea and vomiting, which were reported slightly more frequently only after dose 2 (Table S3). As of March 30, 2021, the v-safe pregnancy registry call center attempted to contact 5230 persons who were vaccinated through February 28, 2021, and who identified during a v-safe survey as pregnant at or shortly after Covid-19 vaccination. Of these, 912 were unreachable, 86 declined to participate, and 274 did not meet inclusion criteria (e.g., were never pregnant, were pregnant but received vaccination more than 30 days before the last menstrual period, or did not provide enough information to determine eligibility). The registry enrolled 3958 participants with vaccination from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, of whom 3719 (94.0%) identified as health care personnel. Among enrolled participants, most were 25 to 44 years of age (98.8%), non-Hispanic White (79.0%), and, at the time of interview, did not report a Covid-19 diagnosis during pregnancy (97.6%) ( ). Receipt of a first dose of vaccine meeting registry-eligibility criteria was reported by 92 participants (2.3%) during the periconception period, by 1132 (28.6%) in the first trimester of pregnancy, by 1714 (43.3%) in the second trimester, and by 1019 (25.7%) in the third trimester (1 participant was missing information to determine the timing of vaccination) ( ). Among 1040 participants (91.9%) who received a vaccine in the first trimester and 1700 (99.2%) who received a vaccine in the second trimester, initial data had been collected and follow-up scheduled at designated time points approximately 10 to 12 weeks apart; limited follow-up calls had been made at the time of this analysis. Among 827 participants who had a completed pregnancy, the pregnancy resulted in a live birth in 712 (86.1%), in a spontaneous abortion in 104 (12.6%), in stillbirth in 1 (0.1%), and in other outcomes (induced abortion and ectopic pregnancy) in 10 (1.2%). A total of 96 of 104 spontaneous abortions (92.3%) occurred before 13 weeks of gestation ( ), and 700 of 712 pregnancies that resulted in a live birth (98.3%) were among persons who received their first eligible vaccine dose in the third trimester. Adverse outcomes among 724 live-born infants â€” including 12 sets of multiple gestation â€” were preterm birth (60 of 636 among those vaccinated before 37 weeks [9.4%]), small size for gestational age (23 of 724 [3.2%]), and major congenital anomalies (16 of 724 [2.2%]); no neonatal deaths were reported at the time of interview. Among the participants with completed pregnancies who reported congenital anomalies, none had received Covid-19 vaccine in the first trimester or periconception period, and no specific pattern of congenital anomalies was observed. Calculated proportions of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes appeared similar to incidences published in the peer-reviewed literature ( ). During the analysis period, the VAERS received and processed 221 reports involving Covid-19 vaccination among pregnant persons; 155 (70.1%) involved nonpregnancy-specific adverse events, and 66 (29.9%) involved pregnancy- or neonatal-specific adverse events (Table S4). The most frequently reported pregnancy-related adverse events were spontaneous abortion (46 cases; 37 in the first trimester, 2 in the second trimester, and 7 in which the trimester was unknown or not reported), followed by stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes, and vaginal bleeding, with 3 reports for each. No congenital anomalies were reported to the VAERS, a requirement under the EUAs. This U.S. surveillance review of the safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines during pregnancy and the periconception period indicates that some pregnant persons in the United States are choosing to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in all trimesters of pregnancy. Solicited local and systemic reactions that were reported to the v-safe surveillance system were similar among persons who identified as pregnant and nonpregnant women. Although not directly comparable, the proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (e.g., fetal loss, preterm birth, small size for gestational age, congenital anomalies, and neonatal death) among participants with completed pregnancies from the v-safe pregnancy registry appear to be similar to the published incidences in pregnant populations studied before the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many participants in the v-safe pregnancy registry were included in the phase 1a (highest) priority group for Covid-19 vaccination owing to their work as health care personnel.  V-safe participation is voluntary, and registration information is not uniformly available at all vaccination locations, although information about the surveillance system is included on the EUA fact sheets for health care providers and patients. Thus, comparisons of the proportions of vaccinated women with these outcomes to previously published estimates are limited by likely differences between these populations in age, ethnic group, and other social, demographic, and clinical characteristics that are known to be associated with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. However, such comparisons are helpful to provide a crude sense of whether there are any unexpected safety signals in these early data. At the time of this analysis, just 14.7% of persons who identified as pregnant in the v-safe surveillance system had been contacted to offer enrollment in the pregnancy registry. Other limitations should also be noted. As with all participant-reported surveillance systems, mistakes in completion of v-safe health surveys can result in misclassification of participants as pregnant; as a result, data for local and systemic reactions that participants reported to the v-safe platform may include some reports from nonpregnant persons. Participants are not required to complete surveys at the same time every day, and our ability to assess onset or duration of adverse events, such as fever, is limited. The registry data are preliminary, are from a small sample, and describe mostly neonatal outcomes from third-trimester vaccination; the findings may change as additional pregnancy outcomes are reported and the sample size increases, which may facilitate detection of rare outcomes. We were unable to evaluate adverse outcomes that might occur in association with exposures earlier in pregnancy, such as congenital anomalies, because no pregnant persons who were vaccinated early in pregnancy have had live births captured in the v-safe pregnancy registry to date; follow-up is ongoing. In addition, the proportion of pregnant persons who reported spontaneous abortion may not reflect true postvaccination proportions because participants might have been vaccinated after the period of greatest risk in the first trimester, and very early pregnancy losses might not be recognized. Whereas some pregnancies with vaccination in the first and early second trimester have been completed, the majority are ongoing, and a direct comparison of outcomes on the basis of timing of vaccination is needed to define the proportion of spontaneous abortions in this cohort. Because of sample-size constraints, both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were calculated as a proportion instead of a rate. Our preliminary analysis uses participant-reported data and has limited information on other potential risk factors for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. The VAERS is subject to the limitations of passive surveillance.  Despite EUA mandatory reporting requirements and CDC guidance on VAERS reporting, there is probably substantial underreporting of pregnancy- and neonatal-specific adverse events. We also do not know the total number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered to pregnant persons, which further limits our ability to estimate rates of reported adverse events from VAERS data. Among pregnancy-specific conditions reported to the VAERS after Covid-19 vaccination, miscarriage was the most common. This is similar to what was observed during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 after the introduction of the 2009 H1N1 inactivated influenza vaccine, where miscarriage was the most common adverse event reported by pregnant persons who received that vaccine. In addition to vaccination protecting women against Covid-19 and its complications during pregnancy, emerging evidence has shown transplacental transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies after maternal Covid-19 vaccination during the third trimester, which suggests that maternal vaccination might provide some level of protection to the neonate.  However, we do not have data on antibody transfer and level of protection relative to the timing of vaccination. The CDC and the FDA are continuing to monitor and disseminate information about the safety of mRNA and additional types of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. Early data from the v-safe surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the VAERS do not indicate any obvious safety signals with respect to pregnancy or neonatal outcomes associated with Covid-19 vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy. Continued monitoring is needed to further assess maternal, pregnancy, neonatal, and childhood outcomes associated with maternal Covid-19 vaccination, including in earlier stages of pregnancy and during the preconception period. Meanwhile, the present data can help inform decision making about vaccination by pregnant persons and their health care providers.  provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

Shown are the characteristics of v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age who identified as pregnant and who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine â€” BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) â€” from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. Race and ethnic group were reported by the participants. Questions about race and ethnic group were added to v-safe after launch of the platform; not all pregnancies had recorded race and ethnic group at the time of data analysis. Therefore, data on race and ethnic group were missing for 22.8% of the total number of participants who identified as pregnant (4932 participants receiving the Pfizerâ€“BioNTech vaccine and 3207 receiving the Moderna vaccine). 10.1056/NEJMoa2104983-t2 Frequency of Local and Systemic Reactions Reported on the Day after mRNA Covid-19 Vaccination in Pregnant Persons. Shown are solicited reactions in v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age who identified as pregnant and who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizerâ€“BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. 10.1056/NEJMoa2104983-t3 Characteristics of V-safe Pregnancy Registry Participants. Shown are registry participants who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizerâ€“BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. The v-safe pregnancy registry is only enrolling pregnant persons 18 years of age or older; at the time of this analysis, no participants were younger than 20 years of age. Race and ethnic group were reported by the participants. 10.1056/NEJMoa2104983-t4 Pregnancy Loss and Neonatal Outcomes in Published Studies and V-safe Pregnancy Registry Participants. The populations from which these rates are derived are not matched to the current study population for age, race and ethnic group, or other demographic and clinical factors. Data on pregnancy loss are based on 827 participants in the v-safe pregnancy registry who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizerâ€“BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, and who reported a completed pregnancy. A total of 700 participants (84.6%) received their first eligible dose in the third trimester. Data on neonatal outcomes are based on 724 live-born infants, including 12 sets of multiples. A total of 96 of 104 spontaneous abortions (92.3%) occurred before 13 weeks of gestation. The denominator includes live-born infants and stillbirths. The denominator includes only participants vaccinated before 37 weeks of gestation. Small size for gestational age indicates a birthweight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and infant sex according to INTERGROWTH-21  growth standards ( ). These standards draw from an international sample including both low-income and high-income countries but exclude children with coexisting conditions and malnutrition. They can be used as a standard for healthy children growing under optimal conditions. Values include only major congenital anomalies in accordance with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program 6-Digit Code Defect List ( ); all pregnancies with major congenital anomalies were exposed to Covid-19 vaccines only in the third trimester of pregnancy (i.e., well after the period of organogenesis). Neonatal death indicates death within the first 28 days after delivery. Shown are solicited reactions in pregnant persons and nonpregnant women 16 to 54 years of age who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine â€” BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) â€” from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. The percentage of respondents was calculated among those who completed a day 1 survey, with the top events shown of injection-site pain (pain), fatigue or tiredness (fatigue), headache, muscle or body aches (myalgia), chills, and fever or felt feverish (fever).

From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the â€œv-safe after vaccination health checkerâ€ surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases). Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes. The first coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines available in the United States were messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines: BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna). In December 2020, the vaccines were granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a two-dose series, 3 weeks apart for Pfizerâ€“BioNTech and 1 month apart for Moderna, and were recommended for use by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).  Pregnant persons were excluded from preauthorization clinical trials, and only limited human data on safety during pregnancy were available at the time of authorization. However, pregnant persons with Covid-19 are at increased risk for severe illness (e.g., resulting in admission to an intensive care unit, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mechanical ventilation) and death, as compared with nonpregnant persons of reproductive age.  Furthermore, pregnant persons with Covid-19 might be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, as compared with pregnant persons without Covid-19.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACIP, in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have issued guidance indicating that Covid-19 vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant persons. Postauthorization monitoring in pregnant persons is necessary to characterize the safety of these new Covid-19 vaccines, which use mRNA, lipid nanoparticles, and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes. Furthermore, establishing their safety profiles is critical to inform recommendations on maternal vaccination against Covid-19. We report preliminary findings of mRNA Covid-19 vaccine safety in pregnant persons from three U.S. vaccine safety monitoring systems: the â€œv-safe after vaccination health checkerâ€ surveillance system,  the v-safe pregnancy registry,  and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). V-safe is a new CDC smartphone-based active-surveillance system developed for the Covid-19 vaccination program; enrollment is voluntary. V-safe sends text messages to participants with weblinks to online surveys that assess for adverse reactions and health status during a postvaccination follow-up period. Follow-up continues 12 months after the final dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. During the first week after vaccination with any dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, participants are prompted to report local and systemic signs and symptoms during daily surveys and rank them as mild, moderate, or severe; surveys at all time points assess for events of adverse health effects. If participants indicate that they required medical care at any time point, they are asked to complete a report to the VAERS through active telephone outreach. To identify persons who received one or both Covid-19 vaccine doses while pregnant or who became pregnant after Covid-19 vaccination, v-safe surveys include pregnancy questions for persons who do not report their sex as male. Persons who identify as pregnant are then contacted by telephone and, if they meet inclusion criteria, are offered enrollment in the v-safe pregnancy registry. Eligible persons are those who received vaccination during pregnancy or in the periconception period (30 days before the last menstrual period through 14 days after) and are 18 years of age or older. For persons who choose to enroll, the pregnancy registry telephone-based survey collects detailed information about the participant, including medical and obstetric history, pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and contact information for obstetric and pediatric health care providers to obtain medical records; infants are followed through the first 3 months of life. Details about v-safe and v-safe pregnancy registry methods have been published previously. The VAERS is a national spontaneous-reporting (passive-surveillance) system established in 1990 that is administered by the CDC and the FDA.  Anyone can submit a report to the VAERS. Health care providers are required to report certain adverse events after vaccination, including pregnancy-related complications resulting in hospitalization and congenital anomalies, under the conditions of the EUAs for Covid-19 vaccines ; the CDC encourages reporting of any clinically significant maternal and infant adverse events. Signs and symptoms of adverse events are coded with the use of the   (MedDRA), version 23.1.  We used a pregnancy-status question in the VAERS form and a MedDRA code and text-string search to identify reports involving vaccination in pregnant persons. V-safe outcomes included participant-reported local and systemic reactogenicity to the BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) vaccine and the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine on the day after vaccination among all pregnant persons 16 to 54 years of age and among nonpregnant women 16 to 54 years of age as a comparator. For analysis of pregnancy outcomes in the v-safe pregnancy registry, data were restricted to completed pregnancies (i.e., live-born infant, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, or stillbirth). Participant-reported pregnancy outcomes included pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortion and stillbirth) and neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, congenital anomalies, small size for gestational age, and neonatal death) (Table S1 in the  , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). In the VAERS, outcomes included nonâ€“pregnancy-specific adverse events and pregnancy- and neonatal-specific adverse events. Demographic information and pregnancy characteristics are described for both v-safe and VAERS participants. Descriptive analyses were performed with the use of v-safe survey data for persons who identified as pregnant through February 28, 2021 (35,691 persons); persons enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry who were vaccinated through February 28, 2021 (3958 persons); and VAERS reports involving pregnant women received through February 28, 2021 (221 persons). Local and systemic reactogenicity was compared between persons who identified as pregnant and nonpregnant women. Descriptive analyses were conducted with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). All activities were reviewed by the CDC and were conducted in accordance with applicable federal law and CDC policy. From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, a total of 35,691 v-safe participants identified as pregnant. Age distributions were similar among the participants who received the Pfizerâ€“BioNTech vaccine and those who received the Moderna vaccine, with the majority of the participants being 25 to 34 years of age (61.9% and 60.6% for each vaccine, respectively) and non-Hispanic White (76.2% and 75.4%, respectively); most participants (85.8% and 87.4%, respectively) reported being pregnant at the time of vaccination ( ). Solicited reports of injection-site pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia were the most frequent local and systemic reactions after either dose for both vaccines ( ) and were reported more frequently after dose 2 for both vaccines. Participant-measured temperature at or above 38Â°C was reported by less than 1% of the participants on day 1 after dose 1 and by 8.0% after dose 2 for both vaccines. Shown are solicited reactions in pregnant persons and nonpregnant women 16 to 54 years of age who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine â€” BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) â€” from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. The percentage of respondents was calculated among those who completed a day 1 survey, with the top events shown of injection-site pain (pain), fatigue or tiredness (fatigue), headache, muscle or body aches (myalgia), chills, and fever or felt feverish (fever). These patterns of reporting, with respect to both most frequently reported solicited reactions and the higher reporting of reactogenicity after dose 2, were similar to patterns observed among nonpregnant women ( ). Small differences in reporting frequency between pregnant persons and nonpregnant women were observed for specific reactions (injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons, and other systemic reactions were reported more frequently among nonpregnant women), but the overall reactogenicity profile was similar. Pregnant persons did not report having severe reactions more frequently than nonpregnant women, except for nausea and vomiting, which were reported slightly more frequently only after dose 2 (Table S3). As of March 30, 2021, the v-safe pregnancy registry call center attempted to contact 5230 persons who were vaccinated through February 28, 2021, and who identified during a v-safe survey as pregnant at or shortly after Covid-19 vaccination. Of these, 912 were unreachable, 86 declined to participate, and 274 did not meet inclusion criteria (e.g., were never pregnant, were pregnant but received vaccination more than 30 days before the last menstrual period, or did not provide enough information to determine eligibility). The registry enrolled 3958 participants with vaccination from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, of whom 3719 (94.0%) identified as health care personnel. Among enrolled participants, most were 25 to 44 years of age (98.8%), non-Hispanic White (79.0%), and, at the time of interview, did not report a Covid-19 diagnosis during pregnancy (97.6%) ( ). Receipt of a first dose of vaccine meeting registry-eligibility criteria was reported by 92 participants (2.3%) during the periconception period, by 1132 (28.6%) in the first trimester of pregnancy, by 1714 (43.3%) in the second trimester, and by 1019 (25.7%) in the third trimester (1 participant was missing information to determine the timing of vaccination) ( ). Among 1040 participants (91.9%) who received a vaccine in the first trimester and 1700 (99.2%) who received a vaccine in the second trimester, initial data had been collected and follow-up scheduled at designated time points approximately 10 to 12 weeks apart; limited follow-up calls had been made at the time of this analysis. Among 827 participants who had a completed pregnancy, the pregnancy resulted in a live birth in 712 (86.1%), in a spontaneous abortion in 104 (12.6%), in stillbirth in 1 (0.1%), and in other outcomes (induced abortion and ectopic pregnancy) in 10 (1.2%). A total of 96 of 104 spontaneous abortions (92.3%) occurred before 13 weeks of gestation ( ), and 700 of 712 pregnancies that resulted in a live birth (98.3%) were among persons who received their first eligible vaccine dose in the third trimester. Adverse outcomes among 724 live-born infants â€” including 12 sets of multiple gestation â€” were preterm birth (60 of 636 among those vaccinated before 37 weeks [9.4%]), small size for gestational age (23 of 724 [3.2%]), and major congenital anomalies (16 of 724 [2.2%]); no neonatal deaths were reported at the time of interview. Among the participants with completed pregnancies who reported congenital anomalies, none had received Covid-19 vaccine in the first trimester or periconception period, and no specific pattern of congenital anomalies was observed. Calculated proportions of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes appeared similar to incidences published in the peer-reviewed literature ( ). During the analysis period, the VAERS received and processed 221 reports involving Covid-19 vaccination among pregnant persons; 155 (70.1%) involved nonpregnancy-specific adverse events, and 66 (29.9%) involved pregnancy- or neonatal-specific adverse events (Table S4). The most frequently reported pregnancy-related adverse events were spontaneous abortion (46 cases; 37 in the first trimester, 2 in the second trimester, and 7 in which the trimester was unknown or not reported), followed by stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes, and vaginal bleeding, with 3 reports for each. No congenital anomalies were reported to the VAERS, a requirement under the EUAs. This U.S. surveillance review of the safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines during pregnancy and the periconception period indicates that some pregnant persons in the United States are choosing to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in all trimesters of pregnancy. Solicited local and systemic reactions that were reported to the v-safe surveillance system were similar among persons who identified as pregnant and nonpregnant women. Although not directly comparable, the proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (e.g., fetal loss, preterm birth, small size for gestational age, congenital anomalies, and neonatal death) among participants with completed pregnancies from the v-safe pregnancy registry appear to be similar to the published incidences in pregnant populations studied before the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many participants in the v-safe pregnancy registry were included in the phase 1a (highest) priority group for Covid-19 vaccination owing to their work as health care personnel.  V-safe participation is voluntary, and registration information is not uniformly available at all vaccination locations, although information about the surveillance system is included on the EUA fact sheets for health care providers and patients. Thus, comparisons of the proportions of vaccinated women with these outcomes to previously published estimates are limited by likely differences between these populations in age, ethnic group, and other social, demographic, and clinical characteristics that are known to be associated with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. However, such comparisons are helpful to provide a crude sense of whether there are any unexpected safety signals in these early data. At the time of this analysis, just 14.7% of persons who identified as pregnant in the v-safe surveillance system had been contacted to offer enrollment in the pregnancy registry. Other limitations should also be noted. As with all participant-reported surveillance systems, mistakes in completion of v-safe health surveys can result in misclassification of participants as pregnant; as a result, data for local and systemic reactions that participants reported to the v-safe platform may include some reports from nonpregnant persons. Participants are not required to complete surveys at the same time every day, and our ability to assess onset or duration of adverse events, such as fever, is limited. The registry data are preliminary, are from a small sample, and describe mostly neonatal outcomes from third-trimester vaccination; the findings may change as additional pregnancy outcomes are reported and the sample size increases, which may facilitate detection of rare outcomes. We were unable to evaluate adverse outcomes that might occur in association with exposures earlier in pregnancy, such as congenital anomalies, because no pregnant persons who were vaccinated early in pregnancy have had live births captured in the v-safe pregnancy registry to date; follow-up is ongoing. In addition, the proportion of pregnant persons who reported spontaneous abortion may not reflect true postvaccination proportions because participants might have been vaccinated after the period of greatest risk in the first trimester, and very early pregnancy losses might not be recognized. Whereas some pregnancies with vaccination in the first and early second trimester have been completed, the majority are ongoing, and a direct comparison of outcomes on the basis of timing of vaccination is needed to define the proportion of spontaneous abortions in this cohort. Because of sample-size constraints, both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were calculated as a proportion instead of a rate. Our preliminary analysis uses participant-reported data and has limited information on other potential risk factors for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. The VAERS is subject to the limitations of passive surveillance.  Despite EUA mandatory reporting requirements and CDC guidance on VAERS reporting, there is probably substantial underreporting of pregnancy- and neonatal-specific adverse events. We also do not know the total number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered to pregnant persons, which further limits our ability to estimate rates of reported adverse events from VAERS data. Among pregnancy-specific conditions reported to the VAERS after Covid-19 vaccination, miscarriage was the most common. This is similar to what was observed during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 after the introduction of the 2009 H1N1 inactivated influenza vaccine, where miscarriage was the most common adverse event reported by pregnant persons who received that vaccine. In addition to vaccination protecting women against Covid-19 and its complications during pregnancy, emerging evidence has shown transplacental transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies after maternal Covid-19 vaccination during the third trimester, which suggests that maternal vaccination might provide some level of protection to the neonate.  However, we do not have data on antibody transfer and level of protection relative to the timing of vaccination. The CDC and the FDA are continuing to monitor and disseminate information about the safety of mRNA and additional types of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. Early data from the v-safe surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the VAERS do not indicate any obvious safety signals with respect to pregnancy or neonatal outcomes associated with Covid-19 vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy. Continued monitoring is needed to further assess maternal, pregnancy, neonatal, and childhood outcomes associated with maternal Covid-19 vaccination, including in earlier stages of pregnancy and during the preconception period. Meanwhile, the present data can help inform decision making about vaccination by pregnant persons and their health care providers.  provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

Obstet Gynecol       (Epub ahead of print). 10.1056/NEJMoa2104983-t1 Characteristics of Persons Who Identified as Pregnant in the V-safe Surveillance System and Received an mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine. Shown are the characteristics of v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age who identified as pregnant and who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine â€” BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) â€” from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. Race and ethnic group were reported by the participants. Questions about race and ethnic group were added to v-safe after launch of the platform; not all pregnancies had recorded race and ethnic group at the time of data analysis. Therefore, data on race and ethnic group were missing for 22.8% of the total number of participants who identified as pregnant (4932 participants receiving the Pfizerâ€“BioNTech vaccine and 3207 receiving the Moderna vaccine). 10.1056/NEJMoa2104983-t2 Frequency of Local and Systemic Reactions Reported on the Day after mRNA Covid-19 Vaccination in Pregnant Persons. Shown are solicited reactions in v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age who identified as pregnant and who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizerâ€“BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. 10.1056/NEJMoa2104983-t3 Characteristics of V-safe Pregnancy Registry Participants. Shown are registry participants who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizerâ€“BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. The v-safe pregnancy registry is only enrolling pregnant persons 18 years of age or older; at the time of this analysis, no participants were younger than 20 years of age. Race and ethnic group were reported by the participants. 10.1056/NEJMoa2104983-t4 Pregnancy Loss and Neonatal Outcomes in Published Studies and V-safe Pregnancy Registry Participants. The populations from which these rates are derived are not matched to the current study population for age, race and ethnic group, or other demographic and clinical factors. Data on pregnancy loss are based on 827 participants in the v-safe pregnancy registry who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizerâ€“BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, and who reported a completed pregnancy. A total of 700 participants (84.6%) received their first eligible dose in the third trimester. Data on neonatal outcomes are based on 724 live-born infants, including 12 sets of multiples. A total of 96 of 104 spontaneous abortions (92.3%) occurred before 13 weeks of gestation. The denominator includes live-born infants and stillbirths. The denominator includes only participants vaccinated before 37 weeks of gestation. Small size for gestational age indicates a birthweight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and infant sex according to INTERGROWTH-21  growth standards ( ). These standards draw from an international sample including both low-income and high-income countries but exclude children with coexisting conditions and malnutrition. They can be used as a standard for healthy children growing under optimal conditions. Values include only major congenital anomalies in accordance with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program 6-Digit Code Defect List ( ); all pregnancies with major congenital anomalies were exposed to Covid-19 vaccines only in the third trimester of pregnancy (i.e., well after the period of organogenesis). Neonatal death indicates death within the first 28 days after delivery. Shown are solicited reactions in pregnant persons and nonpregnant women 16 to 54 years of age who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine â€” BNT162b2 (Pfizerâ€“BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) â€” from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. The percentage of respondents was calculated among those who completed a day 1 survey, with the top events shown of injection-site pain (pain), fatigue or tiredness (fatigue), headache, muscle or body aches (myalgia), chills, and fever or felt feverish (fever).

In this preliminary description of pediatric U.S. COVID-19 cases, relatively few children with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and fewer children than adults experience fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Severe outcomes have been reported in children, including three deaths. Pediatric COVID-19 patients might not have fever or cough. Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups because patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission. As of April 2, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in >890,000 cases and >45,000 deaths worldwide, including 239,279 cases and 5,443 deaths in the United States ( , ). In the United States, 22% of the population is made up of infants, children, and adolescents aged <18 years (children) ( ). Data from China suggest that pediatric COVID-19 cases might be less severe than cases in adults and that children might experience different symptoms than do adults ( , ); however, disease characteristics among pediatric patients in the United States have not been described. Data from 149,760 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States occurring during February 12â€“April 2, 2020 were analyzed. Among 149,082 (99.6%) reported cases for which age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) were among children aged <18 years. Data were available for a small proportion of patients on many important variables, including symptoms (9.4%), underlying conditions (13%), and hospitalization status (33%). Among those with available information, 73% of pediatric patients had symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath compared with 93% of adults aged 18â€“64 years during the same period; 5.7% of all pediatric patients, or 20% of those for whom hospitalization status was known, were hospitalized, lower than the percentages hospitalized among all adults aged 18â€“64 years (10%) or those with known hospitalization status (33%). Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in this analysis. These data support previous findings that children with COVID-19 might not have reported fever or cough as often as do adults ( ). Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group. Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups as patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission ( , ). Data on COVID-19 cases were reported to CDC from 50 states, the District of Columbia, New York City, and four U.S territories. Jurisdictions voluntarily report data on laboratory-confirmed cases using a standardized case report form.* Data on cases occurring during February 12â€“April 2, 2020 and submitted through an electronic case-based COVID-19 surveillance database were reviewed for this report. Data submitted to CDC are preliminary and can be updated by health departments as more data become available. At the time of this analysis, characteristics of interest were available for only a minority of cases, including hospitalization status (33%), presence of preexisting underlying medical conditions (13%), and symptoms (9.4%). Because of the high percentage of cases with missing data and because cases with severe outcomes are more likely to have hospitalization or intensive care unit (ICU) status reported, percentages of patients hospitalized, including those admitted to the ICU, were estimated as a range, for which the denominator for the lower bound included cases with both known and unknown hospitalization or ICU status, and the upper bound included only cases with known hospitalization or ICU status. For other characteristics, percentages were calculated from among the number of cases with known information for that characteristic. Demographics of COVID-19 cases were assessed among cases in children aged <18 years and adults aged â‰¥18 years. Because clinical severity of COVID-19 is higher among adults aged â‰¥65 years than in younger age groups ( ), clinical features including symptoms and hospitalizations were assessed among adults aged 18â€“64 years and compared with those among the pediatric cases. Statistical comparisons were not performed because of the high percentage of missing data. As of April 2, 2020, data on 149,760 laboratory-confirmed U.S. COVID-19 cases were available for analysis. Among 149,082 (99.6%) cases for which patient age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) occurred in children aged <18 years and 146,510 (98%) in adults aged â‰¥18 years, including 113,985 (76%) aged 18â€“64 years. Among the 2,572 pediatric cases, 850 (33%) were reported from New York City; 584 (23%) from the rest of New York state; 393 (15%) from New Jersey; and the remaining 745 (29%) from other jurisdictions. The distribution of reporting jurisdictions for pediatric cases was similar to that of reporting jurisdictions for cases among adults aged â‰¥18 years, except that a lower percentage of adult cases was reported from New York state (14%). The first pediatric U.S. COVID-19 case was reported to CDC on March 2, 2020; since March 5, pediatric cases have been reported daily ( ). Among all 2,572 COVID-19 cases in children aged <18 years, the median age was 11 years (range 0â€“17 years). Nearly one third of reported pediatric cases (813; 32%) occurred in children aged 15â€“17 years, followed by those in children aged 10â€“14 years (682; 27%). Among younger children, 398 (15%) occurred in children aged <1 year, 291 (11%) in children aged 1â€“4 years, and 388 (15%) in children aged 5â€“9 years. Among 2,490 pediatric COVID-19 cases for which sex was known, 1,408 (57%) occurred in males; among cases in adults aged â‰¥18 years for which sex was known, 53% (75,450 of 143,414) were in males. Among 184 (7.2%) cases in children aged <18 years with known exposure information, 16 (9%) were associated with travel and 168 (91%) had exposure to a COVID-19 patient in the household or community. Data on signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were available for 291 of 2,572 (11%) pediatric cases and 10,944 of 113,985 (9.6%) cases among adults aged 18â€“64 years ( ). Whereas fever (subjective or documented), cough, and shortness of breath were commonly reported among adult patients aged 18â€“64 years (93% reported at least one of these), these signs and symptoms were less frequently reported among pediatric patients (73%). Among those with known information on each symptom, 56% of pediatric patients reported fever, 54% reported cough, and 13% reported shortness of breath, compared with 71%, 80%, and 43%, respectively, reporting these signs and symptoms among patients aged 18â€“64 years. Myalgia, sore throat, headache, and diarrhea were also less commonly reported by pediatric patients. Fifty-three (68%) of the 78 pediatric cases reported not to have fever, cough, or shortness of breath had no symptoms reported, but could not be classified as asymptomatic because of incomplete symptom information. One (1.3%) additional pediatric patient with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be asymptomatic. Information on hospitalization status was available for 745 (29%) cases in children aged <18 years and 35,061 (31%) cases in adults aged 18â€“64 years. Among children with COVID-19, 147 (estimated rangeÂ =Â 5.7%â€“20%) were reported to be hospitalized, with 15 (0.58%â€“2.0%) admitted to an ICU ( ). Among adults aged 18â€“64 years, the percentages of patients who were hospitalized (10%â€“33%), including those admitted to an ICU (1.4%â€“4.5%), were higher. Children aged <1 year accounted for the highest percentage (15%â€“62%) of hospitalization among pediatric patients with COVID-19. Among 95 children aged <1 year with known hospitalization status, 59 (62%) were hospitalized, including five who were admitted to an ICU. The percentage of patients hospitalized among those aged 1â€“17 years was lower (estimated rangeÂ =Â 4.1%â€“14%), with little variation among age groups (Figure 2). Among 345 pediatric cases with information on underlying conditions, 80 (23%) had at least one underlying condition. The most common underlying conditions were chronic lung disease (including asthma) (40), cardiovascular disease (25), and immunosuppression (10). Among the 295 pediatric cases for which information on both hospitalization status and underlying medical conditions was available, 28 of 37 (77%) hospitalized patients, including all six patients admitted to an ICU, had one or more underlying medical condition; among 258 patients who were not hospitalized, 30 (12%) patients had underlying conditions. Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in this analysis; however, review of these cases is ongoing to confirm COVID-19 as the likely cause of death. Among 149,082 U.S. cases of COVID-19 reported as of April 2, 2020, for which age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) occurred in patients aged <18 years. In comparison, persons aged <18 years account for 22% of the U.S. population ( ). Although infants <1 year accounted for 15% of pediatric COVID-19 cases, they remain underrepresented among COVID-19 cases in patients of all ages (393 of 149,082; 0.27%) compared with the percentage of the U.S. population aged <1 year (1.2%) ( ). Relatively few pediatric COVID-19 cases were hospitalized (5.7%â€“20%; including 0.58%â€“2.0% admitted to an ICU), consistent with previous reports that COVID-19 illness often might have a mild course among younger patients ( , ). Hospitalization was most common among pediatric patients aged <1 year and those with underlying conditions. In addition, 73% of children for whom symptom information was known reported the characteristic COVID-19 signs and symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. These findings are largely consistent with a report on pediatric COVID-19 patients aged <16 years in China, which found that only 41.5% of pediatric patients had fever, 48.5% had cough, and 1.8% were admitted to an ICU ( ). A second report suggested that although pediatric COVID-19 patients infrequently have severe outcomes, the infection might be more severe among infants ( ). In the current analysis, 59 of 147 pediatric hospitalizations, including five of 15 pediatric ICU admissions, were among children aged <1 year; however, most reported U.S. cases in infants had unknown hospitalization status. In this preliminary analysis of U.S. pediatric COVID-19 cases, a majority (57%) of patients were males. Several studies have reported a majority of COVID-19 cases among males ( , ), and an analysis of 44,000 COVID-19 cases in patients of all ages in China reported a higher case-fatality rate among men than among women ( ). However, the same report, as well as a separate analysis of 2,143 pediatric COVID-19 cases from China, detected no substantial difference in the number of cases among males and females ( , ). Reasons for any potential difference in COVID-19 incidence or severity between males and females are unknown. In the present analysis, the predominance of males in all pediatric age groups, including patients aged <1 year, suggests that biologic factors might play a role in any differences in COVID-19 susceptibility by sex. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because of the high workload associated with COVID-19 response activities on local, state, and territorial public health personnel, a majority of pediatric cases were missing data on disease symptoms, severity, or underlying conditions. Data for many variables are unlikely to be missing at random, and as such, these results must be interpreted with caution. Because of the high percentage of missing data, statistical comparisons could not be conducted. Second, because many cases occurred only days before publication of this report, the outcome for many patients is unknown, and this analysis might underestimate severity of disease or symptoms that manifested later in the course of illness. Third, COVID-19 testing practices differ across jurisdictions and might also differ across age groups. In many areas, prioritization of testing for severely ill patients likely occurs, which would result in overestimation of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection who are hospitalized (including those treated in an ICU) among all age groups. Finally, this analysis compares clinical characteristics of pediatric cases (persons aged <18 years) with those of cases among adults aged 18â€“64 years. Severe COVID-19 disease appears to be more common among adults at the high end of this age range ( ), and therefore cases in young adults might be more similar to those among children than suggested by the current analysis. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in many parts of the United States, it will be important to adapt COVID-19 surveillance strategies to maintain collection of critical case information without overburdening jurisdiction health departments. National surveillance will increasingly be complemented by focused surveillance systems collecting comprehensive case information on a subset of cases across various health care settings. These systems will provide detailed information on the evolving COVID-19 incidence and risk factors for infection and severe disease. More systematic and detailed collection of underlying condition data among pediatric patients would be helpful to understand which children might be at highest risk for severe COVID-19 illness. This preliminary examination of characteristics of COVID-19 disease among children in the United States suggests that children do not always have fever or cough as reported signs and symptoms. Although most cases reported among children to date have not been severe, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 infection in children and monitor for progression of illness, particularly among infants and children with underlying conditions. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution because of the high percentage of cases missing data on important characteristics. Because persons with asymptomatic and mild disease, including children, are likely playing a role in transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the community, social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors are recommended for persons of all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system from being overloaded, and protect older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions. Recommendations for reducing the spread of COVID-19 by staying at home and practicing strategies such as respiratory hygiene, wearing cloth face coverings when around others, and others are available on CDCâ€™s coronavirus website at  .

Because of the high percentage of cases with missing data and because cases with severe outcomes are more likely to have hospitalization or intensive care unit (ICU) status reported, percentages of patients hospitalized, including those admitted to the ICU, were estimated as a range, for which the denominator for the lower bound included cases with both known and unknown hospitalization or ICU status, and the upper bound included only cases with known hospitalization or ICU status. For other characteristics, percentages were calculated from among the number of cases with known information for that characteristic. Demographics of COVID-19 cases were assessed among cases in children aged <18 years and adults aged â‰¥18 years. Because clinical severity of COVID-19 is higher among adults aged â‰¥65 years than in younger age groups ( ), clinical features including symptoms and hospitalizations were assessed among adults aged 18â€“64 years and compared with those among the pediatric cases. Statistical comparisons were not performed because of the high percentage of missing data. As of April 2, 2020, data on 149,760 laboratory-confirmed U.S. COVID-19 cases were available for analysis. Among 149,082 (99.6%) cases for which patient age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) occurred in children aged <18 years and 146,510 (98%) in adults aged â‰¥18 years, including 113,985 (76%) aged 18â€“64 years. Among the 2,572 pediatric cases, 850 (33%) were reported from New York City; 584 (23%) from the rest of New York state; 393 (15%) from New Jersey; and the remaining 745 (29%) from other jurisdictions. The distribution of reporting jurisdictions for pediatric cases was similar to that of reporting jurisdictions for cases among adults aged â‰¥18 years, except that a lower percentage of adult cases was reported from New York state (14%). The first pediatric U.S. COVID-19 case was reported to CDC on March 2, 2020; since March 5, pediatric cases have been reported daily ( ). Among all 2,572 COVID-19 cases in children aged <18 years, the median age was 11 years (range 0â€“17 years). Nearly one third of reported pediatric cases (813; 32%) occurred in children aged 15â€“17 years, followed by those in children aged 10â€“14 years (682; 27%). Among younger children, 398 (15%) occurred in children aged <1 year, 291 (11%) in children aged 1â€“4 years, and 388 (15%) in children aged 5â€“9 years. Among 2,490 pediatric COVID-19 cases for which sex was known, 1,408 (57%) occurred in males; among cases in adults aged â‰¥18 years for which sex was known, 53% (75,450 of 143,414) were in males. Among 184 (7.2%) cases in children aged <18 years with known exposure information, 16 (9%) were associated with travel and 168 (91%) had exposure to a COVID-19 patient in the household or community. Data on signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were available for 291 of 2,572 (11%) pediatric cases and 10,944 of 113,985 (9.6%) cases among adults aged 18â€“64 years ( ). Whereas fever (subjective or documented), cough, and shortness of breath were commonly reported among adult patients aged 18â€“64 years (93% reported at least one of these), these signs and symptoms were less frequently reported among pediatric patients (73%). Among those with known information on each symptom, 56% of pediatric patients reported fever, 54% reported cough, and 13% reported shortness of breath, compared with 71%, 80%, and 43%, respectively, reporting these signs and symptoms among patients aged 18â€“64 years. Myalgia, sore throat, headache, and diarrhea were also less commonly reported by pediatric patients. Fifty-three (68%) of the 78 pediatric cases reported not to have fever, cough, or shortness of breath had no symptoms reported, but could not be classified as asymptomatic because of incomplete symptom information. One (1.3%) additional pediatric patient with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be asymptomatic. Information on hospitalization status was available for 745 (29%) cases in children aged <18 years and 35,061 (31%) cases in adults aged 18â€“64 years. Among children with COVID-19, 147 (estimated rangeÂ =Â 5.7%â€“20%) were reported to be hospitalized, with 15 (0.58%â€“2.0%) admitted to an ICU ( ). Among adults aged 18â€“64 years, the percentages of patients who were hospitalized (10%â€“33%), including those admitted to an ICU (1.4%â€“4.5%), were higher. Children aged <1 year accounted for the highest percentage (15%â€“62%) of hospitalization among pediatric patients with COVID-19. Among 95 children aged <1 year with known hospitalization status, 59 (62%) were hospitalized, including five who were admitted to an ICU. The percentage of patients hospitalized among those aged 1â€“17 years was lower (estimated rangeÂ =Â 4.1%â€“14%), with little variation among age groups (Figure 2). Among 345 pediatric cases with information on underlying conditions, 80 (23%) had at least one underlying condition. The most common underlying conditions were chronic lung disease (including asthma) (40), cardiovascular disease (25), and immunosuppression (10). Among the 295 pediatric cases for which information on both hospitalization status and underlying medical conditions was available, 28 of 37 (77%) hospitalized patients, including all six patients admitted to an ICU, had one or more underlying medical condition; among 258 patients who were not hospitalized, 30 (12%) patients had underlying conditions. Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in this analysis; however, review of these cases is ongoing to confirm COVID-19 as the likely cause of death. Among 149,082 U.S. cases of COVID-19 reported as of April 2, 2020, for which age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) occurred in patients aged <18 years. In comparison, persons aged <18 years account for 22% of the U.S. population ( ). Although infants <1 year accounted for 15% of pediatric COVID-19 cases, they remain underrepresented among COVID-19 cases in patients of all ages (393 of 149,082; 0.27%) compared with the percentage of the U.S. population aged <1 year (1.2%) ( ). Relatively few pediatric COVID-19 cases were hospitalized (5.7%â€“20%; including 0.58%â€“2.0% admitted to an ICU), consistent with previous reports that COVID-19 illness often might have a mild course among younger patients ( , ). Hospitalization was most common among pediatric patients aged <1 year and those with underlying conditions. In addition, 73% of children for whom symptom information was known reported the characteristic COVID-19 signs and symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. These findings are largely consistent with a report on pediatric COVID-19 patients aged <16 years in China, which found that only 41.5% of pediatric patients had fever, 48.5% had cough, and 1.8% were admitted to an ICU ( ). A second report suggested that although pediatric COVID-19 patients infrequently have severe outcomes, the infection might be more severe among infants ( ). In the current analysis, 59 of 147 pediatric hospitalizations, including five of 15 pediatric ICU admissions, were among children aged <1 year; however, most reported U.S. cases in infants had unknown hospitalization status. In this preliminary analysis of U.S. pediatric COVID-19 cases, a majority (57%) of patients were males. Several studies have reported a majority of COVID-19 cases among males ( , ), and an analysis of 44,000 COVID-19 cases in patients of all ages in China reported a higher case-fatality rate among men than among women ( ). However, the same report, as well as a separate analysis of 2,143 pediatric COVID-19 cases from China, detected no substantial difference in the number of cases among males and females ( , ). Reasons for any potential difference in COVID-19 incidence or severity between males and females are unknown. In the present analysis, the predominance of males in all pediatric age groups, including patients aged <1 year, suggests that biologic factors might play a role in any differences in COVID-19 susceptibility by sex. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because of the high workload associated with COVID-19 response activities on local, state, and territorial public health personnel, a majority of pediatric cases were missing data on disease symptoms, severity, or underlying conditions. Data for many variables are unlikely to be missing at random, and as such, these results must be interpreted with caution. Because of the high percentage of missing data, statistical comparisons could not be conducted. Second, because many cases occurred only days before publication of this report, the outcome for many patients is unknown, and this analysis might underestimate severity of disease or symptoms that manifested later in the course of illness. Third, COVID-19 testing practices differ across jurisdictions and might also differ across age groups. In many areas, prioritization of testing for severely ill patients likely occurs, which would result in overestimation of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection who are hospitalized (including those treated in an ICU) among all age groups. Finally, this analysis compares clinical characteristics of pediatric cases (persons aged <18 years) with those of cases among adults aged 18â€“64 years. Severe COVID-19 disease appears to be more common among adults at the high end of this age range ( ), and therefore cases in young adults might be more similar to those among children than suggested by the current analysis. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in many parts of the United States, it will be important to adapt COVID-19 surveillance strategies to maintain collection of critical case information without overburdening jurisdiction health departments. National surveillance will increasingly be complemented by focused surveillance systems collecting comprehensive case information on a subset of cases across various health care settings. These systems will provide detailed information on the evolving COVID-19 incidence and risk factors for infection and severe disease. More systematic and detailed collection of underlying condition data among pediatric patients would be helpful to understand which children might be at highest risk for severe COVID-19 illness. This preliminary examination of characteristics of COVID-19 disease among children in the United States suggests that children do not always have fever or cough as reported signs and symptoms. Although most cases reported among children to date have not been severe, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 infection in children and monitor for progression of illness, particularly among infants and children with underlying conditions. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution because of the high percentage of cases missing data on important characteristics. Because persons with asymptomatic and mild disease, including children, are likely playing a role in transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the community, social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors are recommended for persons of all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system from being overloaded, and protect older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions. Recommendations for reducing the spread of COVID-19 by staying at home and practicing strategies such as respiratory hygiene, wearing cloth face coverings when around others, and others are available on CDCâ€™s coronavirus website at  .

Date of report available starting February 24, 2020; reported cases include any with onset on or after February 12, 2020. *Cases were included in the denominator if they had a known symptom status for fever, cough, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Total number of patients by age group: <18 years (N = 2,572), 18â€“64 years (N = 113,985).  Includes all cases with one or more of these symptoms.  Patients were included if they had information for either measured or subjective fever variables and were considered to have a fever if â€œyesâ€ was indicated for either variable.  Runny nose and abdominal pain were less frequently completed than other symptoms; therefore, percentages with these symptoms are likely underestimates.

Kennedy Jr. Win and was Mandatory Vaccination Abolished in the U.S? \n"," 20 April, 2021 Share: \n"," Social media users are still actively sharing the   uploaded by TV host Madona Koidze on August 14, 2020, in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an American anti-vaccine advocate and environmental lawyer, who is the nephew of former U.S. president John F. Kennedy, speaks about vaccines during an American talk show  . Kennedy recollects failed attempts of creating vaccines against SARS-Cov, respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) viruses and dengue fever, saying that vaccines against these diseases had caused “enhanced immune response.” He claims that the novel coronavirus vaccines may pose the same threat, noting that such doubts are further strengthened by the fact that Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, allowed vaccine manufacturers to skip animal trials and to go directly to human trials. Madona Koidze’s post was again shared on April 7, 2021. Two Facebook users    and   shared it with identical captions, reading that in 2017, the White House appointed Robert Kennedy as a chair of the commission to review vaccine safety and that he won a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) after he proved that no monitoring of vaccine safety had been conducted for over 32 years.     and Georgian anti-vaccination doctor,   also spread the posts about Robert Kennedy allegedly winning the lawsuit on vaccination. According to Giorgobiani’s post, Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci and the pharmaceutical companies lost the lawsuit because they failed to prove that the vaccines used in the United States over past 32 years were safe and consequently, the U.S. Supreme Court abolished universal vaccination. Tina Topuria spreads identical information referring to the article published on  . The New York District Court adopted its decision picked up by social media users in July 2018 after Robert F. Kennedy and Informed Consent Action Network ( ), an anti-vaccine organization, filed a   against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for violating the Freedom of Information Act. According to the lawsuit, ICAN requested the U.S. Department of Health to provide the copies of vaccine safety reports, but failed to receive public information for several months. The same lawsuit   that the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) developed in 1986 requires HHS to submit biennial reports to two Congressional Committees detailing the improvements in vaccine safety made by HHS in the preceding two years. In response to ICAN’s request, HHS noted that it could not find the requested reports. Based on this official response received from HHS, ICAN   that the Department of Health has not conducted safety monitoring for over 30 years.   In an   on April 28, 2019, journalist Jackie Kucinich found out what happened to the reports HHS did not provide. At a March 2019 hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Chairman Lamar Alexander said the reports were actually required within two years of the law’s implementation, not every two years. And, Alexander said, the HELP Committee has two reports from the Department submitted to Congress in  , and in  . Both of these reports were made public at Senator Alexander’s request in 2019.  HHS regularly conducts vaccine safety monitoring through various subordinate units. So, claiming the opposite based on this lawsuit only is a manipulation. For example, upon instructions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, several medical institutions and research centers prepare detailed vaccine safety   that are submitted to HHS. In 2014, the latter also prepared a   on safety of vaccines used for routine immunization in the United States. In addition, four HHS-subordinated committees are independently working on vaccine safety monitoring, among them   Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ), National Vaccine Advisory Committee ( ) and the Advisory Committee on Childhood Vaccines. All of these committees have independent experts, who constantly monitor vaccine safety at different stages and submit information to HHS. Moreover, four monitoring systems also   vaccine safety in the United States.  Neither Bill Gates nor Anthony Fauci are featuring in the case of ICAN and HHS. Furthermore, the court dispute was not about abolition of mandatory vaccination. There are several   decisions in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court, when citizens were demanding abolition of mandatory vaccination, but the court rejected their lawsuits. In the video spread on social media Kennedy speaks about the vaccines that caused an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the past, claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines pose the same threat. However, his claims   scientific evidence. The antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is developed when a human initially suffers from mild symptoms, but in case of reinfection gets much sicker. ADE is typical for some respiratory viruses; therefore, theoretically, it is possible for SARS-Cov-2 to   this disease. However, current empirical data about the virus and vaccines do not confirm that any approved COVID-19 vaccine will cause “enhanced immune response” or generally, COVID-19 has such effects on human bodies.  Identical claims about the coronavirus vaccines were also spread earlier. See details in Myth Detector’s article:  .  Kennedy echoes another popular disinformation about the coronavirus vaccines, according to which Anthony Fauci allowed vaccine manufacturers to skip animal trials and to go directly to human trials. In fact, the approved COVID-19 vaccines have   through all phases of animal and human trials. Myth Detector wrote about it in its earlier articles:        Jr. is an American anti-vaccine advocate, conspiracy theorist, author, and environmental lawyer. In 2016, Kennedy founded  , an anti-vaccine and pseudoscience advocacy group, that may publish unverifiable information that is not always supported by evidence. According to the   released in January 2020, the organization founded by Kennedy accounted for 54% of anti-vaccine advertising content on Facebook. Robert Kennedy himself gained popularity among anti-vaccine groups by spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines through his Facebook and Twitter accounts. According to the   released by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) in March 2021, Kennedy is one of those 12 anti-vaccine influencers who regularly spread disinformation about vaccines and generate two thirds of anti-vaccination content on Facebook and Twitter.  Robert Kennedy   American media in 2017 that Donald Trump offered him the chairmanship of a commission that will examine “vaccination safety and scientific integrity” – something that triggered strong outcry from the scientific community, because Kennedy was voicing that scientists have repeatedly determined to be without merit. Despite his promise, Donald Trump abandoned the plan to set up the commission and even   talks with Kennedy on the issue. The article has been written in the framework of Facebook’s fact-checking  .
