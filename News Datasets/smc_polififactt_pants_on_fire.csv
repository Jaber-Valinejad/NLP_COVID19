Lauren Boebert","Texas has recorded COVID deaths since removing its mask mandate — thousands of them




U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican of Colorado, invoked Gov. Greg Abbott's repeal of the state's mask mandate to illustrate how Republicans, and not Democrats, are basing COVID-19 policies on science.  
During a May 19 interview on Dr. Gina Prime Time with host Gina Loudon, a conservative TV personality on the web-based network Real America’s Voice and former campaign surrogate for President Donald Trump, Boebert and Loudon blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., over Democrats' mask rules 
House rules state that, until all members and staff are fully vaccinated, masks are required on the House floor and in committee meeting rooms, with fines of $500 for the first offense and $2,500 for the second offense, Politico reported.  
As of May 14, all House Democrats reported having received a COVID-19 vaccine. Ninety-five of the 212 Republican House members reported being vaccinated, with 112 Republicans not responding to a survey, according to CNN. 
Boebert was one of many House Republicans who joined a maskless protest within the House chamber alongside a dozen other members, including Texas representatives Chip Roy, Beth Van Duyne and Louie Gohmert, according to Politico. Their protest argued that leaving the mask-wearing rules in place contravened the latest guidelines released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which eased face covering guidelines for vaccinated people.
""It just goes to show that this party’s ‘follow the science’ slogan is a total joke,"" Boebert said. 
Then she referenced Abbott's move to lift the statewide mask rules effective March 10 as part of an effort to ""open Texas 100%."" 
""Texas removed their mask mandate two months ago, and sleepy Joe called it Neanderthal thinking,"" she said. ""No sir. Republicans are just following the science. And since removing the mask mandate two months ago, Texas has not reported a single COVID death. Not one.""

A look at the state’s COVID-19 dashboard shows that, although daily fatality numbers are decreasing, more than 3,000 Texans have died of the coronavirus since the mask mandate was lifted. That’s about 6% of the 50,000 deaths Texas has recorded since the beginning of the pandemic. 

This total also does not include fatalities from May 23 to date, which have not yet been recorded by the state. And totals from May 10 onward are still trickling in because, according to a Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson, it takes around 10 days, on average, for funeral homes and medical officials to submit death certificates.  
About 34% of Texans, or around 9.9 million people, have been fully vaccinated, according to state data. Health officials have said that between 75% and 95% of the state population need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity.  
Boebert represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which comprises the western swath of the state, home to a smattering of ski resorts, national forest, ranches and coal-mining towns, according to the Associated Press. Boebert defeated longstanding Republican Rep. Scott Tipton in 2020 after accusing Tipton of not being sufficiently pro-Trump. Her far-right views are centered around gun rights, and she owns a restaurant where servers openly carry firearms. 
Her spokesperson, Ben Stout, did not respond to requests for comment.  
Our ruling 
Boebert said during a May 19 interview with Gina Loudon that, since Texas removed its mask mandate, the state ""has not reported a single COVID death. Not one."" 
A quick look at the state-run COVID-19 dashboard, which tracks coronavirus cases, deaths and other metrics, shows that more than 3,000 Texans have died of COVID-19 since Abbott lifted the mandate on March 10.

Facebook posts","No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths




If Your Time is short





President Donald Trump retweeted multiple posts that falsely claimed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decreased the number of U.S. coronavirus deaths to 9,210.


Those posts misconstrue data from the CDC, which shows that the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients who have comorbidities like influenza or pneumonia.


As of Aug. 31, the CDC reported that 182,622 Americans have died since the start of the pandemic. Some estimates put the death toll even higher.





See the sources for this fact-check




Over the weekend, President Donald Trump shared two posts that falsely claimed COVID-19 deaths are not as high as previously thought. 
The posts claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its COVID-19 death numbers to show that only 9,210 Americans have died from the virus. Twitter removed the first tweet for violating its rules. Another post from Jenna Ellis, a senior legal adviser for the Trump campaign, linked to a story from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative news site. That tweet was still up as of publication.

The tweets misconstrue federal data on COVID-19 victims.
As of Aug. 31, the CDC reported that 182,622 Americans have died since the start of the pandemic — and some estimates put the death toll even higher. The agency told us that the vast majority of deaths involving COVID-19 can be attributed to the virus. 
Claims that the CDC adjusted its COVID-19 death numbers appear to have originated on Facebook before making their way to Trump’s Twitter feed, according to VineSight, an organization that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. Several posts have been shared thousands of times.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
""CDC just backpedaled (quietly) and adjusted the US Covid deaths from 153,504 to 9,210,"" said Amiri King, a social media influencer and CBD salesman, in an Aug. 31 post that shows a screenshot of King’s tweet, which was also deleted. ""Admitting that their numbers were so f---ed that they were off by a whopping 94%.""
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Posts misconstrue CDC data
The social media posts trace back to an Aug. 26 update from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the CDC. The report is updated every Wednesday and outlines provisional death counts for COVID-19.
In his post, King cited an older version of a data table about deaths from COVID-19 in combination with other conditions, such as pneumonia and influenza.
In a section titled ""Comorbidities,"" the NCHS wrote: ""For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.""
That data comes from death certificates.
King cited an older version of the NCHS report that analyzed 153,504 deaths involving COVID-19. Six percent of that figure is 9,210. 
To some readers, the report may appear to confirm his math. But it doesn’t.

In medicine, comorbidities are conditions that patients experience in tandem with a primary condition. According to the CDC, people with preexisting conditions like cancer and diabetes are more at risk of death if they contract the coronavirus.
The NCHS report shows that the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients with comorbidities. But that doesn’t mean COVID-19 wasn’t a factor.
""A small number of people have COVID ascribed as the sole cause of death. It may be they had no comorbidities or they were just not noted,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""However, it is also clear that advanced age and several other underlying diseases lead to bad outcomes with COVID infections. The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID."" 
In a Facebook post addressing claims about the NCHS report, Dr. Mark Halstead, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery and pediatrics at Washington University, broke down how conditions are listed on a patient’s death certificate.
RELATED: Don’t trust this comparison of daily coronavirus deaths with other diseases
""So, let's say someone was admitted to the hospital because of symptoms of COVID. They test positive, so COVID would be listed,"" Halstead said in the post. ""Their case progressed where they developed respiratory failure and now are on a ventilator. Respiratory failure can be listed.""
Additional conditions may be listed on a patient’s death certificate during the course of their stay in the hospital. For example, if a COVID-19 patient ended up dying from cardiac arrest, that could also be included.
""So now three things are listed on their death certificate,"" Halstead wrote. ""The COVID infection started the process but that led to the heart and lungs failing, which killed that person.""
Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS, told us in an email that while 94% of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also listed other conditions, the underlying cause of death was COVID-19 in almost all of them.
""The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,"" he said. ""In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death.""
We reached out to King for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that the CDC decreased the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. from 153,504 to 9,210.
That’s wrong. As of Aug. 31, the CDC counted 182,622 Americans who had died because of the coronavirus.
A NCHS report found that, for about 6% of Americans who die from the virus, COVID-19 is the only condition listed on their death certificates. But that doesn’t mean the remaining 94% didn’t die due to the coronavirus.
People with preexisting conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, have a higher risk of dying if they contract COVID-19. Complications from those conditions, as well as comorbidities like influenza and pneumonia, can be listed in addition to the coronavirus on death certificates. In 92% of death certificates that mention the virus, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, according to the NCHS.

Facebook posts","Don’t trust this comparison of daily coronavirus deaths with other diseases




If Your Time is short




 The post used March 9 as its date for coronavirus deaths, which was right before deaths soared. Subsequent daily totals show that coronavirus deaths have become larger than any other disease on the list.

 
The coronavirus spreads through the air, there is no vaccine or treatment, and by now it’s established itself in most countries. So in many cases, limiting casual contact between people, including by economic shutdowns, may be the only effective way of stopping the virus’ spread.




See the sources for this fact-check




A social media post says the novel coronavirus causes a small number of deaths compared with other diseases, essentially arguing that the coronavirus shouldn’t have forced such widespread economic shutdowns.
The July 8 post is headlined, ""Disease deaths per day worldwide."" In a bar chart, the post lists more than two dozen communicable diseases, along with what it says are the number of worldwide deaths per day for each.
According to the chart, the top five killers are tuberculosis (3,014 deaths), hepatitis B (2,430), pneumonia (2,216), HIV/AIDS (2,110), and malaria (2,002).
About two-thirds of the way to the bottom of the list is the coronavirus, with just 56 daily deaths. Punctuated by a big red arrow, the post says, ""THIS is what collapsed the world economy.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
We found that the post (seen below) is highly misleading. Here are some big problems with it.

 
The number of coronavirus deaths is cherry-picked to be low
We researched the number of deaths from each of the diseases in the post and found some variation. But they were usually in the ballpark — except for COVID-19.
Usually, cause-of-death data is released a couple of years after the fact and is subject to estimation. But coronavirus is such an urgent health threat, deaths are tabulated on a daily basis with a much smaller lag.
In tiny type, the post cites data as of March 9, 2020. That was just before coronavirus deaths began their exponential growth — and just before U.S. communities started to shut down schools and restrict public gatherings to prevent its further spread.
On March 9, the seven-day rolling average for worldwide coronavirus deaths was 130. (It’s unclear where the 56 deaths cited in the post came from.) By April 18, the peak to date, the seven-day rolling average was 7,036. By July 12, the number had dropped to 4,945, but that was still far higher than the 56 deaths claimed in the post.
We re-did the chart based on the best available data, including those three options for coronavirus deaths, marked in red:

 
Both the April or July numbers for COVID-19 deaths are larger than for any of the other diseases. The closest is tuberculosis, with 3,452 deaths.
""The original figure is incredibly misleading, especially if still being circulated today,"" said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Unlike for most of the other diseases on this list, ""it needs to be pointed out that we have not yet had one year’s experience"" with the virus to have an accurate count and to understand the disease’s dynamics over time, said Nicole Gatto, associate professor in the School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University. It’s too early, she said, ""to fairly compare with these other causes of death.""
In all, then, the notion that coronavirus is causing a piddling number of deaths is bunk.
Most of the other diseases have effective treatments or vaccines
There’s not yet an effective drug or vaccine for coronavirus. That’s also the case for a few of the other diseases on the list, including norovirus, dengue fever, Ebola, SARS, and MERS.
For most of the diseases on the list, however, we do have one or more effective tools. 
Vaccines exist for hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, seasonal flu, whooping cough, typhoid, cholera, meningitis, measles, rabies, yellow fever, and chicken pox, Nichols said.
Effective treatments are available for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and malaria has an effective prophylaxis.
But for COVID-19, not having an effective vaccine or treatment means that the only tool is to limit personal contact and maintain good hygiene. Doing this makes economic shutdowns a much more urgent tool for the coronavirus than for any of the other diseases on the list.
Many of the other diseases are not spread as easily through the air
While tuberculosis, measles, pneumonia, the seasonal flu, whooping cough, SARS, and MERS are spread by respiratory pathways, most of the others do not. 
They may spread through contaminated food or water, such as cholera; or bodily fluids, like HIV/AIDS; or animal vectors, such as malaria or rabies.
Since respiratory diseases are particularly hard to control, they are more likely to require significant disruptions, such as economic shutdowns. You wouldn’t need a broad-scale economic shutdown to prevent HIV/AIDS, because it doesn’t spread through casual contact. For most of the other diseases on the list, you would mainly need a robust public health system.
Coronavirus is now endemic almost everywhere
Some of the other diseases on this list aren’t apples to apples because they’re regional. 
Malaria and dengue are carried by certain types of mosquito, so if you don’t live near the mosquitoes, you won’t get the disease. The parasite that causes leishmaniasis tends to be found only in certain areas. For other diseases, many wealthier countries have been able to vaccinate to a level of herd immunity, reducing the risk of catching the illness in those places even if you’re unvaccinated.
By contrast, the coronavirus spread within months to nearly everywhere in the world.
Our ruling
The post said that only 56 coronavirus deaths a day was enough to collapse the world economy, even though thousands of people die daily from tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and other diseases.
For starters, the post chose March 9 as its date for coronavirus deaths, which was right before deaths soared. Subsequent daily totals show that coronavirus deaths have become larger than any other disease on the list.
In addition, coronavirus poses special risks that may need to be ameliorated by economic closures. It spreads through the air, there is no vaccine or treatment, and by now it’s established itself in most countries, so in many cases, limiting casual contact between people may be the only effective way of stopping the virus’ spread.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump’s wrong claim that ‘anybody’ can get tested for coronavirus




If Your Time is short





The CDC says health care providers are the ones who decide whether someone gets tested for coronavirus.


Factors clinicians should consider include whether individuals were in close contact with a lab-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptom onset, or traveled from affected geographic areas within 14 days of symptom onset.


Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.


 



See the sources for this fact-check




To show that his administration has been fast and effective in its response to the new coronavirus, President Donald Trump claimed that anybody who wants to get tested for the respiratory disease caused by the virus can do so.
""Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what the bottom line is,"" Trump told reporters March 6 during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
Moments later, Trump added that anybody that needs a test gets one.
""But as of right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test — that’s the important thing — and the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right? This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good,"" Trump said. (Trump’s mention of ""the letter"" and ""transcription"" was a reference to his recent impeachment.)
As large public gatherings around the United States are being cancelled and some colleges are suspending in-person classes to avoid the spread of the disease, PolitiFact decided to fact-check Trump on his ""bottom line"" assessment that anybody who wants a test will get one.
He’s wrong. Current supply of the test is limited, and it is clinicians who decide whether a patient meets criteria to warrant testing. Testing is not as easy as just calling your doctor or pharmacy, saying you want to be tested for COVID-19 and getting it done.
""Unfortunately, it’s not that simple yet,"" said Christopher Mores, a professor of global health at George Washington University.
There is greater availability of tests, but the number of labs involved in the testing process is still limited, Mores said. Testing is expected to increase as more commercial labs participate, but even they have limits in the number of patients that can be tested daily, Mores said.
PolitiFact found news reports of people who wanted to get tested and couldn’t, or of hindrances in the testing process. Here’s a sample:


CBS Miami reported March 2 that a woman who had returned from Italy was told at a hospital that she likely had COVID-19 but was refused a test. The woman, not named by CBS Miami, said one of the reasons she wasn’t tested for the new coronavirus was because she was not in a high-risk category, since she was in her 30s and otherwise healthy. (She tested positive for earlier coronavirus strains, coronavirus 229E and NL63, according to CBS Miami.) The hospital and state health department did not comment on the case.


Texas Tribune reported March 11 that Texas’ largest public health lab can do a maximum of 26 tests per day. Doctors and hospitals did not yet have capability to do tests on their own premises. (An NPR report indicates this issue is not limited to Texas.)


The Mercury News reported that the president of the California Academy of Family Physicians said no one had been trained to do the test. (The story published March 7 and was updated March 10.)

CDC says health care providers decide who gets tested for COVID-19
The CDC on its website said that if people come in close contact of someone with the respiratory disease and they develop symptoms, they should call their health care provider.
""They will decide whether you need to be tested, but keep in mind that there is no treatment for COVID-19, and people who are mildly ill are able to isolate at home,"" the federal health agency said.
Elsewhere on its website, the CDC said, ""Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested."" 
Factors to consider for testing include whether individuals were in close contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptoms, or if they traveled from affected geographic areas within 14 days of symptom onset. 
Clinicians who want to test a patient should work with local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health labs, CDC said. That process could be delayed if the labs are running at capacity.
Limited number of tests 
The CDC is typically the first one to develop a diagnostic test because they have access before others to clinical specimens and viral samples. The CDC test then becomes the basis for tests developed by others. But there were manufacturing problems with the CDC test at first.
Trump administration officials have provided conflicting information regarding how many people can be tested. Stephen M. Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, acknowledged the confusion on March 7.
Hahn said that production issues were eventually resolved by a third-party manufacturer. That manufacturer is producing tests for state public health labs, academic medical centers, community hospitals and other nonpublic health labs.
The CDC has shipped tests to public health laboratories to test about 75,000 people, Hahn said. Additionally, 1.1 million tests were shipped to nonpublic health labs, and around 1 million more tests were close to being shipped, he said.
But the number of tests shipped doesn’t equal the number of people that can be tested. For instance, 2.1 million tests would roughly translate to testing for 850,000 Americans, according to Hahn.
Manufacturers plan to scale up production so they can ship 4 million more tests by mid March, Hahn said, and large commercial and academic labs are also expected to make more tests.
Our ruling
Trump said, ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test.""
This is wrong. It is health care providers who make the call on who gets tested, based on recommendations from the CDC. There’s an increase in the number of tests being manufactured, but an increase in the availability of tests does not mean that ""anybody that wants a test can get a test.""

J. Bart Classen","The coronavirus vaccine doesn’t cause Alzheimer’s, ALS




If Your Time is short





Classen’s paper presents no evidence other than a three-sentence methods section that summarizes an unspecified analysis of the COVID-19 vaccine.


Coronavirus vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have not been linked to neurodegenerative or prion diseases.





See the sources for this fact-check




A research article making the rounds online claims that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause diseases like Alzheimer’s. Don’t believe it.
In the article, published in the journal Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in January, J. Bart Classen wrote that components of the coronavirus vaccines may cause the misfolding of proteins associated with Alzheimer’s and Lou Gehrig’s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
""The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit,"" Classen said in the paper.
The article was surfaced to PolitiFact by VineSight, a firm that tracks online misinformation. It has been shared widely on social media and blogs that advocate against vaccines, so we wanted to take a closer look.

The research article is baseless — there is no evidence that the coronavirus vaccine causes Alzheimer’s, ALS or prion diseases. When we reached out to Classen for a comment, he said his paper ""speaks for itself.""
Microbiology & Infectious Diseases is hosted by SciVision, a platform for open-access journals that librarian Jeffrey Beall listed as a potential predatory publisher aimed at profiting from academics instead of offering rigorous peer review. Classen has previously published research falsely linking vaccines to diabetes. He speculates on his website that the coronavirus pandemic ""is actually a bioweapon attack and may be linked to the U.S. anthrax attack of 2001.""
He also included that claim — which PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked — in the body of his research article.
Putting the bogus bioweapon claim aside, let’s take a closer look at Classen’s paper.
Prion diseases are a family of rare neurodegenerative disorders. They’re caused by pathogens called prions, which can cause abnormal folding of proteins most commonly found in the brain. One example is mad cow disease, a brain disorder in cattle that can spread to humans through infected meat.

The coronavirus vaccines use a new but well-researched technology called mRNA, which tells the body how to produce copies of the protein on the surface of the virus without infecting the patient. In his paper, Classen says mRNA vaccines may trigger the misfolding of proteins associated with Alzheimer’s and ALS, as well as prion diseases.
His evidence? He doesn’t really say. All he includes is a three-sentence methods section summarizing an unspecified analysis of the coronavirus vaccine.
In an article debunking Classen’s paper, the American Council on Science and Health, a nonprofit science advocacy organization, wrote that Classen’s paper lacks evidence and is ""entirely speculative.""
""How was (the vaccine) analyzed? What software was used? Did he examine any controls, like cellular mRNA sequences? He doesn't say,"" the organization wrote.
RELATED: Deaths after vaccination don’t prove that COVID-19 vaccine is lethal
The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to two coronavirus vaccines: one from Pfizer-BioNTech and one from Moderna. Clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants indicated no connection between the vaccines and neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s or ALS.
Millions of Americans have received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines since they were approved. If they caused neurodegenerative or prion diseases, those instances would be documented in the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System — but they’re not.
""VAERS has received no reports of prion-related diseases, Alzheimer's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) after COVID-19 vaccination,"" said Martha Sharan, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







How do we know Trump is at Walter Reed? Here’s a rough timeline of the president’s status over the past few days.
On Oct. 2, Trump posted a video on Twitter shortly before departing the White House on Marine One. There is footage and photo evidence of him both leaving the White House and arriving at Walter Reed.
On Oct. 3, Trump’s medical team held a press conference on the president’s condition outside the hospital. Later in the day, Trump posted another video on Twitter thanking the healthcare workers at Walter Reed. The White House also released two photos that show Trump looking at documents or signing a piece of paper in the presidential suite at Walter Reed.
RELATED: Fact-checking misinformation about Trump, COVID-19
On Oct. 4, Trump’s medical team gave another update on his condition outside the hospital. Dr. Brian Garibaldi, a pulmonary physician, said the president could be discharged as soon as Monday.
A reporter for New York Magazine, Yashar Ali, debunked the claim that Trump wasn’t really at Walter Reed. Tweeting a version of the Trump video, he wrote: ""I can't believe some of you conspiracy theorists are forcing me to do this, but a former USSS (Secret Service) agent who was on President Obama's detail has confirmed to me that this is indeed the larger office inside METU (Medical Evaluation & Treatment Unit) at Walter Reed.""
There is also no evidence that Trump is faking his illness. That unfounded theory is outweighed by the significant amount of evidence showing that Trump does, in fact, have COVID-19.

Facebook posts","No, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus




A viral Facebook post suggests that a new coronavirus outbreak is related to an expired patent and that, while journalists are ""fearmongering"" over a quarantine, there is actually a vaccine available for it.
The Jan. 22 post begins:
""So.. patent on this ‘new’ Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today.. We have a sudden outbreak. There's magically already a vaccine available.. And NOW fear mongering spread by the media about quarantine.""
Included with the post are screenshots of:


Part of a patents.google.com page that seems to indicate a U.S. patent application has expired, but there is no reference to the coronavirus or to what the application is for at all.


A CNN.com headline — which seems to contradict the Facebook post — that says: ""Vaccine for new Chinese coronavirus in the works.""


A South China Morning Post headline that says: ""China grants emergency quarantine powers to stop spread of Wuhan virus.""


The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Here’s what we know.
There is an outbreak of what is known as the Wuhan coronavirus. 
There are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans. One of them, categorized as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become known as the Wuhan coronavirus because of the city of about 11 million people in central China where it was discovered. Another is known as SARS-CoV and is the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
Two weeks before this Facebook claim was posted, the New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had blamed a new coronavirus for sickening 59 people in Wuhan. The cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. 
By the day the Facebook post was published, the outbreak had killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 400 — including a Washington State man who had recently been to the Wuhan region — and had spread to several other countries, according to the Times.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Despite what the Facebook post suggests regarding a recently expired patent and a new vaccine, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus available. The partial image of a patents page that is included with the post refers to a patent associated with the coronavirus that causes SARS, a different illness.
It makes no sense that there could have been a patent for a vaccine for a coronavirus that was only just discovered.
In fact, the CNN story cited in the post quotes a top U.S. federal health official as saying the National Institutes of Health is merely ""in the process of taking the first steps"" towards developing a vaccine, and that it would be more than a year until a vaccine might be available.
""There are no vaccines available for any coronaviruses let alone the (Wuhan) one,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security, in a PolitiFact interview.
As for the post’s reference to a quarantine, the Washington Post reported that Chinese health ­authorities were seeking to impose a ""­quasi-quarantine"" in the area of the outbreak, advising people in Wuhan not to leave. But the authorities could also forcibly quarantine people known to have or suspected to have the coronavirus, according to the report.
Hours after the Facebook post, the Chinese government announced plans to quarantine Wuhan, indicating the city will cancel planes and trains leaving the city and suspend buses, subways and ferries.
Before we close, two points for putting this outbreak in perspective:
1. This coronavirus has been compared to the SARS outbreak of 2003, which caused 774 deaths in more than two dozen countries (none in the United States). 
But the rate of fatalities currently appears to be much lower; and it is still unclear the degree to which human-to-human transmission is possible with this virus, according to an article by Adalja.
2. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the Wuhan coronavirus is ""a serious public health concern,"" but the immediate health risk to the general American public ""is considered low at this time.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post states: ""So.. patent on this ‘new’ Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today.. We have a sudden outbreak. There's magically already a vaccine available.. And NOW fear mongering spread by the media about quarantine.""
There was an outbreak in recent weeks of what is known as the Wuhan coronavirus. 
News media reported that Chinese authorities have taken steps to quarantine Wuhan, the city in China where the outbreak was discovered.
More importantly, there was no expired patent related to the Wuhan coronavirus, and there is currently no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, either.

In a barrage of tweets slamming the coronavirus response, Clarke said he was tired of erring on the side of caution since this is just “the damn flu.”

Coronavirus and the flu do have similarities in spread and symptoms, but there are huge differences in the death rate and ability to treat coronavirus.

David A. Clarke, the outspoken former sheriff of Milwaukee County, says he is leaving Twitter. If that’s true, he sure went out with a bang.
Clarke put the nation’s coronavirus response on blast with a barrage of tweets on March 15, 2020, some of which were later removed by Twitter. Among them:


He urged people to ""go out into the streets"" and demand that schools reopen and government stop exerting such ""control over our lives.""


He said the coronavirus is ""an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism.""


He insisted — without any evidence — that George Soros, a prominent backer of liberal causes, is ""somewhere involved in this.""


Whew.
There’s plenty of potential Pants on Fire ratings to be had from the Stetson-wearing controversy-magnet, but we’re going to focus on a fourth, since-deleted tweet. 
Here’s the full text (minus a few choice words):
""I am tired of all this, ‘We have to err on the side of caution’ (expletive). We have to get back to reasonableness dammit. It’s the damn flu. Stop being afraid and start being sensible. Wash your (expletive) hands! Stop buying toilet paper. Do you (expletive) hear me????""
Clarke stepped down as sheriff in 2017 after 15 years as the county’s top cop, saying he was leaving to take a high-ranking post in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — a job that never materialized. In the time since, Clarke has also lost posts at a pro-President Trump super PAC and as a regular contributor on Fox News.
Now he’s using his free time to make the case everyone is being unreasonable because this is just ""the damn flu.""
Let’s break it down.
How they’re the same
Coronavirus and the flu are both viruses, and experts say they have some shared characteristics:
Risk factors — The groups of people at highest risk are similar, including the elderly.
Spread — Both diseases spread from person to person through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes (though it’s possible coronavirus lingers in the air longer after the sick person has left).

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Prevention — The expert advice is similar: wash your hands, don’t touch your face, stay away from people who are sick and stay home if you are sick.
Symptoms — Both cause fever, cough, body aches and fatigue, though coronavirus is more likely to cause shortness of breath.
Treatment —  Neither virus is treatable with antibiotics (those only work on bacterial infections).
How they’re different
The diseases have some critical differences, most importantly the death rate and lack of a vaccine.
Based on the current numbers, someone with COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus — is 23 to 68 times more likely to die than someone who contracts the flu, based on the latest data from the World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Vaccine — A flu vaccine is available and effective to prevent the flu, or at least reduce its severity. A coronavirus vaccine is not yet available, and likely won’t be for at least a year.
Treatment — There are antiviral medications that address flu symptoms and can even shorten the duration of the illness, but such medications are still being tested for coronavirus.
Death rate — The fatality rate for this year’s flu is estimated by the CDC  at between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States. The coronavirus fatality rate was estimated at 2.3% of those infected by China’s CDC and 3.4% by the World Health Organization (though many expect that to fall to the 1-2% range once we know more about how many people have been infected).
Infections — Coronavirus has, so far, infected far fewer people. There were about 3,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. when Clarke tweeted, compared to an estimated 36 million to 51 million flu illnesses this season.
Knowledge and research — Scientists know much more about the flu, such as details on how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms and treatment. Such details on coronavirus remain a point of debate.
All this to say, the CDC and other health officials have made it clear coronavirus presents a litany of risks the standard flu does not. The overwhelmed health care systems in first China, then Italy reinforced the severity of the disease and the breadth of its potential impact here.
And the reaction of government alone — closing schools, bars, restaurants and more — makes it clear there is a stark difference between the two.
Our rating
Ranting against those who would ""err on the side of caution,"" Clarke claimed coronavirus is just the ""damn flu.""
There is indeed overlap in some basic areas — what symptoms it causes, how it is spread, who is most at risk, etc. But those pale in light of the stark differences.
There is no vaccine for coronavirus. Treatment approaches are not as well established. And most critically, someone who contracts COVID-19 is at least 20 times more likely to die of the disease than someone with the flu, based on the best available data.
The overall theme from Clarke’s tweetstorm was that the coronavirus is no big deal — that the disease is just the same old flu virus with a heaping spoonful of government overreach.
That flies in the face of lots of established science, as well as what nations like China and Italy have already experienced.

Facebook posts","No, the CDC hasn’t stopped calling COVID-19 a pandemic




If Your Time is short



• The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March.
• There is no evidence the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed the term “pandemic” and replaced it with “outbreak” on its website homepage; “outbreak” has been used on the homepage for months.
• On many pages, the CDC website refers to “the COVID-19 pandemic.”



See the sources for this fact-check




On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. At the time, more than 118,000 cases of COVID-19 had been identified in over 110 countries worldwide, and the disease has continued to spread since.
Now, more than 27 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. But some social media users are still questioning the terms used to describe the disease.
""The CDC has removed the ‘Covid-19 Pandemic’ and replaced it with ‘Covid-19 Outbreak’ on their website,"" one Facebook post says. ""It was never a pandemic.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post mischaracterizes the coronavirus updates on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website homepage.
As early as Jan. 18, the CDC’s top homepage story was about the coronavirus. ""CDC is closely monitoring an outbreak caused by a novel (new) coronavirus in Wuhan City, China,"" the story said, according to an archived version of the page.
The CDC was also using the term ""outbreak"" in February and March, archived pages show.
The CDC homepage still refers to the virus as an outbreak on its homepage.
However, the use of the term ""outbreak"" doesn’t mean COVID-19 is not a pandemic, as the CDC’s website explains.
The site defines outbreak as ""a higher-­than-expected number of occurrences of disease in a specific location and time.""

""An outbreak is called an epidemic when there is a sudden increase in cases. As COVID-19 began spreading in Wuhan, China, it became an epidemic,"" the website explains. ""Because the disease then spread across several countries and affected a large number of people, it was classified as a pandemic.""
The CDC site uses the term ""outbreak"" to describe COVID-19 on its homepage, while ""pandemic"" is used elsewhere on the site.
The post also incorrectly asserts that COVID-19 was never a pandemic.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11 and has not changed that designation. 
The CDC refers to COVID-19 as a pandemic on various website pages dedicated to providing coronavirus information, including the ""Global COVID-19"" page, the ""Travel during the COVID-19 Pandemic"" page and others.
The CDC’s page about influenza pandemics, which was last updated on May 12, plainly declares: ""The United States is NOT currently experiencing an influenza pandemic. There is an ongoing pandemic with a new coronavirus.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims, ""The CDC has removed the ‘Covid-19 Pandemic’ and replaced it with ‘Covid-19 Outbreak’ on their website. It was never a pandemic.""
The CDC website’s homepage currently refers to the ""novel coronavirus outbreak,"" and has been using that term since January. But there is no evidence the CDC removed the word ""pandemic"" to replace it with ""outbreak.""

The NBA suspended its season in mid-March after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus. More recent reports suggest the league could cancel the rest of its season due to the pandemic.
But there is no evidence that NBA players voted to suspend games until Trump was removed from office. The fake news story was copied from a website that claims to be satirical.
The website, BustaTroll.org, says on its about page that it’s part of the ""‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery"" and ""everything on this website is fiction."" The network is run by a man named Christopher Blair, a Maine man who has said his goal is to trick conservatives into sharing made-up content on Facebook.
Fake news websites often copy Blair’s stories to get clicks and generate digital advertising revenue. While Blair’s sites have disclaimers warning that the content is made-up, websites that copy his content typically do not. In January, we investigated how a network of more than 100 hoax sites republished Blair’s articles to become a popular source of misinformation on Facebook, where users shared the stories as if they were true.

Donald Trump","Reporter was right: Trump did question governors’ ventilator requests




If Your Time is short



• When journalist Yamiche Alcindor asked a question of President Donald Trump, she was accurately citing a previous comment Trump had made on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show.
• During the interview with Hannity, Trump said, “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers (for ventilators) that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.”



See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump argued with ""PBS NewsHour"" reporter Yamiche Alcindor over what the president had said, or hadn’t said, about New York’s need for ventilators.
Ventilators are a type of medical equipment considered vital for saving the lives of patients hit hardest by the virus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made urgent calls for more ventilators to cope with a rising number of hospitalizations in his state due to coronavirus.
""All the predictions say you could have an apex needing 140,000 beds and about 40,000 ventilators,"" Cuomo told reporters March 27, citing estimates by Weill Cornell Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and McKinsey & Co.
Anthony Fauci, a leading infectious-disease specialist who is on the White House’s coronavirus task force, told CNN, ""There are a lot of different calculations. My experience, I tend to believe Gov. Cuomo."" 
The exchange between Trump and Alcindor came during a March 29 Rose Garden press conference. It unfolded this way:
Alcindor: ""You've said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need. You said New York might need —""
Trump: ""I didn’t say that.""
Alcindor: ""— might not need 30,000.""
Trump: ""I didn’t say that.""
Alcindor: ""You said it on Sean Hannity’s, Fox News.""
Trump: ""I didn’t say — come on. Come on.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The exchange continued, with Trump at one point telling Alcindor, ""Be nice. Don’t be threatening."" He later cut her off before she was able to ask her second question, although another reporter subsequently handed her the microphone so that she could ask it.
Here, we’ll look at the substance of the dispute between Trump and Alcindor. Which of them was right about what he said during a March 26 phone interview on Hannity’s show on Fox News? 
Alcindor was.
When we looked at Trump’s interview with Hannity, we found two portions in which Trump addressed this question.
Here’s the first:

""Gov. Cuomo and others that say we want, you know, 30,000 of them (ventilators). 30,000! All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers.""

Later, Hannity picked up on this theme. Hannity said he was ""kind of angry at Andrew Cuomo. I had a great — I had him on radio for 40 minutes, great conversation. I grew up in — I was born and raised in New York. And then it's, ‘I need 30,000 ventilators.’ And I'm like OK, it really — it was annoying me.""
Trump subsequently echoed this sentiment.

""New York is a bigger deal. But it's going to go also. But I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?""

So, contrary to Trump’s repeated denials during the press conference, this passage clearly shows that the president told Hannity that he feels the numbers of ventilators being requested by governors, including Cuomo, are higher than what’s needed.
Our ruling
Trump told Alcindor that ""I didn’t say that"" some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need.
That’s directly refuted by Trump’s comments during Hannity’s show, in which he said, ""I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.""

Trump cited an Instagram post based on provisional death counts from the CDC. The CDC says such data is “incomplete” and “will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods.”


The U.S. has reported over 229,000 coronavirus deaths to date, the most in the world. The CDC continues to find “excess deaths” above what would normally be expected.

""The reality is this: If you look, I put it up on my Instagram a couple days ago, because I went through the CDC data, because I kept hearing about new infections,"" Trump said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Experts rejected Trump’s false claim about COVID-19 deaths. It came on the same day that the U.S. reported a record number of new cases and around 1,000 deaths due to the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University, the COVID Tracking Project and other sources. 
""There is no other way to slice these data — 1,000 deaths per day is most assuredly not ‘nothing,’"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University.
She called the claim ""particularly absurd"" and ""extraordinarily cruel"" to those who have recently lost loved ones to the virus.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Recent daily death counts
The death rate has declined since the spring. Some explanations that have come up in our reporting include doctors understanding the disease better and masks becoming more common.
But Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the recent daily death tallies can ""by no measure"" be considered ""almost nothing."" 
The Trump administration’s coronavirus testing czar, Adm. Brett Giroir, said Oct. 28 that with the recent upticks in cases and hospitalizations, ""we are starting to see the increase in deaths.""

As the calendar turns to November, the U.S. has had more than 229,000 COVID-19 deaths, the most in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. That’s nearly 20% of the world’s total, in a country with about 4% of the global population.

One recent CDC study said the U.S. has seen ""excess deaths"" related to the coronavirus every week since March. The study said the U.S. has lost an estimated 299,028 more lives since Jan. 26, 2020, than would be expected.
""These are deaths that we wouldn’t normally expect,"" said Mary Jo Trepka, a professor and the chair of the epidemiology department at Florida International University.

Provisional death counts are lagging and incomplete
Trump’s Instagram post shows a chart that is labeled Oct. 26. The image says that data comes from the CDC, and it includes a link that directs to the agency’s provisional death count data.
Alexis C. Madrigal, a reporter with the Atlantic who helped launch the COVID Tracking Project, noted on Twitter that Trump appeared to have made ""a common misinterpretation"" of what the provisional death counts are able to show.
The provisional death counts lag by a few weeks, because they are based on death certificates that take time to report and process. The CDC says its provisional death counts ""may differ from other published sources."" The agency says the data is ""incomplete"" and ""will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods."" 
For those reasons, experts told PolitiFact that the provisional counts shouldn’t be used to draw conclusions about the impact of the virus in the most recent weeks. 
""There’s such a delay in terms of the classification of deaths that of course it’s going to look like there’s hardly any deaths over the last couple of weeks,"" Trepka said. 
""You can’t say anything definitive about provisional data when we know there are likely to be revisions,"" Adalja added. 
The more telling figures, Trepka said, are the excess death estimates over time.
Scientists have warned that colder weather and state reopenings could bring a staggering death toll in the winter, as the continued coronavirus threat overlaps with the flu season.
""If things do not change, if they continue on the course we’re on, there’s going to be a whole lot of pain in this country with regard to additional cases and hospitalizations and deaths,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, in an Oct. 28 interview with CNBC.
Our ruling
Trump said the number of coronavirus deaths is ""almost nothing.""
Experts rejected the claim, which came on a day when the U.S. reported roughly 1,000 new coronavirus deaths. The country leads the world with over 229,000 total COVID-19 deaths. 
With those numbers, it’s ridiculous to say deaths are down to ""almost nothing.""
Trump pointed viewers to a post on his Instagram account that appeared to show provisional death counts from the CDC. But his post left out a key CDC disclaimer, which said that such provisional counts are incomplete due to lags in reporting death certificate results. The result was a gross misrepresentation of where the trend lines are heading.

Since January, PolitiFact has fact-checked more than 100 claims about COVID-19. Some of the falsehoods, such as conspiracy theories about the virus’ spread, are quite elaborate.
A more recent Facebook post is not one of those claims.
In a March 19 post, a Facebook user said the coronavirus doesn’t actually exist.
""There is no virus,"" the user wrote in all capital letters. ""The government is trying to enforce martial law and place a chip inside of us as a ‘vaccine.’""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had more than 8,000 shares as of March 19.

The post is bogus — it’s similar to a conspiracy theory that falsely claims the media and politicians have fabricated the threat of COVID-19. There is ample evidence that the coronavirus is real and infecting hundreds of thousands of people around the world.

Scientists have traced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 to Hubei Province, China, in November. Several news outlets covered the subsequent outbreak in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.
From there, the coronavirus spread to more than 100 countries around the world. As of March 19, more than 191,000 people had been infected and 7,807 had been killed by the virus, according to the World Health Organization.
Footage from a variety of news outlets has documented the spread of COVID-19. Scientists have isolated the genetic data and approximate origin of the virus, as well as how different groups of people are affected. They’ve also released microscopic images of coronavirus virions.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). All three have their origins in bats and cause symptoms like cough, shortness of breath and fever. COVID-19 is a ""novel,"" or new, coronavirus, meaning it had not been previously identified.
The WHO has declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic and global health emergency. On the advice of health officials, several countries — including France, Italy and Spain — have ordered nationwide lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. Coronavirus prevention measures have caused the plunge of global financial markets, as well as layoffs across the country.
To claim that the virus at the center of the pandemic does not exist, as the Facebook post does, is inaccurate and ridiculous.

No version of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act grants pay raises for members of Congress.


The House and Senate are slated to receive $35 million from the stimulus. The money will go toward offsetting the costs of maintaining congressional law enforcement and child care staff, as well as improving teleworking capabilities.

The $2 trillion economic relief package that President Donald Trump signed March 27 is aimed at giving aid to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. But some widely shared posts on Facebook claim the legislation helps Congress more than workers.
While the stimulus, officially known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, will dole out $1,200 checks to every adult making less than $75,000 per year, a March 26 post says the cash is pennies compared to the pay raise that legislators are giving themselves.
""Congress wants $25 million for raises. That’s $46,700 each,"" the text post reads. ""Now who’s thinking of you.""
Another post, published March 20, asserts that the House of Representatives voted to award its members an extra $8,000 per month instead of giving aid to senior citizens. A March 25 post is even more specific, claiming the congressional pay raise is on page 134 of the stimulus.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Collectively, they’ve been shared more than 140,000 times.

The CARES Act is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. The legislation offers economic support in the form of small business loans, tax cuts, and health-related spending. In addition to sending cash to everyday Americans, the law will give aid to the airline industry, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
We’ve seen a lot of misinformation about the stimulus, so we wanted to look into these Facebook posts to see if there’s any truth to them.

While the CARES Act does allocate money to some Capitol employees, there is nothing in the legislation that gives a pay raise to members of Congress. Several fact-checkers have debunked the claim.
""The CARES Act does not provide either a pay raise or any funding for Member salaries,"" said Evan Hollander, communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, in an email. ""Likewise, no version of the legislation — House or Senate — ever included provisions for a Member pay raise or funding for salaries.""
We checked page 134 of the stimulus package as it appeared on March 25, when one of the Facebook posts was published. It contains information about grants given to states that have ""short-time compensation programs,"" which are alternatives to layoffs for employers that experience a reduction in available work. Under the programs, employees who have their hours cut are permitted to collect a percentage of unemployment benefits to make up for lost wages.
RELATED: The Senate stimulus bill: What’s in it for you
The March 25 version of the CARES Act said nothing about pay increases for Congress. Neither does the final version of the stimulus.
Hollander said there is $25 million in the stimulus to ""support the House’s capability to telework,"" including equipment purchases and improvements to the network. There is also money for reimbursing the staff of the House Child Care Center, covering the costs of food service contracts and paying the House sergeant-at-arms.
Meanwhile, the Senate is slated to get $10 million from the stimulus. $1 million will go to the sergeant-at-arms to remain available for coronavirus response while $9 million will be reserved for ""miscellaneous items,"" including reimbursement for workers at the Senate Employee Child Care Center.

Coronavirus







Ted Cruz","Mask guidance for vaccinated people is based in science




U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Twitter Tuesday to challenge the latest coronavirus guidance as vaccines were being distributed around the country.
Cruz responded specifically to Dr. Vin Gupta, a lung and intensive care unit doctor who appeared on MSNBC to caution vaccine recipients against abandoning the kinds of preventative measures public health experts have been emphasizing all year.  
""This is one of the misperceptions here: just because you get vaccinated with a second dose, it does not mean you should be participating in things like traveling in the middle of an out-of-control pandemic or that you’re liberated from masks,"" Gupta told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd. ""Everything still applies until all of us get the two-dose regimen, and we don’t think that’s going to happen until June or July."" 
Many unknowns surround the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. For instance, it’s unclear if vaccinations strictly protect infected people from serious illness, or if they also prevent people from getting infected, Gupta said.
""Don’t let your guard down just because you got vaccinated,"" he said. ""You might be able to get infected by the virus and pass it on to others.""
The comment was enough to peeve Cruz, who has previously criticized guidance to wear masks and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
""This is a bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult,"" Cruz said in a tweet responsive to Gupta’s mask-wearing advice. ""It’s not about vaccines or protecting people’s lives — it is instead profoundly anti-science, and is only focused on absolute govt control of every aspect of our lives.""
In July, Cruz faced criticism after he was photographed maskless on an American Airlines flight one month after the airline required passengers to wear face masks while onboard planes.
Cruz stirred controversy again when he called Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, ""a complete ass"" for asking a fellow senator to wear a mask while speaking. And in November, as Texas public health officials urged people to avoid large holiday gatherings as daily case numbers reached record highs, Cruz tweeted a graphic with the words ""Come and take it"" beneath a Thanksgiving turkey.
So is the latest round of COVID-19 guidance — urging continued mask-wearing and discouraging travel — ""profoundly anti-science"" as Cruz claims?
""I think [Cruz] is talking beyond his knowledge,"" said Dr. Jaquelin Dudley, professor of molecular biosciences and associate director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas.
""This whole thing about mask-wearing, taking a vaccine and social distancing has somehow become a political football instead of, let's just talk about what we know and what we don't know,"" she said.
Science-based guidance
Cruz’s office did not respond to a request for clarification on precisely what the senator meant by ""anti-science."" And a spokesperson for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the organization for which Gupta works, declined to address Cruz’s comments in an effort to remain apolitical. (""With the issue at hand — responding to comments by a U.S. senator stating that protective measures against COVID-19 constitute ""bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult"" — it would be impossible to make this apolitical,"" a spokesperson said.)

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







But the guidance highlighted by Gupta is the same messaging that has come from the very top level of the U.S. coronavirus response apparatus. On Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Donald Trump’s top adviser on the coronavirus crisis, spoke before an online audience and gave the same cautionary advice.
""It’s not going to be like turning a light switch on and off. It’s not going to be overnight. It’s going to be gradual. ... I don’t believe we’re going to be able to throw the masks away and forget about physical separation and congregant settings for a while, probably likely until we get into the late fall and early next winter, but I think we can do it,"" he said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advises that there is not enough information ""to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others,"" suggesting that more time is needed for experts to understand how the virus will respond to vaccinated persons.
According to Dr. Jonathan Temte of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, the clinical trials of the vaccine have only looked at how the vaccine prevents illness. Those trials didn’t provide any information on transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could still carry and spread the virus.
It takes repeat exposures for the immune system to learn how to best fight off a virus, which is why COVID-19 vaccinations require two doses about three weeks apart, according to the CDC. Clinical trials through the National Institutes of Health tell us that the immune system begins to create a beta version of antibodies after a person receives the first dose of the vaccine. These are the body’s least optimal version of these antibodies. Phase III trials — which test for vaccine efficacy — indicate these initial antibodies are capable of fighting off severe illness caused by the virus, but may be less capable of preventing the virus’ spread. 
A second dose of the vaccine helps the body create a new version of antibodies more honed in on fighting COVID-19. A person’s immune system is most capable of fighting off COVID-19 about one month after the initial dose of vaccine. 
""Your body learns. You can’t assume that on day one after the vaccine you’re going to be protected and you’re not going to be able to spread the infection,"" Dudley said.
""We don’t have that data yet. There’s been so many things to learn,"" she said.
This is one of the primary sources of uncertainty surrounding the vaccine: whether vaccinated people can be contagious. If vaccinations protect only against illness and not transmissions, achieving herd immunity through vaccination becomes more difficult, according to the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet.
""Pfizer and Moderna together project that there will be enough vaccines for 35 million individuals in 2020, and perhaps up to 1 billion in 2021,"" The Lancet wrote. ""As a result, many millions of people at high risk of disease will not be immunized any time soon, necessitating the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions.""
Furthermore, it’s also unknown how long immunity will last in a vaccinated person, or how effective vaccination will be in older people or those with underlying comorbidities.
Our ruling
The guidance issued by the CDC that urges vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and avoid travel was described by Cruz as ""profoundly anti-science.""
The emerging vaccines each were placed through months of clinical trials that tested for their efficacy in preventing illness. Their efficacy in preventing transmission was not part of the trials and is not yet known. The guidance issued by the public health community is borne out of science’s blind spots in regard to transmission and the gradual pace of vaccine distribution.

Facebook posts","No, masks don't collect the coronavirus




If Your Time is short



• The post inaccurately summarizes a CDC report. In reality, the report found a correlation between regular mask wearing and lower COVID-19 transmission.
• Scientific studies have consistently found that face-mask use is one of the most effective means of preventing the transmission of COVID-19. ​



See the sources for this fact-check




Health researchers have consistently found strong correlations between wearing a face mask and reducing the spread of disease like COVID-19.
But new posts on Facebook inaccurately claim that wearing a mask makes you more likely to contract COVID-19, misinterpreting a survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along the way. 
The post features a screenshot of a data table from the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. A highlighted row shows that 70.6% of these people who tested positive for the virus reported that they ""always"" wore masks or cloth face mask coverings. 
""This is really REALLY BIG,"" the post reads. ""HUGE… From the CDC… 70.6% of those testing positive wore masks ALWAYS. 3.9% of those testing positive wore masks NEVER. This means that people who wear masks, are actually ‘collecting’ the virus in their masks. The airborne particles are being absorbed into the Masks and staying on our faces rather than dissipating. A clear indication there is a correlation to more infected people wearing masks than those who do not.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman evaluated the post and the CDC report from which it’s purportedly sourced for PolitiFact. 
""There’s nothing in this (report) that indicates that mask wearing is associated with more coronavirus,"" he said. ""Honestly, I don’t even know how that could be possible.""
CDC report finds the opposite of what Facebook post claims
The CDC paper never claims that mask use increases your likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. The CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their home. 
Instead, the paper summarizes findings from a survey of 314 people. 154 of these people had tested positive for the coronavirus. The other 160 participants (the study’s control group) had tested negative for the coronavirus.
From the results of the survey, the CDC report found that two activities were linked to a positive COVID-19 test: close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as bars and restaurants.
The correlation between frequenting on-site eating locations and a positive COVID-19 test probably indicates that masks play a role in preventing the spread of the virus. The paper notes that masks ""cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking,"" so diners and bar-goers are likely exposed to infectious respiratory droplets when they lower their masks to take a drink or a bite of food. 
The table featured in the Facebook post doesn’t show that mask use is correlated with the spread of the coronavirus. In fact, it shows the opposite: more people who tested negative for the coronavirus reported that they ""always"" wore masks than people who tested positive. 
Of the 160 survey participants who tested negative, 74.2% reported that they ""always"" wore a face mask or cloth face covering. Of the 154 participants who tested positive, 70.6% reported that they ""always"" wore a mask or face covering.

Neuman took issue with the survey asking participants to self-report their rates of mask use.
""Conducting science by survey has problems,"" he said. ""There are certain things that are embarrassing or politically and socially sensitive, and you generally won’t get honest answers if you just ask them on a questionnaire because (participants) don’t know if they can trust the person on the other end, don’t know if they’ll be repercussions, or may just be embarrassed about telling the truth.""
The CDC did not respond to our request for comment by deadline.
How masks work
The Facebook post’s claim that masks are ""collecting"" infectious airborne particles mischaracterizes the science behind masks and how they stop viral spread. 
Masks are most effective as ""source control,"" preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people. Although masks do provide the wearer some protection, people can still be infected while having them on. 
Respiratory droplets with the virus are expelled into the air when infected people cough, talk, sneeze, or breathe. These droplets quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles, which are extremely difficult to remove. However, if an infected person is wearing a mask, it will catch and contain the larger droplets in the humid space between the person’s mouth and the mask. In this environment, droplets take nearly a hundred times as long to transform into airborne particles. 
Neuman shared three studies of hundreds of thousands of infected people that all found that mask-wearing reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. Unlike the CDC report, these studies didn’t rely on survey data and self-reported rates of mask use. 
The first paper, which analyzed trends in infections in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, found that face mask mandates were ""the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission."" The researchers found that a mask mandate reduced infections by over 75,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. 
The second paper, which reviewed 172 studies conducted on a total of 25,697 patients with COVID-19, SARS, or MERS across 16 countries and six continents, found that face masks ""were associated with a much lower risk of infection.""
The third paper, which analyzed 15 U.S. states found that daily infection rates decreased significantly after mask mandates were introduced. In seven of the 15 states, researchers from UC San Diego and Texas A&M found that the number of new infections per day increased steadily only to fall after face-mask requirements were implemented. In the six states the researchers analyzed that never implemented mask mandates, infections continued to increase on the same upward line. They estimated that mask mandates had prevented a total of 252,000 infections on May 18, equivalent to nearly 17% of infections in the nation at that point in time. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post says that a CDC report found that ""people who wear masks, are actually ‘collecting’ the virus in their masks.""
The CDC report cited in the post actually found the opposite: More people who tested negative for COVID-19 reported wearing masks than people who tested positive. 
Other scientific studies have consistently found that mask wearing decreases the spread of coronavirus.

This Instagram post is the latest example of that misinformation — the coronavirus vaccine is not part of a plan to track people using microchips. The video shows Biden criticizing the idea of tracking people with microchips, not supporting it.
Back in April, we saw a false claim that Democrats are pushing for everyone to get implanted with microchips via mandatory vaccinations. The notion appeared to stem from an incorrect interpretation of something Microsoft founder Bill Gates said in March about a system for at-home COVID-19 testing.
This video clip of Biden questioning Roberts in 2005 doesn’t add any new or relevant information to the false premise. The video was taken out of the larger context of a hearing during which Biden argued that a liberal interpretation of the Constitution was needed to protect the rights of Americans — particularly their right to privacy.
Here’s what he said to Roberts, in context:
""Judge, I do not believe in a Constitution where individuals could for very long have accomplished what we did had we read it in such a narrow way. Like the Founders, I believe our Constitution is as big and as grand and as great as its people. Our constitutional journey did not stop with women being barred from being lawyers, with 10-year-olds working in coal mines, or Black kids forced into different schools than white kids. Just because in the Constitution nowhere does it mention sex discrimination, child labor, segregation — it doesn't mention it. Our constitutional journey did not stop then, and it must not stop now, judge. And we’ll be faced with equally consequential decisions in the 21st century.

Tom Hanks didn’t die. 

 
The screenshot of a story about his supposed death that’s being shared on social media comes from a self-described satire website.

 



See the sources for this fact-check




About one year ago, on March 11, 2020, actor Tom Hanks announced that he and his wife, the actress Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, where he was shooting a movie. 
Social media posts at the time made Pants on Fire claims that the diagnosis was a cover for criminal charges.
Now, a new post that’s being widely shared on Instagram alleges that Hanks died in Australia a couple days after announcing he had COVID-19.
What looks like a news headline from March 13, 2020, says ""coronavirus claims life of Tom Hanks."" It attributes the information to a ""Queensland Health spokeswoman.""

And there’s plenty of evidence refuting the claim that Hanks died back in March 2020.
A couple of weeks after his COVID-19 announcement, American news outlets were reporting that Hanks and Wilson were both back stateside and had been photographed driving around Los Angeles, where they live.  
The Daily Mail published the photos of Hanks that appear in the Facebook post in May 2020. Captions on the images say Hanks is in Los Angeles, not Australia. 
On April 11, Hanks, hosted a special remote episode of ""Saturday Night Live.""
And in January, Hanks, now 64, hosted an evening celebration of President Joe Biden’s inauguration.

Facebook posts","Biden not to blame for rising diesel (or gas) prices




If Your Time is short




Gas and diesel prices have steadily risen in recent months, but it's not related to any presidential policies.
Prices dropped as demand dropped amid the pandemic shutdown. But with the COVID-19 picture improving and people moving around more, increased demand is pushing prices up as well.
Oil producers will need time to ramp up production to pre-pandemic levels after throttling output throughout 2020.




See the sources for this fact-check




A new party in the White House means it’s time for a time-honored American tradition — the blame game.
Anything wrong in the world is now the fault of the two-month old administration. Or the fault of the prior administration, depending on your political persuasion.
With gas prices on the move, this exercise is in full effect on social media. That includes a widely-shared March 10, 2021 Facebook post.
""When Sleepy Joe Came In Diesel Was $1.69,"" it reads. ""Today Diesel Is $3.19. Thanks To All That Voted For This Clown.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).
This poster gets it wrong on both the specifics and the blame. Here’s why.
Wrong numbers
Diesel prices are indeed up. The March 15 national average of $3.07 was the highest since June 2019.
But the numbers in the post are way off the mark.
The national average price for diesel was $2.64 per gallon on Jan. 20 when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took the oath of office, according to GasBuddy.com price trackers. That’s almost a dollar higher than the post claims. Meanwhile, the March 10 national average was $3.04, less than the post claimed.
So, there was an increase, but a far smaller one.
Weekly price data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows similar movement, from $2.70 to $3.14 based on the weeks closest to those points in time.
In Wisconsin, meanwhile, diesel rose from $2.50 to $2.90 between January 20 and March 10, according to GasBuddy.
The poster did not respond to a message from PolitiFact Wisconsin seeking evidence of his claim. He lives in Iowa, according to his profile, but using local numbers doesn’t help his case much. GasBuddy shows prices in Des Moines rose over that span from $2.45 to $3.00 per gallon, a slightly larger jump, but still far from the post’s claim.
Biden not to blame for spikes
The post — like many others pointing a finger at Biden over prices at the pump — is also wrong on the fundamental blame element. The price movement we’re seeing now on both diesel and gas isn’t related to Biden’s policy changes, experts say.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







For starters, the trend predates Biden. Diesel prices have steadily risen since the start of November, when Republican President Donald Trump was in office.


And Biden’s policies aren’t having any immediate impact. Biden shut down the planned Keystone XL pipeline expansion, which was to run from Canada to Nebraska. Experts consulted by PolitiFact said that decision could make oil transportation less efficient longterm, but even then they doubted it would directly affect US costs. Reuters reports existing pipelines and ongoing expansions are expected to be sufficient for the flow between the U.S. and Canada, which provides about half of America’s imported oil.
The president also imposed a 60-day ban on new fracking permits, but that doesn’t affect existing operations. Oil producers weren’t likely to be pursuing new locations now anyhow since they’re scrambling to bring back online production that was scaled back in 2020, experts say.
In reality, diesel and gas prices — like many things in 2021 — are all about the pandemic.
The reduction of economic activity, and people traveling and moving around less, reduced demand for diesel and gas both in 2020, causing a related drop in oil production amid steep financial losses in the oil industry. The Energy Information Administration, an independent government agency that provides analysis for policymakers and the public, said demand for diesel fell 8% in 2020, while demand for gas dropped by 13%.
Demand is now rising quickly as the COVID-19 picture improves and the economy rebounds, but it takes time to get the supply back to normal. The Energy Information Administration says crude oil production in the U.S. was down in 2020 and will drop again in 2021 ""as a result of a decline in drilling activity related to low oil prices."" It projects an increase in 2022.
""We’re headed for higher (price) territory until the market sees more crude oil, whether that’s supplied from the U.S. or Canadian interests or OPEC,"" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy.com. ""We are in a pretty significant imbalance. Demand has screamed higher, and production has been moving at a turtle’s pace, and part of that is because the depths of the crisis were so severe for oil companies.""
Energy and security analyst Patricia Schouker described the same dynamic to AFP, a France-based global news agency, saying recovering demand and limited production has ""pushed crude prices to their highest levels since near the start of the coronavirus pandemic.""
Outside of market-altering events like the pandemic, prices of both fuels are driven primarily by the cost of crude oil, which is in turn driven by an array of world economic conditions that influence supply and demand.
As Schouker noted, presidents have ""‘very little direct influence"" over gas and diesel prices. 
De Haan said the irony of blaming Biden is that the increasing demand is related to the growing economy. So the people prone to wrongly blame Biden for gas prices would also be slow to credit him for the economy, even though those are two sides of the same coin.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims Diesel prices have risen from $1.69 to $3.19 since Biden took office, blaming him for that jump.
The numbers aren’t close to right — the actual increase was more like 40 cents, not $1.50.
The blame element is equally off base. Diesel (and gas) prices are rising due to swelling demand as movement and economic activity increase amid the coronavirus recovery. Expert say it could take until 2022 for oil production to return to pre-pandemic levels, causing a shortage in the meantime that will drive prices up.

If Your Time is short





Administering approved vaccines is not a medical experiment. Regulators in the U.S. and the U.K. have approved several vaccines for emergency use.


In the U.S., clinical trial participants give written content. The U.K. requires consent before doctors administer vaccines, too.





See the sources for this fact-check




The video starts with a video from a child TikToker and an advertisement for silver coins. Then, it transitions to a shot of an old man in a maroon wingback chair reading from a stack of papers.
That man is Dr. Vernon Coleman, a British author who has denied the existence of HIV/AIDS and authored a book titled ""Anyone Who Tells You Vaccines Are Safe and Effective is Lying."" In the video, Coleman spins a conspiracy theory that paints the coronavirus vaccine as a dangerous medical experiment.
""I’d rather die than have that stuff in my body,"" he says.
Over the course of nearly 18 minutes, Coleman takes aim at politicians in the United Kingdom who have promoted the coronavirus vaccine. He calls the vaccine ""experimental"" and ""gene therapy"" — and says that doctors who administer it are guilty of war crimes.
""How many doctors and nurses jabbing people with this stuff are telling patients it’s a trial? How many are giving people the information they need to make a value judgment?"" Coleman says. ""I would guess somewhere close to none. And so legally, all those people giving vaccinations are war criminals.""

The video was published in an article on the website of Charlie Ward, a Briton who has promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory on his YouTube channel. The headline: ""Doctors and Nurses giving the Covid-19 Vaccine Will Be Tried as War Criminals.""
That article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Coleman’s video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool — in spite of the platform’s recent ban on vaccine misinformation. So we wanted to take a closer look at his claims, which have been promoted by anti-vaccine activists in the U.S.
Coleman is wrong. Administering approved vaccines is not a medical experiment, and doctors and nurses who administer them aren’t guilty of war crimes. Other fact-checkers have debunked similar claims.
In the video, Coleman cites two pieces of evidence: a page from the National Library of Medicine and the Nuremberg Code.
""The United States National Library of Medicine published details of the vaccine program currently underway and they say that the trial will last two years,"" Coleman said. ""Anyone having the vaccine is therefore taking part in an experiment.""

The ""vaccine program"" Coleman referred to is an ongoing clinical trial for the Pfizer and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which is expected to end Jan. 31, 2023. However, that doesn’t mean the Pfizer vaccine is an ""experiment."" 
It’s normal for safety monitoring to continue after the FDA greenlights a vaccine. Pfizer said in December that it would continue monitoring trial participants for adverse events for two years after they receive the second dose of the vaccine. The U.S. and U.K. governments also have systems in place for tracking vaccine safety.
Regulators in the U.K., where Coleman lives, approved the vaccine for emergency use Dec. 2, 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its emergency use authorization on Dec. 11. Americans started getting shots three days later. 
The FDA authorized Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use after months of stage three clinical trials, during which more than 40,000 participants received the vaccine. The FDA wrote in its assessment of the trial that the vaccine was safe and effective.
""FDA has determined that the totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19 and support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals,"" the agency wrote.
RELATED: What we know about the COVID-19 variants and how they impact vaccine efficacy
The second source that Coleman cited in the video is the Nuremberg Code, a set of research ethics that resulted from the Nuremberg Trials after World War II.
""Nuremberg Code stated explicit voluntary consent from human patients is required for experimentation,"" he said. ""People must be warned they're taking part in a trial.""
The Code does say ""the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" And since it was adopted by the Geneva Conventions of 1949, breaking that principle would constitute a war crime.
However, none of that is relevant to the coronavirus vaccine rollout.
The Nuremberg Code was created in response to experiments that Nazis conducted on prisoners in concentration camps. It says nothing about using tested and approved vaccines on patients.
In the U.S., all 43,448 participants in the Pfizer vaccine trial provided ""written informed consent,"" according to the FDA. The U.K. requires consent before health care providers administer vaccines.

In an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, Trump misconstrued data on coronavirus deaths. As of Sept. 3, 185,092 Americans had died due to COVID-19.


A CDC report found that 6% of people who died from COVID-19 only had the virus. The majority had other conditions as well, but that doesn’t mean COVID-19 wasn’t to blame.


The National Center for Health Statistics told us that COVID-19 was responsible for nearly all of the deaths involving the virus.





See the sources for this fact-check




In the past week, President Donald Trump has repeatedly spread a false claim that COVID-19 is not as deadly as his own public health agencies have reported.
He retweeted a now-deleted post that alleged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""quietly updated"" the number of coronavirus deaths. He shared another tweet from a senior legal adviser for his reelection campaign that linked to an article whose headline said ""only 9,210 Americans died from COVID-19 alone.""
And, in a Sept. 1 interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, Trump said it himself:
""I saw a statistic come out the other day, talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interesting — that they died from other reasons.""
""Well, they had comorbidities, which you’ve gotten criticized for,"" Ingraham responded.

She’s right — the president misconstrued data on coronavirus deaths. As of Sept. 3, CDC data show 185,092 Americans had died due to COVID-19, and some estimates put the death toll higher.

Trump’s claim traces back to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the CDC. Each Wednesday, the agency releases new provisional death counts for the coronavirus. The data is based on death certificates. 
In that report, the NCHS notes in a section titled ""Comorbidities"" that, ""for 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.""
""For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death,"" the report says.
Those lines have inspired a rash of claims on social media, including those retweeted by the president, that say the CDC ""adjusted"" its coronavirus death counts and the disease is not as deadly as previously thought.
Those assertions are false — we rated a related Facebook post Pants on Fire. Several other fact-checkers have also debunked them.
Let’s recap why they’re wrong.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







Comorbidities are conditions that patients experience in tandem with a primary condition. Think of conditions like cancer or diabetes, which the CDC has said put people more at risk of death if they contract the coronavirus.
The NCHS report shows that the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients with comorbidities. But that doesn’t mean COVID-19 was a non-factor.
""The point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of them had nothing else but just COVID-19,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a Sept. 1 interview with ""Good Morning America."" ""That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn’t die of COVID-19 — they did.""
""The numbers that you’ve been hearing, the 180,000-plus deaths, are real deaths from COVID-19. Let there not be any confusion about that.""
So why do 94% of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also list other conditions? 
When a coronavirus patient is admitted to the hospital, the virus is listed on their medical record. Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, perhaps they develop respiratory failure, which would also be listed on their record. Unfortunately, they die after going into cardiac arrest, so doctors take note of that, too.
RELATED: No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths
All three of those conditions would be listed on the patient’s death certificate, but COVID-19 started the process.
""The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS, told us in an email that 92% of the death certificates that mention the coronavirus state that COVID-19 was the ""underlying cause of death.""
""The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,"" Lancashire said. 
We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.

Viral image","No, vaccinated people don’t make up 60% of new COVID-19 cases




If Your Time is short




The CDC reports that out of 87 million fully vaccinated people, 7,157 people had breakthrough cases of COVID-19. That’s 0.008% of all fully vaccinated people.

 
A study of healthcare workers and frontline personnel who received the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines showed that the vaccines were 80% effective after the first dose, and 90% after the second.




See the sources for this fact-check




The worldwide push to get people vaccinated against COVID-19 is based on scientific evidence that shows that vaccines help reduce the spread of the virus and minimize the severity of infections in those who have been inoculated.
But a widely shared social media claim suggests otherwise. 
""Yale public health professor suggests 60% of new COVID-19 patients have received vaccine,"" reads a screenshot of a headline shared on Instagram. The article pictured goes on to quote Yale professor Dr. Harvey Risch: ""Clinicians have been telling me that more than half of the new COVID cases that they’re treating are people who have been vaccinated.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It  was shared April 22 on Instagram by Leila Centner, co-founder of the 300-student Centner Academy, a private Miami school that made news a few days later for barring vaccinated teachers from having contact with students, citing debunked claims about unvaccinated people suffering adverse effects after being around those who are not.
The claim is wrong.
Risch made the comments in the post during an April 19, 2021, interview on ""Steve Bannon’s War Room"" video and podcast livestream. Here’s what he said in full:
""What clinicians are telling me is more than half of the new COVID cases that they’re seeing to treat is people who’ve been vaccinated,"" Dr. Risch said. ""They’ve estimated 60% of new patients they’ve been treating have been people who’ve been vaccinated.""
Risch said that the American public is being ""sold on'' the COVID-19 vaccine, and that vaccine companies have ""provided no information"" on what the vaccines do to prevent the spread of infection.
Risch’s claim, which appears to be anecdotal, does not line up with what data shows about COVID-19 cases among those who have been vaccinated.
The CDC reported that as of April 20, 2021, more than 87 million people in the country have been fully vaccinated. Out of that number, 7,157 breakthrough cases, or cases in which a person gets sick with a disease after vaccination, were reported.

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







When those numbers are tallied up, the total number of breakthrough cases comes to only 0.008% of all fully vaccinated people. The week that Risch made his comment, April 12-19, there were 525,000 total new cases in the U.S, according to the CDC.  Even if all those 7,157 breakthrough cases came in that week (which is highly unlikely since vaccinations began in December) the percentage of new cases that came from people who had the vaccine would have been only about 1.4%. 
Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, cited additional data from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published by the CDC on April 2, 2021, which studied 3,950 vaccinated healthcare workers and frontline personnel who received the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.
The study showed that the vaccine was 80% effective after the first dose, and 90% after the second. 
""It’s just more evidence that if you’re vaccinated, you’re much, much less likely to be infected, which is what the approval studies also show.""
Offit said that for the most part, all of the COVID-19 breakthrough cases have been mild or asymptomatic, and that the vaccine technology has worked extremely well in both pre-approval studies and now in the public. 
""It was used to stop a virus which has had a number of clinical and pathological surprises,"" Offit said. ""It didn’t appear to have any serious side-effect in pre-approval studies with tens of thousands of people, and now we know it doesn’t seem to have any serious side-effect when it’s been in more than a hundred million people, you know, two hundred million doses are out there. It is remarkable.""
Our ruling
An Instagram post credits a Yale professor as saying that out of the new COVID-19 cases, 60% are patients who have had the vaccine.
The CDC reported that as of April 20, only 7,157 breakthrough cases have been reported out of 87 million fully vaccinated people. That’s 0.008% of the vaccinated population. 
Studies show that the mRNA vaccines are 80% effective after one dose, and 90% effective after two doses.

Reddit users commented that the news organization pictured in the photo is Antena 1, a TV network in Romania. The logo on the mic in the photo is consistent with that of Observator, a show on Antena 1.
A video news report that Observator uploaded to YouTube on Feb. 26 addresses mounting concerns over the spread of the coronavirus in Romania. The four4-minute piece shows people emptying shelves at grocery stores across the country, where there are four confirmed cases of the virus.
""Fear of coronavirus is emptying major stores,"" reads the caption. ""Bags of flour and corn, dozens of cans and hundreds of liters of water carried from the shelves.""
The trend of stockpiling groceries is well-documented and began in Wuhan, China, after the 2019 coronavirus first emerged there in December. As the virus spread, grocery stores across Europe and the United States were similarly affected, as customers rushed to stock up on essentials in the event of long home quarantines.
RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself.
There is no evidence that Observator or any other media organization has staged footage of empty grocery store shelves to cause coronavirus panic. That conspiracy theory has been echoed on fringe internet platforms like 4chan, where several high-profile conspiracies were created. And the Antena 1 journalist who was implicated in the original hoax has published additional footage to contextualize the image.
The global outbreak of the virus officially known as COVID-19 has infected more than 93,000 people in 76 countries — including 99 confirmed cases in the United States.

The post misattributed a quote from a 1935 Illinois Supreme Court decision about Chicago judicial salaries


The original quote refers to the Illinois Constitution and the laws that created the Municipal Court of Chicago, not the U.S. constitution


The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that the rights of a citizen can be restricted by the state for the “common good” during a health crisis





See the sources for this fact-check




From Maryland to California, governors dealing with the COVID-19 crisis have faced challenges to the legality of their stay-at-home orders, some of which are showing up in court.
A Facebook post claims that under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, these orders are already deemed unconstitutional and that many governors must forfeit their authority because they have infringed on the rights of U.S. citizens.
The post includes a picture with this text:
""This should settle the matter. This was the ruling of The United States Supreme Court shortly after the ‘civil war’ in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866) which yet stands to this day: ‘Neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution in case of emergency …’
… therefore, ANYONE who declares the suspension of constitutionally guaranteed rights (to freely travel, peacefully assemble, earn a living, freely worship, etc.) and or attempts to enforce such suspension within 50 independent, sovereign, continental United States of America is making war against our constitution(s) and, therefore, we the people. They violate their constitutional oath and, thus, immediately forfeit their office and authority and their proclamations may be disregarded with impunity and that means ANYONE; even the governor and President.""
The cited case, Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866), was about disputed judicial authority during the Civil War. In 1864, Lambdin P. Milligan was arrested and tried by a military tribunal in his home state of Indiana and sentenced to death by hanging. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the military courts established by the president during wartime had no judicial power in secure areas with established civil courts, and Milligan was released. 
The case citation and time frame in the post are legitimate. But the quote about government authority does not come from this case. 
That quote, or a close match, comes from a case argued in the Illinois Supreme Court in 1935. In People ex rel. Lyle vs. City of Chicago, the justices of Chicago’s municipal court filed a complaint against the City Council over unpaid salaries amid the Depression. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in their favor and ordered the city to pay them the partial salaries that had been withheld.
In his opinion, the Illinois chief justice said that ""neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution even in case of a great emergency."" He was referring to the Illinois Constitution and the Municipal Court of Chicago’s founding laws.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







The second part of this claim that says orders ""can be disregarded with impunity"" doesn’t come from either of these cases and wasn’t found in any court cases or acts. 
We also found ample evidence that states do have the authority to issue stay-at-home orders. According to the American Bar Association, the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment and past U.S. Supreme Court decisions dictate that ""state governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions."" 
That doesn’t mean that there haven’t been cases brought against governors and local governments in California, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania that are attempting to prove stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional. There have been mixed results from local courts, which all base their decisions on state laws and constitutions. 
Right now, the Supreme Court refuses to take a side. On May 8, the high court declined to review a case from a group of Pennsylvania businesses’ that wanted to block Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home order.
In the past, the Supreme Court has supported state’s rights to deal with public health emergencies. The best example of the Supreme Court supporting a state’s power to impose mandatory restrictions during a pandemic is Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905). 
The case was brought against the Cambridge board of health and its response to a surge in smallpox cases in the city. The city’s board of health issued an order that all adults had to be vaccinated against the disease, or they would face a $5 fine (about $100 today). Henning Jacobson refused to be vaccinated, after having bad reactions to earlier vaccines. When the state of Massachusetts fined him, he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The court ruled in the state’s favor, stating that they had full power to restrict the freedoms of any citizen if it ""is necessarily subject for the common good"" and that they had ""distinctly recognized the authority of a State to enact quarantine laws and ‘health laws of every description.’""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims that under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, stay-at-home orders are illegal and can be disregarded with impunity.

Bloggers","COVID-19 tests are not ‘scientifically meaningless’




If Your Time is short





Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are among the most common and reliable ways to test for the coronavirus.


These tests look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers use them to confirm whether someone has the disease.





See the sources for this fact-check




The United States has ramped up its COVID-19 testing capacity this summer in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Some bloggers and Facebook users say that’s a mistake.
In a June 27 article, a website called OffGuardian wrote that the tests many health care providers use to diagnose COVID-19 are ""scientifically meaningless.""
""These PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2,"" reads the article, which has been shared more than thousands of times on Facebook.
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has also been copy-pasted into text posts, which have also been shared thousands of times.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
OffGuardian was launched in 2015. The site’s name comes from the fact that its founders were all ""banned from the Guardian’s ‘Comment is Free’ sections,"" according to its about section.
OffGuardian has a track record of publishing conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda, so we wanted to take a closer look at its claim about COVID-19 testing.
The article is inaccurate — polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are among the most common and reliable ways to test for the coronavirus. Similar claims have circulated, and have been fact-checked, since March.
There are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests, also known as PCR tests, look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease.
In a fact sheet for its PCR test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the test is ""designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens, for example nasal or oral swabs.""

""If you have a positive test result, it is very likely that you have COVID-19,"" the document says.
That’s because PCR tests amplify small segments of DNA, making it easier for labs to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Health care providers have also used them for detecting viruses like HIV. It usually takes several days to get results. 
In its 4,500-word article, OffGuardian lays out several (inaccurate) theories about PCR tests. None of them prove that the tests are ""scientifically meaningless.""
OffGuardian wrote in its article that the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, ""regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection."" In a fact-check, Reuters rated that claim false — the source is a 1996 article about HIV/AIDS. It does not say PCR tests are ineffective for detecting viruses.
OffGuardian makes several other inaccurate claims in its article, including:


""There are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19."" The CDC says otherwise.


""The existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact."" Several researchers have analyzed the genetic material of the coronavirus — including its RNA.


Between 22% and 77% ""of the ‘positive’ tests are false ‘positives.’"" Currently, about 92% of tests in the United States produce negative results.


RELATED: Coronavirus testing: What we know, all in one place
There are legitimate questions about the accuracy of diagnostic COVID-19 tests, particularly for people who are not experiencing symptoms. There have been several cases of tests producing the wrong results, and some experts are concerned about false-negatives.

The Gates Foundation is trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine.


Gates spoke theoretically about how many people might suffer side effects from a vaccine, not about how many might die from it.

The conspiracy section of a conservative website carried an article with this headline:

The article from CloverChronicle.com, shared widely on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
In the interview, Gates spoke theoretically about how many people might experience side effects from a yet-to-be-developed coronavirus vaccine. 
He did not say anything about people dying from such a vaccine.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential novel coronavirus vaccines. There is no evidence that the foundation stands to profit from these efforts. 
Readers of the article were instructed to go to minute 2:35 of a video that’s embedded in the article.

Gates mentions needing about 7 billion doses worldwide and says:
""The efficacy in vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people; most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.
""Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more — 700,000 people who will suffer from that. 
""So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges — pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities — it’s very, very hard. And that actual decision of, OK, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world — governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.""
Gates makes no mention of anyone dying from the vaccine.
He’s referring to side effects and suggests, theoretically, that if 7 billion vaccines are administered and one in 10,000 people experience side effects, that would mean 700,000 people experiencing side effects.

It wasn’t the first time Trump made a false claim about Lamb. In March 2018, Trump falsely told attendees at a private fundraiser for Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley that Lamb “ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me.”

President Donald Trump tweeted a Memorial Day attack on a Democratic congressman from western Pennsylvania, labeling him an ""American fraud"" while calling his political opponent an ""American hero."" 
Trump also accused U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb — a Marine Corps veteran and former prosecutor who represents Allegheny, Butler, and Beaver counties — of being a puppet for Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and breaking his promise to vote against her for Speaker of the House.
""He said he would NOT vote for her for speaker, and he did,"" Trump wrote in a tweet endorsing Sean Parnell, an Army veteran who served in combat in Afghanistan and is Lamb’s Republican rival in Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district. 
A quick search of Lamb’s voting record shows that Trump’s claim is not true. 
Lamb vowed to support new leadership, and he followed through. He was one of 15 Democrats in Congress who did not vote for Pelosi in the January 2019 speaker election. Lamb voted for U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts instead.
He was first elected to Congress in a March 2018 special election that heralded the midterm Democratic wave to come. Lamb won his first full term in November 2018, defeating three-term Republican incumbent Keith Rothfus by 12 percentage points. 
Lamb was a federal prosecutor who served as a Judge Advocate in the Marine Corps for four years before being honorably discharged as a captain in 2013. He later served in the Marine reserves, ending his service this year.

""These people have been lying about my record since the day I became a candidate,"" he wrote. 
""It hasn’t stopped, and it won’t stop, until we beat them at the ballot box in November."" 
Trump’s original tweet also misspelled Lamb’s name. He later deleted it and replaced it with a tweet that spells Lamb’s name correctly but makes the same false claim.

If Your Time is short





Between the end of January and mid March, Trump told the public that the virus was well under control and presented little risk.


He told Bob Woodward that he played down the virus to avoid creating panic.





See the sources for this fact-check




Confronted with a recording of President Donald Trump from mid March saying that he minimized the coronavirus in public, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the opposite was true.
""The president never downplayed the virus,"" she said in a White House press briefing Sept. 9.
McEnany was responding to the release of recorded interviews from investigative reporter Bob Woodward’s new book about Trump entitled ""Rage."" The audio posted by the Washington Post shows Trump explaining to Woodward why his message about the virus shifted between January and March.
""To be honest with you, I wanted to always play it down,"" Trump said March 19. ""I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.""
McEnany said Trump never lied to the American people. 
""He was expressing calm, and he was taking early action, and his actions are reflective of how seriously he took it,"" she said.
We tracked Trump’s responses as the pandemic unfolded. Between January and mid March, Trump consistently minimized the threat posed by the virus. He would talk about the handful of cases in the country and compare them with the more than 25,000 deaths caused by seasonal flu. He said the country had gotten ""lucky.""
Here are some key moments in the early months of the pandemic that show him downplaying the threat.
On Jan. 24, Trump tweeted his thanks to China for working to contain the virus.
""It will all work out well,"" he wrote. 
China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020 
On Jan. 30, Trump announced restrictions on travel from China. That night, he told supporters at a campaign rally in Iowa, ""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. ... We think it’s going to have a very good ending for it.""
On Feb. 2, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity, ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" 
On Feb. 14, in a meeting with members of the Border Patrol Council, he remained reassuring.

""We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape.""
On Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for $1.25 billion in emergency aid. The same day he tweeted that the virus ""is very much under control"" and the stock market was ""starting to look very good to me!"" 
The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2020 
As late as March 9, Trump tweeted out blame to the media and the Democrats for trying to ""inflame"" the situation ""far beyond what the facts would warrant."" He cited the U.S. surgeon general as saying, ""The risk is low to the average American.""
The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.”— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020 
Over the next few days, the situation changed rapidly. The World Health Organization officially designated the virus as a pandemic. Trump banned most non-Americans arriving from Europe. He declared a state of emergency. 
On March 17, Trump said in a news conference that for the next 14 days, ""we’re asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people.""
At the news conference, Trump said there was no shift in tone from the White House: ""I've always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""
We rated that claim Pants on Fire because whatever he may have known at the time, his words up to that point did not reflect the threat of a pandemic.
Two days after that, he spoke to Woodward about why he downplayed the virus earlier and why he wanted to continue to downplay it.
Our ruling
McEnany said Trump never downplayed the virus. 
The record shows she’s wrong. During the early months of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump said the country was in very good shape and blamed Democrats and the media for trying to inflame the situation beyond what the facts would warrant. 
In the very tape that McEnany was asked about, Trump said he downplayed the virus to avoid creating panic. McEnany spun that as him showing leadership to calm a worried nation.
The reasons Trump said what he said aren’t part of this fact-check. Trump’s words are. And they give zero support to McEnany’s statement.

I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2020 
Trump and his administration acted to keep the virus out of the United States, but his words in public downplayed the threat for many weeks.
Moves in Washington and worldwide
On Jan. 20, about three weeks after China first reported the new virus, the World Health Organization reported cases in China, Japan, Thailand and South Korea. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention activated its emergency response center on Jan. 21. On Jan. 29, the White House formed the Coronavirus Task Force, headed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and coordinated by the National Security Council.
On Jan. 30, Trump effectively banned all non-Americans from entering the country if they had been in China in the previous two weeks. Americans could come back, but they would be quarantined. Azar declared a public health emergency.
The same day, WHO declared a global health emergency. It was the fifth time WHO issued such a warning since 2005.
Trump aims to reassure
Fears of a pandemic were in the air by mid January. The federal response came as Trump painted a more comforting picture.
On Jan. 22, in an interview with CNBC, Trump was asked, ""Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?""

""No,"" Trump replied. ""Not at all. We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.""
Two days later, he gave the sense that the virus would be kept in China.

Trump maintained that upbeat tone at a Jan. 30 rally in Iowa. 
""We think we have it very well under control,"" he said. ""We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully.""
In a Feb. 2 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump repeated the idea that transmission was unlikely.
""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,"" he said. ""We’re going to see what happens, but we did shut it down.""
Trump also suggested that warmer weather in April would beat back the virus. As late as Feb. 24 and Feb. 25, Trump continued to paint a picture of a virus corralled.
He tweeted that the virus was ""very much under control in the USA,"" and added ""Stock Market starting to look very good to me!""
In India, he said ""we have very few people with it,"" and they were getting better.
This was at a time when WHO had reported 76,000 cases worldwide.
A pandemic is when a new disease spreads worldwide. On March 11, WHO formally declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic.

Trump said that he’s ""always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."" 
Until late February, Trump spoke as though the U.S. problem was limited and well under control. That description is at odds with the nature of a pandemic.

• The study actually found the opposite. Mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.

A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that widespread mask use significantly helped stem the spread of the coronavirus. 
Yet a conservative news site claims that the study actually found the opposite, quoting two sentences out of context to make it appear that mask mandates had an insignificant effect on coronavirus case rates. 
""CDC: Mask Mandates Made No Statistical Difference,"" reads the headline of an article published in Texas Scorecard that is being shared widely on Facebook.
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We interviewed three public health experts familiar with the study and a spokesperson from the CDC. They were unanimous: The article’s reading of the study is off-base. 
""It’s not accurate at all to say that mask mandates played no role in decreasing COVID-19 case rates and deaths,"" said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions. ""People are completely misunderstanding the study design if they are coming to that conclusion.""
Both the study and the article were released as state governments considered lifting mask requirements, with five states — Texas, North Dakota, Mississippi, Iowa and Montana — opting to do so. 
We reached out to the author of the article but did not hear back. 
Article quotes study out of context
The main takeaway from the study was that ""mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates,"" said CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald. 
This conclusion is stated multiple times in the agency’s study.

As evidence for its claims, the Texas Scorecard article quotes two sentences from the study out of context. 
""Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,"" reads the first. 
The article takes the term ""reference period"" to refer to the period after the mask mandate was implemented. However, the report explicitly defines the ""reference period"" as the 20 days before the mask mandates started. 
""When the authors (of the CDC study) say ‘daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,’ they mean that rates 60-21 days before mandates were not statistically different from those 20-1 days before the mandate,"" explained Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Nikolas Wada. 
The CDC study compared case rates from these two time periods to make sure that there wasn’t already a downward trend in coronavirus case and death rates before the mask mandate was implemented. According to McDonald, this helped the CDC to rule out other factors that could have accounted for the decrease. 
The Texas Scorecard article also quotes the following sentence from the CDC study out of context: ""Changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates were not statistically significant 1-20 and 21-40 days after restrictions were lifted."" 
The sentence appears at a point in the study that discusses the effect of indoor dining on coronavirus case and death rates. Although the study found that allowing restaurants to serve customers initially had a statistically insignificant effect on coronavirus case rates, the effect did gradually become statistically significant sometime between the 41st and 60th day after dining restrictions were lifted.
Other studies on mask mandates from the CDC and other sources have consistently found that widespread mask use decreases coronavirus case rates. 
Our ruling
Texas Scorecard wrote that a CDC study found that ""Mask Mandates Made No Statistical Difference"" on coronavirus case rates. 
That’s wrong and amounts to a ridiculous reading of a study that actually found the opposite: Mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.

Donald Trump","Trump’s ridiculous statement about “total” authority neglects Constitution




If Your Time is short





Trump claimed that “numerous provisions” of the U.S. Constitution give him the power to open or close state economies, but he didn’t cite any specifically.


Legal experts said that the U.S. Constitution does not give Trump “total” power over the states, even during an emergency such as a pandemic.


States maintain police powers and the authority to set rules related to public health, such as social distancing and business closures.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump was asked during his White House briefing to explain his tweets in which he said that it’s up to him — not governors — to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""What provision in the Constitution gives the president the power to open or close state economies?"" a reporter asked Trump April 13.
""Numerous provisions,"" Trump replied.  ""We’ll give you a legal brief if you want."" 
Reporters pressed Trump for details, but he never cited specific provisions in the Constitution or federal law.
When a reporter asked again, Trump said, ""The authority is total, and that’s the way it’s got to be.""
The White House did not respond to our emails seeking Trump’s evidence.
The 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states. A reporter asked Trump how he would overcome that restriction.
Trump sidestepped the question: ""Well if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election. They’re going to open. They’re going to all open.""
Trump does not have total authority
Federalism, which is a key component of our Constitution, means that the national government is responsible for broad governance, while states and cities have authority over local issues. 
The president is the top elected official in the country, but he does not have supreme power to dictate all rules for states and local governments. The federal government only has powers given to it in the U.S. Constitution; the rest are reserved for the states, said Polly J. Price, a professor of law and global health at Emory University. 
Trump does have some authority with respect to reopening the country such as on federal property including military bases within states, Price said.

But formal declaration of a ""national emergency"" does not confer do-whatever-is-needed authority on the president, said University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney. 
""The president very clearly does not have total authority over state and local governments,"" Chesney said. ""It is preposterous to claim such authority in our system, in which federalism has always been a bedrock element. It is equally preposterous to claim that state and local leaders require the president’s approval for anything. States are not mere political subdivisions of the federal government.""
Issues with respect to social distancing and business closures are state matters. That means that Trump does not actually call the shots about re-opening swimming pools in Miami, gyms in Sacramento or barber shops in Cleveland. Both Democratic and Republican governors have said they control their own state orders, not Trump. 
This isn’t the first time that Trump has made the case that he has unlimited power. In 2019, he said that Article 2 of the Constitution gave him ""the right to do whatever I want as president."" Article 2 gives the president ""executive power,"" but that’s not the same as total power over the states. 
Legal experts say no part of the Constitution gives the president unlimited power.
""There is no authority. You can’t point to any clause of the Constitution that supports that,"" said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and political science professor at Hamline University. 
When the framers drafted the Constitution, they kept in mind fear of King George III and wanted to avoid absolute power of a king, Schultz said. The Constitution aims to break up political power.
""That’s why the president doesn’t have total power,"" he said.
Our ruling
Trump said he has ""total"" authority to reopen the states amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump and the White House have not explained what parts of the Constitution or laws he is referring to that he thinks give him ""total"" authority over governors. 
Governors have the power to set rules to protect their residents’ public health such as closing swimming pools and schools and requiring social distancing. Trump does not have the power to undo the governors’ orders.

Facebook posts","Early date on CARES Act is due to a legislative quirk, not a plot




If Your Time is short



• The introduction date of the legislation that ultimately became the CARES Act doesn’t signify anything about when the government knew about the coronavirus pandemic.
• Tax-related bills need to originate in the House. But to speed the passage of coronavirus relief, the senators who drew up the CARES Act used a common workaround by which they stripped out the text of an existing House-passed bill and inserted the new text into it. 
• The House bill they used was introduced in 2019, and was unrelated to the coronavirus. The post misstated the introduction date.



See the sources for this fact-check




The coronavirus pandemic has generated a torrent of conspiracy theories. One of them is that the U.S. government somehow planned the pandemic.
An April 26 Facebook post sought to prove its case by showing a screenshot of a Wikipedia-like page describing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, more commonly known as the CARES Act. 
The $2.2 trillion act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, included direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures.
The page captured in the screenshot lists the bill as having been introduced on Jan. 24, 2017. That’s more than three years before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, which the post cites as evidence that the pandemic was a long-planned event.
The poster added the comment, ""Clearly a PLAN-DEMIC. Guess what they have planned next for you. Hint — None of it is in your best interest. Hint 2 — It's much worse than you could ever imagine.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
In reality, there’s a mundane explanation for why the bill was introduced well before the pandemic itself, and it has nothing to do with a government plot. But explaining it requires a short lesson in constitutional law and how Congress works.
Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution says that bills related to raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives before moving to the Senate for consideration.
Sometimes, lawmakers decide that revenue-related legislation must pass urgently, and the shortest path is to skip the normal House-to-Senate process.
That was the case with the CARES Act.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







While the Democratic House majority did offer a version of the bill, negotiators from the White House and the Senate were already deep into talks about what should be in the bill. When the Senate came up with a version of the bill that the leaders in both parties could support, they drew up the legislative text to be voted on.
However, because of the constitutional rule on tax-related bills, the senators didn’t create a new Senate bill. Instead, they took an existing bill that had been passed by the House but not by the Senate. The Senate stripped out the language, inserted the new CARES Act wording into the shell, and voted on it. It passed unanimously, and was later passed by the House and signed by President Donald Trump.
What the Senate did is a ""commonly used workaround,"" said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in legislative procedure.
The original House bill had been to repeal the ""Cadillac tax"" on high-cost insurance plans, which was part of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It was introduced on Jan. 24, 2019, (not 2017, as the image in the post says) and easily passed the House on July 17, 2019, 419-6.
The bill never made it to a vote in the Senate, making the measure ripe for the picking when Senate leaders went looking for a House-passed measure where the CARES Act language could be swapped in. The bill that passed the Senate ""bears zero resemblance to the original bill,"" Koger said. And the introduction date signifies nothing about when the government knew of the coronavirus.
This same tactic was used in the subsequent coronavirus response bill that added more funding for small-business loans, said Donald R. Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
The process used to enact the CARES Act, Koger said, shows that ""the modern Congress often bears little resemblance to the ‘How a Bill Becomes a Law’ lessons"" people learn in school.
Our ruling
Facebook posts said the government must have planned the coronavirus pandemic because the coronavirus relief bill had been introduced three years earlier.
The introduction date cited in the post was off by two years, and the post is a misunderstanding of how the bill moved through Congress. 
Because of a constitutional requirement that tax-related bills originate in the House, the senators who drew up the CARES Act used a common workaround, stripping an existing House-passed bill of its old text and inserting the new text into it. 
So there’s nothing fishy about a coronavirus relief bill having been introduced prior to the pandemic’s emergence. The original text of the bill that eventually became the CARES Act was on an entirely different topic.

A claim circulating on Facebook suggests a coronavirus outbreak roughly 100 times more deadly than authorities and the news media are letting on.
""CORONAVIRUS: Reports of 10,000 DEAD in Wuhan, China,"" reads a Jan. 24 story from the Geller Report. The website is run by Pamela Geller, an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, a far-right group.
This is just one of many false statements circulating on social media at what appears to be a break-neck pace – far faster than the spread of the health threat itself.
This latest post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
First, the Geller Report article is questionably sourced. It says that a guy named Bill Holter heard from a friend named Robert who heard from an American friend who heard from a Chinese friend who has relatives in Wuhan that ""there may already be ~10,000 dead there from the virus.""
But here’s what we know from credible sources about the Wuhan coronavirus:
According to a Jan. 26 report from the World Health Organization, more than 2,000 people have contracted the virus, the vast majority of whom live in China. More than 100 people in the United States are being evaluated for possible infection. According to the New York Times, 81 people have died, all of them in China.
The figure of 81 deaths was also reported by CBS News and other media.

As of 7 p.m. Eastern on Jan. 27, the figure reported by Johns Hopkins University, which is mapping the virus, was 82
However, as we were putting this fact-check together, Agence France-Presse, in a report carried by CBS, said the death toll, according to Chinese authorities, had reached 106. 
The South China Morning Post also reported the 106 figure and attributed it to Chinese authorities. 
So, while the death toll appears to be climbing, the Geller Report story is way, way off.

A claim circulating on Facebook says: ""CORONAVIRUS: Reports of 10,000 DEAD in Wuhan, China.""

Neither timeline is remotely accurate. House members file expenditure reports for all official foreign travel with the House clerk’s office. We searched reports for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 and found no trips by Pelosi to China. (Pelosi traveled to Jordan and Afghanistan in October, Spain in December and Luxembourg and Belgium in December. She visited Poland and Israel in January and Germany and Belgium in February.)
Pelosi’s spokesman said her last visit to China was in November 2015 when she visited Beijing. The U.S. delegation and Chinese officials discussed climate change, protection of cyberspace, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, human and women’s rights, and other topics, according to a press release from Pelosi’s office.
Other false Facebook posts have included a photo of Pelosi shaking the hand of a Chinese official.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump wrong about COVID-19 testing on airplanes, trains




If Your Time is short





The CDC is not testing passengers for COVID-19 as they get on or off airplanes and trains.


The federal government is screening certain passengers at 13 airports.


Screening can include looking for symptoms, but it’s not the same as a test.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump said he was considering whether to stop domestic travel between U.S. hotspots for COVID-19.
As he explained his reluctance to harm the transportation industry, Trump inaccurately said airline and train passengers were already being tested for the disease.
""We have to get our country back, we have to start moving again, we have to start working again,"" Trump said April 1. ""Now, they’re doing tests on airlines — very strong tests — for getting on, getting off. They’re doing tests on trains — getting on, getting off. But when you start closing up entire transportation systems and then opening them up, that’s a very tough thing to do.""
We asked the White House for evidence and did not get a response.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us it is not testing passengers at airports or train stations, a spokesperson told PolitiFact.
It’s possible that Trump was referring to screening of passengers, which is happening at 13 airports for international flights. That isn’t the same as testing.
Screening someone for symptoms can flag someone who could potentially have COVID-19, but it’s not as definitive as a test. It is impractical to test passengers at airports and train stations, given the slow delivery of most results and limited availability for people with symptoms.
The CDC screening includes a temperature and symptoms check for travelers coming from foreign countries. 
Airport screenings for some international travel began earlier in the crisis. The CDC announced Jan. 17 it would screen passengers from Wuhan, China, for COVID-19 at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports. The screenings have expanded to include 13 airports, including Miami, Chicago, Detroit and Boston. They primarily affect American citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate families who have recently been in China, Iran, or certain European countries.

Travelers returning from international travel are advised to stay home for 14 days, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.
Some states have implemented their own screening practices, with mixed results. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered screening (not testing) at Florida airports for passengers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Shortly after, some passengers told the Sun Sentinel that their temperatures were not taken and they saw no visible signs of screening. 
In Broward County, officials are collecting forms from passengers on certain flights from the New York tri-state area, said Greg Meyer, a spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
Representatives for airports in Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit said passengers were not taking tests as they board or exit airplanes.
""Screening may occur in airports, but testing does not,"" said Florence Brown, a spokeswoman for the airport in Philadelphia. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents are screening international travelers for visible signs of illness, such as coughing or having difficulty breathing, Brown said. International passengers from countries affected by COVID-19 may also receive a printed guide from the CDC.
We contacted spokespersons for multiple airlines and did not get a response. We did not hear back from Amtrak by deadline.

Passengers on planes and trains are not being tested for COVID-19. It’s possible that Trump was referring to screenings, which could include a temperature check or a questionnaire. But even screenings are not as widespread as he said; they are happening at 13 airports for certain countries.

Coronavirus







James Edming","Yes, data shows COVID-19 vaccines are safe despite quick timeline




If Your Time is short




Edming based his argument on an anecdote about another drug, but that was a hormone supplement, not a vaccine, and it was approved under far more lenient FDA requirements more than 80 years ago.

 
The timeline in this case was drastically sped up due to scientific cooperation and breakthroughs, ample funding and fast-tracked paperwork. But the vaccines still went through the normal testing and approval process.

 
The COVID-19 vaccines were together tested on more than 100,000 people (in addition to animals) before their release, following a standard three-phrase testing.

 
The most obvious evidence the vaccine is safe comes from the more than 100 million Americans who have received a dose so far, with minimal complications reported despite the massive sample size.




See the sources for this fact-check




State Rep. James Edming doesn’t trust the COVID-19 vaccine.
He even told a Wisconsin Assembly committee, ""we should eliminate"" it.
Explaining his objection, the 75-year-old Republican from Glen Flora, in rural northern Wisconsin, has repeatedly cited a personal anecdote, most recently in a March 23, 2021, floor session of the Wisconsin state Assembly.
As lawmakers debated several bills that would prohibit mandatory vaccinations, Edming told of a friend whose wife died of cancer.
""His wife was 70 years old, and 71 years ago, there was a vaccination that they gave women so they wouldn’t have a miscarriage, and his mother-in-law took that vaccination,"" Edming said. ""His mother-in-law died at age 70. His wife died at age 70, and their daughter is sterile.
""That’s what the research has been able to follow up on in 70 years, and you think I’m going to take something because some scientist says that it’s good for me. And looking at and listening to what my friend has to say, there’s got to be a little more research before I take something. There may be a vaccination that’s for this, but you can’t tell me they can solve this in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that. There hasn’t even been any animal research on this.""





Edming covers a lot of territory here. A few quick notes before we go deeper.


His anecdote references a treatment that has indeed proven to have tragic, long-term consequences. But it wasn’t a vaccine, and it was developed in very different circumstances more than 80 years ago. More on this later.


Edming is flat wrong about animal research. All three vaccines in use now in the U.S. were tested on animals in addition to the expansive human trials.


But we’ll focus mostly on the timing-based claim. Is it really not realistic to develop a safe vaccine in less than a year?
How the COVID-19 vaccines were developed
The most obvious rebuttal to Edming’s claim is that millions of Americans have been safely vaccinated.
The CDC requires all deaths following vaccinations to be reported, which sparks a review of the death certificate, autopsy and other documents to check for a connection. Through March 22, 2,216 deaths were reported among 126 million vaccine doses administered so far in the U.S. But that doesn’t mean those are tied to the vaccine. In a sample so large, there will be people who die of other causes and, according to the CDC, those documents ""revealed no evidence that vaccinations contributed to patient deaths."" 
Meanwhile, some people have reported side effects, including two to five per million who experience anaphylaxis — a severe allergic reaction.
But Edming’s criticism focused on the speed of the process, so let’s dig in to how the vaccines got to this point so quickly.
Defending Edming’s claim, his staff pointed to a vaccine history website from the College of Physicians of Philadelphia that says, ""Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years.""
However, the same website details CDC guidance on the COVID-19 vaccines, including this: ""Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.""
That gets to the heart of where Edming goes wrong.
The process that led to today’s COVID-19 vaccines is unlike anything that came before it. The unprecedented global consequences of the coronavirus pandemic spawned an equally unprecedented global cooperation in pursuit of a vaccine.
This was made possible by a new method of developing vaccines, mass numbers of infections that accelerated clinical trials and governments willing to eliminate bureaucratic and financial roadblocks, the New York Times reported. While the vaccine process involved breakthroughs, they were built on research that goes back decades.

Emails show that Fauci knew ""hydroxychloroquine worked [and] emailed friends about it being effective.""












By Andy Nguyen • June 15, 2021












""These vaccines were fast-tracked, but the parts that were fast-tracked were the paperwork; so the administrative approvals, the time to get the funding,"" Dr. Andrew Badley, COVID-19 Research Task Force Chair at the Mayo Clinic, said in a video produced by the hospital system. ""Because these vaccines have such great interest, the time it took to enroll patients was very, very fast. The follow-up was as thorough as it is for any vaccine.""
Each of the three vaccines now in use in the U.S. went through the standard three phases of human testing. Stage 3 testing conducted prior to receiving emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration involved 43,448 people for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 30,420 people for Moderna and 43,783 people for Johnson & Johnson.
The FDA describes the process this way on its website:
""In public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, the development process may be atypical. For example, as demonstrated by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has coalesced government agencies, international counterparts, academia, nonprofit organizations and pharmaceutical companies to develop a coordinated strategy for prioritizing and speeding development of the most promising vaccines. In addition, the federal government has made investments in the necessary manufacturing capacity at its own risk, giving companies confidence that they can invest aggressively in development and allowing faster distribution of an eventual vaccine. However, efforts to speed vaccine development to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have not sacrificed scientific standards, integrity of the vaccine review process, or safety.""
In the U.S., that government funding came from Operation Warp Speed, an initiative launched under the Trump Administration that laid out $18 billion to accelerate vaccine development and manufacturing.
Steps to speed the process included beginning large-scale manufacturing during clinical trials, running some phases of clinical trials at the same time and investing in multiple types of vaccines to increase the chances of success, according to a February 2021 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Among the six potential vaccines Operation Warp Speed invested in, two used messenger RNA, two used viral vector technology that deploys an altered cold virus and two focused on the virus’s spike protein.
The first two vaccines approved here — Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — are particularly noteworthy in their use of messenger RNA, a new approach to vaccine creation. Vaccines built on mRNA have a general structure into which the genetic code needed to address a virus can be quickly loaded, rather than developing an entire vaccine from scratch. Moderna likens the process to loading a program or app into a computer’s operating system.
Drs. Sabrina Murphy and Maggie Nolan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health reviewed research on the matter at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin.
""There have been over three decades of mRNA vaccine research and development on vaccines for other disease such as influenza, Zika virus, and rabies virus. Additionally, mRNA-based cancer vaccines have been used in numerous cancer clinical trials with promising results,"" the doctors said in a joint statement. ""The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine development was actually preceded by decades of research into understanding the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines and has made the COVID-19 vaccine a miracle of circumstances. It has allowed for a COVID-19 vaccine to be developed and tested much more rapidly.""
The anecdote
Before we wrap up, let’s circle back to the anecdote Edming cited. It’s the same story he shared in a March 3 hearing before the Committee on Constitution and Ethics, where he recalled the friend’s deceased wife as an ""awesome, awesome lady.""
Tyler Longsine, a research assistant for Edming, said they didn’t know the nature of the drug involved — despite Edming’s repeated use of the story.
But experts consulted by PolitiFact Wisconsin say his description lines up with the history of a drug called Diethylstilbestrol, or DES. It’s a hormone supplement that was given to between 5 and 10 million women as a pill, injection, cream or suppository from the 1940s to the 1970s, the CDC reported. Doctors believed it would prevent miscarriages.
The National Institutes of Health said few studies were done on the drug before it was produced, however, causing it to be given to women worldwide in inconsistent doses. DES was in use long before a sweeping 1962 bill overhauled FDA drug approval requirements, making manufacturers prove the effectiveness of drugs before marketing them.
By 1953, research had shown DES did not prevent miscarriages or premature birth. But many doctors continued using it until research in early 1970s revealed children exposed to DES in utero were more likely to suffer from infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues — in line with Edming’s story.
As tragic as this outcome was for Edming’s friend and countless other families, their situation is not comparable to the COVID-19 vaccine. DES was a medication, not a vaccine. And it was developed 82 years ago under looser standards that led it to be administered erratically.
""The only similarity between DES and vaccines is that both may be given through injection,"" Murphy and Nolan said in their statement. ""We give many medications by injection — think of insulin, for example — and they have nothing to do with vaccines.""
Our ruling
In a speech detailing his distrust of scientists and the COVID-19 vaccine, Edming said, ""You can’t tell me they can (develop a safe vaccine) in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that.""
Edming leaned on criticism of a medical treatment — not a vaccine — developed in the 1930s and released without a fraction of the scientific scrutiny given to the COVID-19 vaccines.
And in any case, his conclusion is contrary to the overwhelming medical consensus and what we can clearly see from the worldwide rollout. Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (with others on the way) were able to develop as quickly as they did due to a breakthrough vaccine mechanism, billions in federal funding and an array of bureaucratic fast-tracking that allowed faster production, simultaneous trials and timely approvals.
Those vaccines were together tested on more than 100,000 people. And with millions of people now safely and effectively vaccinated, we see that safety claims made based on the trials were indeed valid. Which makes Edming’s claim ridiculous.

Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines continues to run rampant online, even as President Joe Biden addressed the nation on March 11 and instructed states to make all adults eligible for the vaccines by May 1. 
In one nearly nine-minute Facebook video, which appeared to have originally been recorded in French before being dubbed over with an English translation, the speaker makes some outrageous claims. 
""Here is the truth about the vaccine that the new world order wants to impose on us all,"" the narrator says, before going on to claim that the COVID-19 vaccines will contain ""nanoparticles."" 
The English-language narrator describes nanoparticles as ""a bit like a microchip implanted under your cat or dog’s skin. The difference is you’re going to find thousands, millions of them in just one vaccine dose.""
The claims about the vaccine don’t stop there, though. The narrator continues: ""The vaccine and the nanoparticles are mixed in the syringe. The vaccine and the nanoparticles are then injected simultaneously into your body. From that moment on, your mobile phone will locate you immediately. And by the magic of 5G network, your location is no longer a secret to the authorities.""

There is no evidence the approved COVID-19 vaccines contain nanoparticles similar to microchips implanted in pets that would allow recipients to be tracked via the 5G network. 
Versions of the claim have been checked by other fact-checking organizations, and French publications have debunked the original video. 
The video posits the idea that ""nanoparticles"" are actually small robots or computers — a notion we saw emerge from another viral video about vaccines that was later debunked.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The term ""nanoparticles"" refers to ""materials with dimensions in the nanoscale,"" according to a study published on the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s website. It refers to the size of a particle, and nothing else.
The ingredients of the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S. have been released publicly (Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson).
Lipid nanoparticles are included on the list of ingredients in the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. 
Lipids are molecules such as fats or oils that aren’t soluble in water. In the vaccines, lipid nanoparticles encase, protect and transport the mRNA — essentially acting as ""tiny ‘delivery vehicles,’"" according to one biotechnology company that helped develop them. 
Nanoparticles are not microchip technology, nor do they have any connection to 5G networks.
Furthermore, there is no evidence the vaccines contain any sort of technology that would allow someone who has been vaccinated to be ""located"" using 5G. Conspiracy theories about the coronavirus and 5G networks aren’t new, and several have been fact-checked and debunked since the start of the pandemic.

Bloggers","Former Pfizer employee wrong that coronavirus pandemic is ‘effectively over’ in UK




If Your Time is short





The coronavirus pandemic is not “effectively over” in the United Kingdom, and it was not nearing its end point in October when a former Pfizer employee claimed it was. 


New cases have surged in the U.K. over the last several months. The U.K. recently became the first country to approve the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for distribution.


The U.K. and other countries remain a long way from achieving herd immunity without a vaccine, experts said. It’s wrong to say there’s “no need for vaccines.”





See the sources for this fact-check




As Pfizer landed approval to begin distributing its COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom, a former company employee’s wrong claims downplaying the pandemic recirculated online.
The social media posts rely on statements made by Michael Yeadon, who argued in an Oct. 16 blog post that the coronavirus pandemic is ""effectively over"" in the U.K., and that ""there is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic.""
The posts suggest that Yeadon’s connection to Pfizer makes his views on the pandemic and vaccines credible. 
""This is a factual article from a factual publication by a factual doctor who happens to be one of the utmost leading expert(s) on vaccines in the world,"" one Instagram post said.
""Here we have it,"" another post on Facebook said. ""The company making the vaccine saying the pandemic is over and healthy people do not need a vaccine.""
But Yeadon hasn’t worked for Pfizer in nine years, according to the Associated Press and his LinkedIn profile. He was formerly the chief scientific officer of allergy and respiratory research, his profile says.
And his claims are wrong, experts told PolitiFact. So are the social media posts that spread them. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The coronavirus pandemic is far from over in the U.K. and in other countries, as case spikes in recent months have shown. A widespread vaccine could prevent future waves, experts said.
The Associated Press also debunked Yeadon’s statements. Fact-checkers with Lead Stories and Health Feedback previously addressed similarly inaccurate claims he made in a separate blog post and in an interview with a talk radio host in the U.K.
PolitiFact’s efforts to contact Yeadon were unsuccessful. 
The pandemic is not ""effectively over"" in the U.K.
Yeadon’s claim that the pandemic is ""effectively over"" is at odds with data showing that the U.K. was among the many countries where cases rose over the last several months. 
The U.K. saw a sharp surge in daily confirmed cases between September and mid-November, when the numbers began to fall again as stricter restrictions were introduced. The country is still reporting tens of thousands of new cases each day, along with hundreds of deaths daily.

In total, the coronavirus has infected more than 1.6 million people in the U.K. to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data. It has killed nearly 60,000.
""If Dr. Yeadon’s claim were true that the pandemic is effectively over, then the number of cases in various countries should be leveling off or dropping,"" said Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Days before Yeadon published his blog post on Oct. 16, the U.K.’s deputy chief medical officer warned in an op-ed that the nation was ""at a tipping point similar to where we were in March.""
Indeed, confirmed cases in the U.K. were already ""on the upswing"" in mid-October, said Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist in medicine at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine. They have increased substantially in the roughly six weeks since, Bruce said.
Many other countries have experienced similar trends as colder weather has sent more people indoors. The U.S. reported over 1 million new cases in the first 10 days of November. 
Scientists say vaccines are critical
Yeadon’s claim about vaccines is also wrong. ""There is definitely still a need for vaccines,"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. 
In his blog post, Yeadon argued that more people are immune to COVID-19 than the U.K.’s scientists recognize, because many were previously infected with other coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
That, he insisted, meant both the U.K. and the world are close to achieving herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when enough people are immune to a virus to limit new infections and spread. 
But experts told PolitiFact that Yeadon was leaping to conclusions.
""Whether prior infection with a seasonal coronavirus confers protection from SARS-CoV-2 is still not a settled question,"" Bruce said. ""While recent work indicates that it is possible that some cross protection (particularly from T cells) exists, this is not yet fully understood.""
""The immune system tends to be very specific, so exposure to related viruses does not necessarily result in protection from all of those related viruses,"" Watanabe added.
Herd immunity generally requires greater than 70% of a population to be immune, Watanabe said. But experts agreed that’s a long way away without a vaccine.
What we know about current case trends and the number of people who have been infected suggests that ""vaccination would be required to prevent future waves,"" Nichols said. 
Even if herd immunity were reached without widespread vaccination, she said, anyone who has not been infected would remain susceptible to the virus unless they got a vaccine. 
RELATED: What we know about COVID-19 and immunity
Our ruling
In a blog post that has sparked several widespread social media posts, Yeadon claimed the pandemic is ""effectively over"" in the U.K. and ""there is absolutely no need for vaccines.""
Both points are inaccurate and at odds with the realities of the pandemic, which has upended lives and killed over 1.4 million people globally. Confirmed daily case counts were rising in the U.K. at the time of Yeadon’s claim and remain in the tens of thousands. People are still dying.
Experts said that COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to mount in the absence of widespread mitigation measures until a vaccine is distributed.

Fauci was the first CEO of Moderna.


Fauci and Gates were roommates at Cornell.


""It was at Cornell that Bill Gates designed the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patented it under US2006257852.""


""Moderna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben. IG Farben is infamous for it's mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust.""


After World War II, IG Farben was ""dissolved and its assets sold off by a Nazi turned American by the name of, you guessed it, George Soros.""


""Soros rebranded the company as Moderna.""

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Moderna Inc. has no link to IG Farben
No, Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna Inc. does not trace its lineage to Germany. It was founded in 2010 with the mission of studying a technology known as mRNA to develop new pharmaceuticals and launched operations in 2011. Moderna is in phase 3 of a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine.
IG Farben––formally known in German as Interessengemeinschaft Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft––was a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate established in 1925 and made up of four other German companies: BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Bayer AG, Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft, and Agfa-Gevaert Group, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. 
The company did create a synthetic oil and rubber plant in Auschwitz and used inmates for drug experiments during World War II, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. But after the war, the Allied powers charged top executives with war crimes, and the company was divided into three: Hoechst, Bayer and BASF.
We find no indication that IG Farben has any connection to Moderna. Moderna did not respond to our inquiries.
Anthony Fauci was never CEO of Moderna
Anthony Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health has taken a leading public role in the coronavirus pandemic. He was never CEO of Moderna. He graduated from Weill Cornell Medical College in 1966 and began working for the NIAID two years after graduating, according to multiple sources including the Cornell Daily Sun and the NIH.
He has spent the rest of his career in the public sector. Fauci was named director of the institute in 1984 and has overseen research to prevent, diagnose and treat HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and malaria. 
Gates and Fauci roomies? No.
Gates and Fauci were not roommates at Cornell. First, Fauci was 14 when Gates was born in 1955. Second, Gates didn’t attend Cornell. He studied for two years at Harvard University beginning in 1973. By that time, Fauci was already working for the NIH. Gates later dropped out of Harvard and founded Microsoft.
RELATED: No, Fauci wasn’t on the Clinton Foundation board for two decades
Facts wrong on radio-frequency ID tag
Gates also didn’t have a role in patenting the radio-frequency identification tag chips mentioned in the post. Mario Cardullo was the first to patent the tag in 1973.  And while the patent number ""US2006257852"" cited in the post is a real patent, it’s not for the RFID tag. It’s a patent related to the disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS).
Soros was not a Nazi
PolitiFact, along with other fact-checkers, has debunked claims that George Soros was a Nazi. Soros survived the Holocaust. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, Soros’ father obtained a false identity for Soros and sent him to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson, according to the New York Times. Soros also did not buy the assets of IG Farben and disguise the company under Moderna. In 1945, when the Allied powers split up IG Farben, Soros was a teenager.  
Jeffrey Epstein not a primary Moderna stockholder 
Epstein began working at Bear Stearns in 1976 and was promoted to partner in 1980, according to the Miami Herald. In 1982, he opened his own money management firm called J Epstein and Co., where he ""would manage the individual and family fortunes of clients with $1 billion or more,"" according to a 2002 New York Magazine profile on Epstein. In the late 1990s, he renamed the firm to Financial Trust Company and moved the headquarters to the U.S. Virgin Islands to receive a tax break, according to the New York Times. 
When Moderna was established in 2010, Epstein was serving a one-year probation after being convicted of sex offenses in 2008, contrary to the post. In 2012, he created a start-up business, Southern Trust, to develop algorithms and mine DNA and financial databases, according to the New York Times. The company managed to pay a tax rate of about 3.9% after generating a $300 million profit in 2013, and its corporate filings show no clients, according to the article. He would also start his own international bank, but it’s unclear whether it had any customers. 
Neither Epstein, nor his management firm, are listed as one of the primary stockholders in Moderna, according to CNN Business and the Wall Street Journal. We found no indication that Epstein was one of the primary stockholders in Moderna when he died on Aug. 10, 2019. He was awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges when he committed suicide in his prison cell.

Conspiracies about mainstream news media are flourishing amid the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""What a bunch of BS,"" screamed a Facebook post about a news photo from a Wisconsin rally against stay-at-home orders.
Sharing two images from the demonstration, the post essentially claims the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel doctored a photo to put a Confederate Battle Flag in the hands of one protester.
But the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel did not alter its photo.  
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Here’s what happened.
The Journal Sentinel, which publishes PolitiFact Wisconsin, posted a news story about the April 18 rally in Brookfield, a Milwaukee suburb. Nearly 1,000 people packed the sidewalk adjacent to a busy thoroughfare, most shoulder to shoulder, to protest Gov. Tony Evers’ decision to extend Wisconsin’s safer-at-home order until May 26.
The Facebook post shows two photographs from the rally side by side — one from the Journal Sentinel and one said to be taken by the poster’s daughter. 
The Journal Sentinel photo shows a man wearing a plaid shirt and jeans among a group of people and holding two flags — a Confederate flag and just above it, a yellow flag that is harder to make out. 
The other photo with the post shows a man, also in a plaid shirt and jeans, who is not so close to other people. He is clearly holding only a yellow flag.
The implication is that in its photo, the Journal Sentinel added the Confederate flag into the man’s hands.
What you’re really seeing
The two-flag photo is one of 13 images in a photo gallery that accompanied the Journal Sentinel’s news story about the protest. 
After Facebook posts appeared making the specious claim, the Journal Sentinel published an article denying that its photo was doctored. The article explained what happened:

On April 18, the reporter who wrote the news story sent the photo in question from his iPhone to an editor who loaded it directly into the Journal Sentinel's publishing system.
The photo shows the man holding a yellow Don't Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag together on one pole. 
On April 19, a Journal Sentinel photo editor examined the photo and determined it was never edited in Photoshop, even to receive the basic color-toning for reproduction.
The article also pointed out that other images taken at the rally, including two videos posted on social media, show a man with the two flags.

(Confederate flag is visible at the 9-second mark in this tweeted video.)
One video shows a man wearing a plaid shirt and baseball cap, holding just a Don't Tread on Me flag, a few feet away from the man holding the Don’t Tread on Me and the Confederate flags. 
Another video also shows a Confederate flag flying below a Don't Tread on Me flag, with another Don't Tread on Me flag nearby.
The Journal Sentinel reporter on the scene also captured an image in which both men can be seen. The photos are time-stamped at 11:40 and 11:41 a.m.
PolitiFact did an Error Level Analysis on the image in question, using FotoForensics, and found that the flags and the people were part of the same JPEG compression. The photo’s metadata also does not show that Photoshop was used.
In English: There’s no forensic evidence that the image was doctored. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post showing two photographs from a rally that protested coronavirus stay-at-home orders suggests that one of the photos, taken by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, was doctored.
Our analysis found the photo, which shows one man holding a Don’t Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag, was not altered. The person is visible in several other posts we found that were not from the newspaper.

Sherri Tenpenny","COVID-19 vaccine does not cause death, autoimmune diseases




If Your Time is short





There is no evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for emergency use in the U.S. cause autoimmune diseases or death.


Clinical trials — which lasted months and included tens of thousands of participants — indicated no connection between the vaccines and autoimmune diseases.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Joe Biden says the U.S. will have enough coronavirus vaccines for all adults by the end of May. On social media, anti-vaccine advocates falsely say that effort could lead to autoimmune diseases and death.
A Feb. 9 video features former Nevada City, Calif., Mayor Reinette Senum and Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an osteopathic physician. Over the course of an hour, the two women characterize the coronavirus vaccine as ""deadly"" and a ""bioweapon."" The video was published on Bitchute, a video platform similar to YouTube, but one that researchers say hosts large amounts of hate speech and disinformation.
A PolitiFact reader asked us to fact-check the video. One claim in particular stuck out:
""Some people are going to die from the vaccine directly,"" Tenpenny said in the video, which has nearly 1 million views. ""But a large number of people are going to start getting horribly sick and get all kinds of autoimmune diseases, 42 days to maybe a year out.""
The video was also flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times on the platform — despite Facebook’s ban on anti-vaccine content.

(Screenshot from Bitchute)
Tenpenny is wrong. There is no evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. cause autoimmune diseases or death.
Tenpenny is a licensed osteopathic physician based in suburban Cleveland and the author of ""Saying No To Vaccines: A Resource Guide for All Ages."" She runs an alternative health clinic and has previously said vaccines cause autism, a claim public health officials have debunked. Her Facebook page was removed in December for spreading misinformation, but her Instagram account still has more than 126,000 followers.
During her interview with Senum — who stepped down from the Nevada City council in July after saying she would not enforce a statewide mask mandate — Tenpenny cited an article she published Dec. 28 on Vaxxter, an anti-vaccine website.
In that article, Tenpenny linked to a study about a phenomenon in other coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, in which certain antibodies can actually worsen the disease. The study does not support her claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause autoimmune diseases, which include conditions like type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis that cause the body to mistakenly attack healthy cells and organs.

“Fauci’s emails leaked.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







Public health agencies say the coronavirus vaccine is safe and effective.
The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to three coronavirus vaccines: one from Pfizer-BioNTech, one from Moderna, and one from Janssen, a pharmaceutical company owned by Johnson & Johnson. Clinical trials — which lasted months and included tens of thousands of participants — indicated no connection between the vaccines and autoimmune diseases.
The FDA found ""no specific safety concerns"" associated with any of the three vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that safety data does not apply to people with autoimmune conditions, but the vaccines are still recommended.
Millions of Americans have received the coronavirus vaccines. If they caused widespread autoimmune diseases, those instances would be documented in the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. But the system indicates only a handful of self-reported autoimmune diseases, and even that data is unverified.
""While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness,"" the CDC says. ""The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.""
There have been reports of people who received the coronavirus vaccines and later died. But that doesn’t mean the vaccine killed them — the vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people.
We reached out to Tenpenny for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
Her claim is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!
CORRECTION: This story was updated June 15, 2021, to correct an error regarding Tenpenny's profession. She is an osteopathic physician.

President Donald Trump has touted how quickly the government is developing potential COVID-19 vaccines. An article circulating on Facebook gives him even more credit.

""The president of the United States of America will officially make the announcement about the vaccine to cure the virus on Sunday,"" reads the article, which includes a purported photo of the vaccine. ""Roche medical company will launch the vaccine on Sunday.""

The stories, published on spam websites registered in West Africa, are bogus.
Trump did not announce a vaccine on Sunday, March 29, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infections. Several other fact-checkers have debunked the false news articles. While clinical trials have started for some potential vaccines, they are still at least a year away from being completed.
The image in the article claims to show a COVID-19 vaccine, but it’s actually a testing kit developed by a Korean biotechnology company. Similar out-of-context images have circulated in India and Pakistan.
Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, has been shipping coronavirus tests to the U.S. and testing a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis for potential application in severe COVID-19 cases. The company has not developed a coronavirus vaccine.

During a March 29 press briefing, Trump said potential COVID-19 vaccines ""are moving along very rapidly.""
The first clinical trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine began in Seattle in mid March. The trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers over about six weeks, according to the National Institutes of Health. The potential vaccine was developed by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and biotechnology company Moderna, Inc.
RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic
In a March 30 press release, the Department of Health and Human Services said it is accelerating clinical trials of that vaccine, as well as another potential COVID-19 vaccine from Janssen Research & Development. But the first phase of the latter trial is set to begin ""no later than fall of 2020 with the goal of making COVID-19 vaccine available for emergency use in the United States in early 2021,"" according to HHS.
During his March 11 testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee on the coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, laid out a timeline for developing a COVID-19 vaccine. He said phase one will take about three months to determine if it’s safe, then phase two, during which scientists will test whether the vaccine works, could take another eight months at least.
He cautioned that any process that moves faster than that could be dangerous.
""So when you’ve heard me say we would not have a vaccine that would even be ready to start to deploy for a year to a year and a half, that is the time frame,"" Fauci told representatives. ""Now anyone who thinks that it will go more quickly than that I believe will be cutting corners that would be detrimental.""
Public domain records show that some of the websites spreading the bogus articles about a new coronavirus vaccine are registered in Ghana and Nigeria. Both countries have recently been linked to Russian disinformation campaigns, and websites associated with Russia and China have amplified conspiracies about the coronavirus in the past few weeks. Other stories were published by shell websites and promoted on Opera News Hub, a content creation platform that’s popular in Nigeria.

DeSantis’ office did not respond to a request for comment.





See the sources for this fact-check




Health officials have long said that the novel coronavirus is particularly dangerous for older individuals and people with underlying health conditions.
But Florida Gov. Ron Desantis made an even more staggering claim, that the virus hasn’t killed anyone under 25 in the United States.
""This particular pandemic is one where I don’t think nationwide, there’s been a single fatality under 25,"" DeSantis said during an April 9 meeting to discuss reopening Florida schools. ""For whatever reason, it just doesn’t seem to threaten kids.
""And we lose in Florida between five and 10 kids a year for the flu. This one (coronavirus), for whatever reason, much more dangerous if you're 65 and plus than the flu, no doubt about that, if you're younger it just hasn't had an impact. So that should factor into how we're viewing this. I think the data on that has been 100% consistent. I have not seen any deviation on that.""

This is inaccurate. Florida hasn’t yet reported any deaths of COVID-19 patients under the age of 25, but several Americans in that age group have been killed by the virus. 
PolitiFact reached out to Desantis’ office for comment but did not hear back.
So far, the federal government’s count shows that four people between 15 and 24, and one child between the ages of 1 and 4, have died from the virus.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







This is an undercount, because it takes ""several weeks"" for death records to be processed. Reports by news organizations and various state health departments show more fatalities among younger Americans, though it’s hard to say with precision.
New York state reported that 42 people who were 29 years or younger have died from the virus, as of April 10. Of those, six were 19 or younger and 36 deaths were people between 20 and 29 years old.
A Washington Post investigation identified nine people under 20 who died from COVID-19. The newspaper found 45 deaths of people in their 20s. 
All told, death remains rare for young, otherwise healthy people, but these numbers show it can and has happened. Relatively few children with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and they often exhibit milder symptoms, health experts say. Like adults, they can unknowingly spread the disease to others.
Our ruling

Donald Trump","Trump blames past administrations for a flawed COVID-19 test. The test couldn’t have existed earlier




If Your Time is short





China reported a totally new viral disease, now called COVID-19, on Dec. 31, 2019.


The U.S. government began sending test kits out on Feb. 5, 2020.


There was no inherited test because a test couldn’t be created until the new virus had emerged. 





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump deflected blame for the slow start of testing for the new coronavirus in the United States.
""We inherited a broken test,"" he said on Fox News’ ""Fox and Friends"" March 30. 
Trump said much the same the day before during a Rose Garden press conference.
""We took over a dead, barren system,"" Trump said. ""That didn’t work, because when CDC first looked at their test, the biggest problem they had is, the test didn’t work. That wasn’t from us. That’s been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world.""
Trump’s assertion that the test ""wasn’t from us,"" gets things backwards. There could be no test for the virus that causes COVID-19 until the virus emerged. 
Trump’s claim that his administration inherited a broken test ""doesn’t make sense,"" said infectious disease researcher Christopher Mores at George Washington University’s School of Public Health.
""The (Centers for Disease Control) designed it and validated it and deployed it,"" Mores said. ""It has since been found to have multiple problems and has been changed to address some of these.""
China officially reported the new disease Dec. 31, 2019. It sent a genetic map of the viral DNA to the world community Jan. 7, 2020.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""

Within 10 days, a German lab had published a recipe for a test to detect the virus. The World Health Organization adopted that test and began helping low- and middle-income countries roll it out.
RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic
The first case of COVID-19 appeared in the United States on Jan. 21, and by Feb. 5, the CDC was sending test kits to state health agencies. But there was a hitch. The tests needed clean reagents, chemicals essential to providing reliable results. Some of the reagents were tainted and states had to send their samples to be tested back to the CDC.
All of this cost public health officials precious time learning how far the coronavirus had spread. By mid February, CDC and state labs had tested just under 2,200 samples. This was at a time when South Korea had performed over 7,900 tests. 
According to the COVID Tracking Project, by March 29, the country had conducted more than 831,000 tests.
Trump has incorrectly blamed the Obama administration for creating a policy that hamstrung the development of a testing regime. It is true that Food and Drug Administration rules slowed the process for private labs, but that practice dated back to the days of the President George W. Bush administration. Trump also falsely said the WHO had a bad test. Three independent labs validated that test.
We asked the White House how a previous administration could be responsible for a test created three years into the Trump presidency. We did not hear back.

Trump said that his administration inherited a broken test. That flies in the face of logic. There could be no test until the virus emerged.

 “U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







mRNA stands for messenger RNA. Most vaccines put weakened or inactivated germs in the body to activate an immune response, but mRNA vaccines don’t. Instead, they tell human cells how to make the spike protein that’s present on coronavirus virions. That protein trains the body’s immune system to create antibodies, which can prevent future COVID-19 infection.
Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use mRNA to inoculate people against the coronavirus. On its website, Moderna likens the technology to an ""operating system on a computer.""
""It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs,"" the company says. ""In our case, the ‘program’ or ‘app’ is our mRNA drug — the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein.""
That’s a metaphor — mRNA vaccines aren’t literally operating systems. 
The instructions contained in mRNA vaccines degrade quickly once they’re inside immune cells. We’ve previously debunked claims that mRNA vaccines alter people’s DNA and control them. Conspiracy theories accusing Gates of a nefarious coronavirus vaccination scheme have circulated since last spring.

A few days after President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency and cautioned against gathering in groups, a Facebook post accusing the government of being ""up to something"" went viral in Pennsylvania.
Here’s the full post:
""Is anyone paying attention to the bigger picture? And not what the media is feeding you? This virus is a distraction from the truth. Coming through Pennsylvania and stopped at a store and they have stopped selling gun ammo until further notice and all the cases are full so it’s not like they have run out. They are closing liquor stores. Next will be the banks. Then our phones will stop working. They don’t want venues of 50 or more people because they would have trouble trying to control 50-plus people. Something’s not right here and everyone is dumb enough to think it’s really just a virus. The numbers are nothing compared to H1N1 or Ebola. Everyone needs to realize our government is up to something and we are dumb enough to believe what you see on TV or on Facebook. Everyone better stock up on defense supplies because that toilet paper isn’t going to protect you when they come.""
Before we go any further, let’s get one thing straight – the coronavirus is real.
The number of cases in the U.S. and the grim tally of deaths caused by the virus climbs exponentially every day, and the restrictions that drew skepticism from this Facebook user are the very measures that public health experts say will help slow the virus’ spread.
There’s a lot to unpack in this misleading Facebook post, so we’ll take the claims one by one.
When the post first appeared on March 16, there were no restrictions on the sale of guns or ammunition in Pennsylvania, and customers anxious about the coronavirus flooded firearms dealers. Then Gov. Tom Wolf ordered gun sellers and other businesses not deemed ""life-sustaining"" to close their doors. But he quickly reversed course under pressure from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and allowed them to reopen so long as the shops agreed to keep customers six feet apart.
The Trump administration also advised states to consider gun sellers and shooting ranges essential businesses – on par with grocery stores and pharmacies.
The post gets one thing right. Pennsylvania did initially close liquor stores, which are state run.
Liquor stores reopened on Wednesday for online sales, but demand was so overwhelming that the Pennsylvania Fine Wine and Good Spirits website was unavailable for most users. The state liquor control board said access to the site would be ""randomized"" to prevent it from crashing.

Says Anthony Fauci will make millions off new book.












By Samantha Putterman • June 15, 2021







The Facebook user also warned that the government would soon close banks and cut the phone lines.
There’s no evidence of this.
Banks appear on Wolf’s list of life-sustaining businesses allowed to remain open, although some bank branches have closed voluntarily to keep customers and staff safe and others have reduced their hours or moved to drive-through service. Telecommunications companies like Philadelphia’s Comcast are easing shutoffs and waiving late fees to accommodate customers.
Next the post argues that new rules against gathering in large groups are designed to prevent people from organizing. Really they’re the most important tool government officials have to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which scientists say is far more contagious than the flu. Pennsylvanians who defy the rules now risk arrest, and in New Jersey, 15 men who attended an ultra-Orthodox Jewish funeral were charged Wednesday with violating that state’s ban on large gatherings.
Finally, the post suggests that coronavirus numbers don’t compare to H1N1 or Ebola, but top government scientists now predict that the coronavirus will be far deadlier than either of those diseases.
During the H1N1 outbreak that started in 2009, more than 12,000 people in the U.S. died.
About a dozen people were sickened with Ebola in 2014, but no one died.
Last week, members of the Trump administration leading the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak announced that the deadly pathogen could kill between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans. So far, nearly 5,000 people have died – 90 of them in Pennsylvania.
Our ruling
State-run liquor stores did close in Pennsylvania as government officials scrambled to halt the spread of the coronavirus, but all the other claims made in this post are false.
Most importantly, any suggestion that the coronavirus isn’t real or that it’s part of a government conspiracy is a ridiculous claim.

If Your Time is short




The North Carolina Republican Party tweeted that Gov. Cooper, a Democrat, hadn't left the Executive Mansion since the coronavirus pandemic started.
Cooper has left the mansion numerous times since March, and made many public appearances.
The NC GOP said it's tweet was meant ""metaphorically,"" but the tweet didn't include a reference to any alternative meaning.




See the sources for this fact-check




Add North Carolina’s governor to the list of politicians accused of hiding from the public.
During campaign season, Republicans on several occasions accused Democrats of hiding in their basements amid the coronavirus pandemic. That trend continued the Sunday after Christmas, when the North Carolina GOP tweeted about Gov. Roy Cooper.
""Democrat Governor @RoyCooperNC has not left the Governor's Mansion since the start of the #COVID19 crisis,"" the party tweeted on Dec. 27.
Compared to similar claims and barbs, this particular tweet stood out.
For one, North Carolina’s gubernatorial race is over. Incumbent Cooper defeated Republican Dan Forest by about 250,000 votes — or about 4 percentage points — over a month ago. Second, the North Carolina Republican Party’s claim is very specific. 
So is it true that Cooper hasn’t left the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh since March, when the pandemic started?
No. There are numerous examples of Cooper leaving the executive mansion.
On Dec. 21, less than a week before the NC GOP’s tweet, Cooper visited Duke Hospital to see health care workers receive COVID-19 vaccinations. He did the same at UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill on Dec. 17.
Earlier this month, he toured a factory in Pittsboro that makes personal protective equipment. And in November, he toured a face shield production line.

Cooper met with residents in August, when he visited Windsor in Bertie County after the town was hit by a tornado.
He has held multiple press conferences about the coronavirus pandemic from the Emergency Management building across town from the executive mansion.
Cooper also made a couple of high-profile appearances on the campaign trail in October, debating Forest at a studio in Research Triangle Park and greeting Joe Biden at RDU-International Airport.
We know the NC GOP is aware of Cooper’s trip to the airport because it issued a press release about his conversation with Biden.
The list of trips in this fact-check is not comprehensive. So why did the NC GOP tweet that Cooper hasn’t left his house?
Party spokesman Tim Wigginton told PolitiFact NC that the tweet is not meant to be taken literally.
""The tweet is meant metaphorically,"" Wigginton said, adding that it’s meant to critique the frequency of Cooper’s visits with business owners. He accused Cooper of living ""in a bubble … instead of meeting with people devastated by his orders."" 
The NC GOP’s tweet gave no indication that the party was calling on Cooper to meet with business owners.
Our ruling
The NC GOP tweeted that Cooper ""has not left the Governor's Mansion since the start of the (COVID-19) crisis.""

• The field hospitals set up in tents in New York’s Central Park were treating coronavirus patients from the Mount Sinai Health System. 
• There is no evidence that children are being held in, or released from, underground captivity in New York.
• This conspiracy has been researched and debunked by other news outlets.



See the sources for this fact-check




As the early epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, New York City scrambled to expand its hospital capacity. 
The Navy hospital ship traveled to New York to relieve the pressure on hospitals; the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was converted into a 4,000-bed medical center; and a field hospital was set up in Central Park.
The Central Park tent hospital, operated by Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian group run by the son of late televangelist Billy Graham, has since become the focus of online conspiracy theories.
""Thousands of babies and children are being brought up out of underground tunnels in New York's Central Park by military personal (sic), during the night and placed in tents brought in by Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse,"" one Facebook post says, in all capital letters.
The children, it adds, have been captive underground since birth, subjected to torture and ""kept as sex slaves.""
There is absolutely no evidence of this.
The field hospital
A 68-bed field hospital was set up in Central Park in April to help overwhelmed hospitals treat patients with COVID-19.
The hospital was made up of 14 tents used primarily for diagnosis, treatment and storage. When it first began operating, it had 10 ventilators and treated patients from Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York’s Queens and Brooklyn boroughs. 
Beginning April 1, an organization known as Samaritan’s Purse, working with Mount Sinai, treated nearly 200 coronavirus patients in the Central Park field hospital.

The facility operated until May 5, and ""all patients under Samaritan’s Purse care"" have since been discharged, according to its website.
Samaritan’s Purse said there is no truth to the claims about abused children being treated there. 
""These are totally false rumors,"" Kaitlyn Lahm, a Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson, said in a statement to PolitiFact. 
""We worked hand-in-hand with Mount Sinai Hospital to bring desperately needed surge capacity,"" she said. ""All patients treated at the Emergency Field Hospital were transferred from Mount Sinai to Samaritan’s Purse.""
News outlets including VICE and the Associated Press have investigated the origin of the claims and linked the conspiracies to the group QAnon and its followers. 
QAnon ""centers on the baseless belief that (President Donald) Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the ‘deep state’ and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals,"" according to AP reports.

A post claims, ""Thousands of babies and children are being brought up out of underground tunnels in New York's Central Park by military personal (sic), during the night and placed in tents brought in by Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse."" 
The Central Park hospital treated coronavirus patients. There is no evidence to support the claim that it housed abused children released from captivity. It appears the claim originated with the QAnon conspiracy group.

Tucker Carlson","Tucker Carlson falsely claims COVID-19 vaccines might not work




If Your Time is short





Clinical trials and real-world studies have shown the available COVID-19 vaccines to be effective at protecting against COVID-19 infections and severe symptoms.


Responding to Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s suggestion that the vaccines might not work, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the clinical trials showed “an overwhelming signal of efficacy.” 


The CDC still recommends that fully vaccinated people wear masks and keep their distance in public spaces. There are legitimate reasons for that, experts said, including the fact that many Americans have not yet been vaccinated.





See the sources for this fact-check




In a comment that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, rejected as a ""crazy conspiracy theory,"" Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested to his millions of viewers that the COVID-19 vaccines might not work.
Clinical trials and real-world studies have shown the available vaccines are effective at protecting against COVID-19 infections and severe symptoms, despite Carlson’s claim.
The Fox News host opened his April 13 segment by talking about the recent recommendation by federal regulatory agencies to pause use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, one of three vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. The agencies are investigating six reports of a rare but severe type of blood clot among the more than 6.8 million people who got the shot.
Carlson then turned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest public health guidance advising fully vaccinated Americans to continue taking precautions in public spaces.
""If the vaccine is effective, there is no reason for people who've received a vaccine to wear masks or avoid physical contact,"" he said. ""So maybe it doesn't work, and they're simply not telling you that. Well, you'd hate to think that, especially if you've gotten two shots. But what's the other potential explanation? We can't think of one.""

Carlson’s primetime show is among the most-watched cable news programs, and a video of his April 13 segment received nearly one million views on Facebook. 
The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Asked about Carlson’s comments, Fauci told CNN that they were ""certainly not helpful to the public health of this nation.""
""That’s just a typical crazy conspiracy theory,"" Fauci said. ""Why would we not tell people if it doesn't work? Look at the data. The data are overwhelming in the three vaccines that have been approved for use in an emergency use authorization, the J&J, the Pfizer, and the Moderna. You had 30,000, 44,000, and 40,000 people in the clinical trials, with an overwhelming signal of efficacy. So I don’t have any idea what he’s talking about.""

COVID-19 vaccines are effective
The proof that the vaccines work includes a lengthy regulatory process and vaccine trials that happened around the world. 
The Food and Drug Administration has authorized for emergency use two-dose vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, as well as a one single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. The three were approved after clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants.
As of April 15, nearly 126 million Americans had received at least one dose of a vaccine, and over 78 million have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have accounted for the vast majority of those inoculations.
Clinical trials showed the Pfizer vaccine to be 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections, compared with 94% for Moderna and 66% for Johnson & Johnson, according to the CDC. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was also found to be 85% protective against severe disease.
The clinical trials ""clearly show the efficacy of each vaccine,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.
Some fully vaccinated people can still get infected, since no vaccine is 100% effective. But the clinical studies show the vaccine can keep them from getting seriously ill, the CDC says.
""It is incontrovertible that the vaccines work,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Just look at hospitalization rates.""

The COVID-19 vaccines make people ""magnetized. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick.""












By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







Further studies have since supported the trial findings. A CDC study published March 29 found that under ""real-world conditions,"" the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective against infections two weeks after the second dose and 80% effective 14 days after the first dose.
A separate study conducted in Israel and published Feb. 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine provided nearly 90% protection.
""Israel is a good example of what high population-level vaccination rates can achieve,"" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University. ""Once they achieved high vaccination coverage, cases began to plummet.""
Explaining the guidance to continue wearing masks, social distancing
Carlson’s claim that ""maybe (the COVID-19 vaccine) doesn’t work"" hinged on the CDC’s latest guidance recommending that fully vaccinated Americans continue taking precautions in public.
Carlson said there are no good reasons for that. We found several, though.
The guidance reflects the fact that scientists are still learning about the vaccines: how long protection lasts; how much vaccines protect against emerging variants of the virus; and to what extent the vaccines prevent asymptomatic infections and transmission of the virus.
The CDC says preliminary evidence indicates that the vaccines ""may provide some protection"" against certain variants, and that ""a growing body of evidence"" suggests fully vaccinated people are less likely to be asymptomatic carriers of the virus and potentially less likely to pass it along to others. 
But the science on those questions is not settled, Watanabe said, and fears that newer variants could be more transmissible make additional safeguards important for now.
In public spaces, there is no way to tell who is among the roughly 25% of the U.S. population that has been fully vaccinated. Some ""very vulnerable people"" remain at risk, Nichols said. 
""Public health guidance on masks is not going to change until enough people are vaccinated because it is operationally very difficult to be able to tell who was vaccinated and who is not if you are, for example, working in a store,"" Adalja said.
Carlson past comments about the COVID-19 vaccines
Responding to Fauci’s criticism on his show April 14, Carlson claimed he had ""never for a minute doubted"" that the COVID-19 vaccines work, despite expressing that very doubt the night before, and saying there was no other plausible explanation for the CDC’s guidance
""Who is doubting that vaccines work? For the record, we never for a minute doubted it. We bought all of that stuff completely at face value. We believe in science,"" Carlson said, adding that he trusted the pharmaceutical companies behind the vaccines. ""The only reason we are asking the question is because the people in charge are acting like it doesn't work.""
A Fox News spokesperson cited those comments and other examples of Carlson claiming to support vaccines, including when he said he’s ""not against it on principle"" during his April 13 segment and when he said March 30, ""I think of myself as pretty pro-vaccine myself."" 
But Carlson has also questioned the vaccines and U.S. vaccination efforts before, just as he cast doubt previously on the effectiveness of masks and the threat of the coronavirus. 
On Feb. 9, Carlson said the government’s handling of the vaccines ""did not inspire confidence"" and that U.S. authorities were ""lying"" about their safety and effectiveness. On other occasions, he has suggested that the government is using the vaccines as a form of ""social control"" and that the shots would be made mandatory, which is not the case.
Many questions about the vaccines that Carlson has claimed authorities have ""discouraged"" Americans from asking have been answered by public health agencies and also by news outlets, including PolitiFact.
Our ruling
Carlson said, ""Maybe (the COVID-19 vaccine) doesn't work, and they're simply not telling you that.""
That claim is countered by clinical trials and real-world studies that show the available vaccines effectively protect against COVID-19 infections and severe symptoms. 
Carlson based his claim largely on the fact that the CDC still recommends that fully vaccinated people wear masks and keep their distance in public spaces. Carlson said he couldn’t think of a reason why the CDC would do that, but we found some pretty simple explanations.
Experts said those precautions are advisable because most of the U.S. population remains unprotected and because scientists are still studying to what extent the vaccines stop transmission, among other things.

Even as hospitals are limiting visitors, minors will always be allowed to have one guardian present.

There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and how long the pandemic will last, but parents across the U.S. can be certain that they will always be able to accompany their children to the hospital.
A recent Facebook post claimed that ""if your child gets this virus their (sic) going to hospital alone in a van with people they don’t know... to be with people they don’t know."" This run-on sentence ended with a soul-crushing statement: ""you will be at home without them in their time of need.""
Before any parents get too worried, this claim is entirely untrue because hospitals need parental consent to treat minors. Dr. John Gilliam explained in an interview with PolitiFact that ""minors can’t consent to treatment, legally."" Dr. Gilliam works in Oregon as a hospitalist, an in-patient physician who works exclusively in a hospital.

The University of Rochester Medical Center and the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital have both announced that recovering adults aren’t allowed any visitors, but children are still allowed to have one guardian accompany them.
If your child does have COVID-19 symptoms, the CDC first recommends to not take them to the hospital unless they develop emergency warning signs, such as having trouble breathing or experiencing persistent pain or pressure in the chest. The CDC has published guidelines for treating healthy adults and children with COVID-19 symptoms at home. The CDC also doesn’t consider children a high-risk group for COVID-19 and have found that children who have been confirmed to have the virus ""have generally presented with mild symptoms.""
