Susan Collins","In key US Senate race, Susan Collins’ attack on rival over COVID program partly correct




If Your Time is short





Susan Collins, the Republican incumbent in Maine, faces Democrat Sara Gideon in the Nov. 3 election, which could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate.


The law firm that employs Gideon’s husband received a Paycheck Protection Program loan of between $1 million and $2 million.


Gideon attacked Collins over the PPP; some of her points were accurate. Collins did write an exception in the law for hotels after receiving campaign donations from hotel political action committees.





See the sources for this fact-check




Susan Collins, viewed as among the most vulnerable U.S. senators up for reelection Nov. 3, says her opponent is guilty of hypocrisy in connection with the federal Payment Protection Program response to COVID-19.
The Maine Repubican’s challenger is Democrat Sara Gideon.
Gideon’s husband’s law firm ""took up to $2 million"" from the Paycheck Protection Program, a Collins ad claims, the same program she ""falsely"" attacked Collins over.
""That’s hypocrisy,"" the narrator says after making the two-part claim in the ad.
It’s similar to a Republican-on-Democrat attack we fact-checked in another key Senate race, in Arizona.
In this case, the $2 million part is correct, but the ""falsely attacked"" part is not.
Potentially pivotal race
Collins has been a senator since 1997. Gideon has served in Maine’s state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016.
Many news accounts say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats.
With polls showing a tight contest — the Cook Political Report has rated the race a tossup — federal aid programs for businesses have become a focal point of attacks on both sides.
How the PPP works
Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic avoid layoffs. The program was established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, signed into law in March by President Donald Trump.
The law provides for up to $659 billion in loans for businesses so they can pay their employees and cover certain other expenses, such as rent and utilities. The loans are forgiven if businesses meet specified terms.
While the federal government created and administers the program, banks, credit unions and other lending institutions handle the loan applications and disbursement of funds.
Collins’ ad
Collins’ ad launched on Facebook on Aug. 1. According to Facebook, it has been viewed 175,000 to 200,000 times.
Wayne Parry, who is identified as a Maine lobsterman in the ad, appears in and narrates the 30-second piece. As has been reported, Parry also served four terms as Republican state representative, backed by campaign donations from a Collins political action committee, and is currently running for his old seat.
The ad’s first claim is about a PPP loan of ""up to $2 million"" to the law firm of Gideon’s husband, personal-injury attorney Benjamin Gideon.

Berman & Simmons, a Lewiston law firm where Benjamin Gideon is a partner, received a PPP loan of between $1 million and $2 million, according to data from the Small Business Administration. The loan came from a Lewiston bank. The firm did not reply to our request for the exact amount of the loan it received.
Gideon campaign spokeswoman Maeve Coyle said Benjamin Gideon is one of 11 partners at the firm and was not involved in seeking the PPP money. She said 43 of the firm’s 61 employees are not attorneys, and that nearly all Maine law firms took PPP loans because the pandemic closed courts.
Most large Maine law firms sought PPP aid, the Associated Press reported.
""Falsely attacks Collins""
Collins’ ad says Gideon’s criticisms have included a false attack on Collins over the program. It cites a June 15 article by the Washington Post Fact Checker that called a Gideon attack ad ""highly misleading."" Still, there are some facts behind Gideon’s attack that are literally accurate, as new reporting from ProPublica shows. 
The Gideon ad claimed: ""As coronavirus spread, Susan Collins took $12,000 from the corporate hotel industry. Then Collins wrote a special loophole into her bill allowing large, out-of-state hotels to get millions — while only one in 10 Maine small businesses were getting the help they needed.""
We found that Collins collected a total of $12,500 in donations in February from hotel industry political actions. Her campaign committee received $2,500 from the International Franchise Association; $2,500 from Hilton Worldwide; and $2,500 from American Lodging and Hotel. And the American Lodging and Hotel PAC gave $5,000 to Collins’ leadership PAC.
As for the timing, by mid-February, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 15 coronavirus cases in the United States. Collins and other senators began drafting the PPP bill in early March, said her campaign spokesman, Kevin Kelley.
Collins was a key drafter of the PPP, which targeted aid to businesses with 500 or fewer employees. She did respond to lobbying from the hotel industry.
As reported Aug. 6 by ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit newsroom, Collins’ office said it had been contacted during the drafting process by the International Franchise Association and the American Hotel and Lodging Association, among other business interests, and ultimately an exception was written in the legislation for restaurant and hotel chains. Collins took credit for the exception, which allowed those companies to apply with up to 500 employees per location, even if they were much bigger overall.
At least 59 large hotel companies were approved for more than 600 forgivable government loans totaling up to $1 billion despite having more than 500 employees overall, according to ProPublica.
In an opinion article she authored, Collins called ProPublica ""a left-wing outlet that is financed by Democratic billionaires."" She defended the exception, saying it made a franchise hotel owner eligible ""as intended to help keep the business afloat and its workers employed,"" but that a large corporate chain such as Hilton ""is prohibited from receiving a PPP loan for its corporate headquarters or any hotels that it owns and operates directly.""
On Gideon’s claim that at the time, only one in 10 small businesses in Maine got the forgivable PPP loans, the Bangor Daily News reported that statistic as of mid-April, saying 16,000 Maine small businesses had received aid. That was at a point when the first batch of PPP funds had been exhausted.
Federal figures show that as of Aug. 8, more than 28,000 PPP loans were made in Maine. So, Gideon’s number was from initial reports that later increased. 
Overall, we found Gideon’s attack on Collins to be a mixture of exaggeration and accuracy. 
Our ruling
Collins claimed that Gideon’s husband’s law firm ""took up to $2 million"" from the same federal program she ""falsely"" attacked Susan Collins over.
The law firm where Gideon’s husband is a partner did take a loan through the federal Payment Protection Program program that could be as large as $2 million. With fewer than 500 employees, the firm qualifies as a small business under the program’s guidelines. But Gideon’s attack on Collins is largely accurate. 
As Gideon claimed in an ad, after Collins received campaign contributions from the hotel industry, she wrote an exception in the PPP law that, according to a ProPublica investigation, enabled at least 59 large hotel companies to be approved for more than 600 forgivable government loans totaling up to $1 billion.

U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready – even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly.
""In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we’ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,"" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania.
We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants.
Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize.
On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week’s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday – about 23,000 – was also well below last week’s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day.
These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home.
Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak’s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that ""we’re watching that data very closely.""
Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania’s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it’s time to reopen the economy in ""a gradual and safe way,"" Kelly said.

Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it’s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don’t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey and other Republicans are pushing for.
Hospital capacity will be tested again once social distancing ends, and a new Washington Post analysis shows that in many parts of the country, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, it won’t hold up.
A team of Post reporters analyzed the availability of critical care resources across the country using data sets assembled by Definitive Healthcare, an analytics company that mines government filings, including those of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as commercial insurance claims.
Imagining a scenario where the coronavirus infects two in 10 adults over the next year, the reporters found a patchwork of possible preparedness shortcomings in cities and towns where the full force of the virus has yet to hit and where people may not be following isolation and social distancing orders.
The Post determined that more than half of the nation’s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients. Parts of Pennsylvania that border Maryland and Ohio would fall especially short, the Post found.

Making the case to reopen the nation’s economy, Toomey said, ""In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we’ve reached the peak of the rate of infections.""
Data on coronavirus case counts and fatalities show that the country’s outbreak is subsiding. But Toomey’s comments don’t account for what will happen once social distancing ends.

If Your Time is short





Oscar Health does have ties to the Kushner family through Jared Kushner and more directly through Jared’s brother, Joshua Kushner.


Oscar Health created a website for finding coronavirus testing locations. The project was launched on the same day that Trump announced a similar partnership with Google.


There’s no proof that Oscar Health was specifically “tapped” by Trump to create its website.





See the sources for this fact-check




A health care startup linked to the family of Jared Kushner recently launched a website to help Americans assess their symptoms for the novel coronavirus and locate nearby testing centers.
The timing of Oscar Health’s testing locator coincided with President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a partnership with Google to build a similar website for the Bay Area.
Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that a rumor circulating on social media claims that Trump ""tapped"" his son-in-law’s company for a testing-related project.
""So Oscar Health, the company tapped by Trump to profit from COVID tests, is a Kushner company,"" the March 15 Facebook post says. ""Imagine that, profits over national safety.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The company does have a Kushner-family connection, and Jared Kushner has played a role in the White House’s coronavirus response efforts. But the Facebook post goes slightly too far in claiming that Trump ""tapped"" Oscar Health to profit from COVID-19 testing. 
What’s Jared Kushner’s connection to Oscar Health?
Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is connected to Oscar Health through his brother Joshua, a co-founder and investor in the health insurance start-up.
Mother Jones reported that a 2013 report from the New York State Department of Financial Services showed Jared Kushner was also a big player in Oscar early on.
The state report showed that, as of 2013, Oscar’s parent corporation was partly owned by Thrive Capital Partners III LP, which in turn was owned by Thrive Partners III GP LLC. The report listed both Jared and Joshua Kushner as owners of Thrive.
""Jared Kushner and Joshua Kushner are deemed the ultimate controlling persons in Oscar’s holding company system,"" the government report said.
Mother Jones also identified a 2018 New York State Department of Financial Services report, which said that as of December 2015, Joshua Kushner was ""the ultimate controlling person.""
Public financial disclosure forms for Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, show that the couple owned and received capital gains from shares of Thrive in 2017 and 2018 but divested from Thrive-associated funds in 2017. Their 2019 disclosures show no earnings from Thrive. 
Jared Kushner did seek advice from Joshua Kushner’s father-in-law, a physician, when helping to craft the White House’s coronavirus response, according to the New York Times.
Is Oscar Health making profits from COVID-19 tests?
It’s too soon to tell how much Oscar Health could profit off the coronavirus crisis. As an insurer, the company is not manufacturing or conducting tests, as far as we could tell. 
Oscar Health did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But we were able to complete Oscar’s risk assessment free of charge, and the page for locating testing centers said ""the cost of COVID-19 testing for Oscar members at any facility is $0.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







On March 18, Trump signed into law a relief package that makes coronavirus tests — and health care provider visits that result in the ordering of coronavirus tests — free for patients.
It’s possible that Oscar could still charge customers for health services associated with seeking a coronavirus test when a test isn’t ultimately produced, however.
Did Trump ""tap"" Oscar Health to help with testing?
We found no evidence that Trump formally tasked Oscar Health with helping to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, or that the company’s testing website was created at the White House’s request. (The White House declined to comment on the record.)
Business Insider reported that the company agreed to share the code it used to power its online portal for free with the HHS Department, which is building a similar website.
""Last week, the Oscar team built a COVID-19 risk assessment and testing center locator for our members,"" a spokeswoman for Oscar told Business Insider. ""The U.S government asked if we could share our code so that they could customize it for the website they are developing.""
HHS reached out to Oscar about the code on March 13, according to Business Insider. That’s the same day that Oscar rolled out its online portal in a press release. It’s also the same day that Trump announced a partnership with Google to build a similar website.
 
That timing likely fueled speculation on social media about an improper link between Oscar Health’s project and the White House’s broader testing efforts. 
As the Verge reported, a diagram that the White House displayed during a press briefing that day resembled the step-by-step description Oscar Health gave in its press release.

But in reference to the diagram shown at the March 13 White House press conference, a White House spokesperson told Mother Jones that ""Oscar had no involvement in this.""
HHS referred us to the White House without comment.
Our ruling
A Facebook post says: ""So Oscar Health, the company tapped by Trump to profit from covid tests, is a Kushner company. Imagine that, profits over national safety.""
The Kushner family is connected to Oscar Health, a health insurance company that recently launched a website to help locate nearby testing centers for the novel coronavirus.

Coronavirus







Rand Paul","In his continued sparring with Fauci, Sen. Paul oversimplified the science




If Your Time is short




The research Sen. Rand Paul cited shows neutralizing antibodies circulate in the body following Covid-19 illness or vaccination against the variant that emerged in the U.K.
But blood levels of antibodies are just one factor determining how people respond to virus exposure. Other factors, both biological and not, such as wearing masks, also play a role.
Broad conclusions cannot be drawn from the results of one study. The tweet oversimplified the findings, which did not assess other virus variants, such as the one that originated in South Africa.




See the sources for this fact-check




That Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky often disagrees with infectious-disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci is well known.
Recently, the pair clashed at a Senate hearing when Paul, a Republican, argued against mask recommendations for people who have had Covid-19 or have been vaccinated against it.
At the hearing, Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, pushed back against Paul’s characterization of wearing masks as ""theater."" Continued caution is advised, Fauci said, as scientists study the new variants now circulating in the U.S. and other countries.
Paul, an eye doctor by training, continued the squabble a few days later, calling out Fauci in a tweet, pointing to a study that he said ""shows vaccines and naturally acquired immunity DO effectively neutralize COVID variants.""
The tweet linked to a study published online at the JAMA Network, a family of specialty medical journals.
We reached out to Paul’s office for additional sources for his tweet but did not receive a reply.
So, we asked the experts: Are Covid variants effectively neutralized by vaccines or natural immunity conferred on people who recover from the illness?
In short, the research cited by Paul does show good blood levels of neutralizing antibodies against at least some of the current variants following infection or vaccination. But they’re not the whole story.
Mehul S. Suthar, an author of the study Paul cited, said the results are encouraging but should not be seen as all-encompassing: ""Our interpretation is that our study looks at one aspect of immune response, antibodies.""
Small samples. Big questions.
Neutralizing antibodies are important because they can block the ability of a virus like the one that causes Covid to infect cells. But the body also has other defenses. T cells, for example, can be spurred by infection or vaccination, Suthar said, although the study was not designed to look at those.
For the study, researchers gathered blood samples from 40 people who were in the hospital with Covid or had recovered from it. From the National Institutes of Health, they also received blood samples drawn from 14 people who had gotten both doses of the Moderna vaccine, said Suthar, an assistant professor at Emory University’s vaccine center.
Then they ran tests on those samples against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and three variants, including the one dubbed B.1.1.7, which first appeared in the United Kingdom and is now circulating widely in the U.S.
They wanted to know: Did antibodies produced by being infected or vaccinated neutralize B.1.1.7?
""We are lucky with B.1.1.7 that our antibodies appear to work well against this virus,"" Suthar said.
However, as with any study, there are caveats. For one thing, the results were based on a small number of samples. And the analysis did not include other variants of concern, such as the ones that emerged in South Africa and Brazil, which limits the ability to draw broad conclusions.
Finally, antibodies are just one measure of potential protection against disease. Laboratory research measuring antibodies indicates that some immunity is created by both illness and vaccination, but the strength and longevity of that protection — the effectiveness in the real world — is a separate question. That’s partly because the ideal level of neutralizing antibodies needed for protection is not known and other immune protections, such as T cells, aren’t measured.
Also, in the real world, other factors — such as the variant a person is exposed to, and the presence of  other mitigating factors, including masks and good ventilation — can make a difference.
""Part of the reason that real world data are so important is looking at the whole picture of immunity,"" said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Also, with the level of community transmissions of disease, I would be concerned that there will be more variants that emerge.""

By Victoria Knight • June 24, 2021







Nuance matters
Paul’s tweet — taking aim at what he sees as an overcautious approach by public health experts — doesn’t capture that type of nuance, nor does it reference studies on the other emerging variants.
""Blanket assertions made by non-scientific experts are not going to help,"" said Gronvall.
Dr. Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and a specialist in infectious diseases at Georgetown University, agreed.
""It’s wrong to declare victory and say there’s no problem with variants and that everyone previously infected will be fine,"" said Goodman, who served as chief scientist of the Food and Drug Administration under the Obama administration.
Viruses naturally mutate as they replicate. So it’s not surprising that the coronavirus has done so. Several variants have emerged, including home-grown ones from California and New York.
Lab tests on blood samples from vaccine trial participants in South Africa showed lower levels of neutralizing antibody production, possibly related to the variant circulating there.
How big a difference the lower levels measured in those samples make isn’t yet known.
Levels are still high and could ""effectively neutralize the virus,"" Fauci wrote in an editorial published Feb. 11 in JAMA.
Even so, clinical trials used to test Covid vaccines before they were approved for emergency use showed lower efficacy when tested in areas where the South African variant was circulating.
""We expect vaccines and prior infection to offer significant protection against variants that are closely related,"" said Goodman. ""But as they become more genetically different — like the South African one — that protection could go down.""
The main goal of the vaccines is to prevent hospitalization and death, and all the vaccines in use in the U.S. appear to substantially reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from Covid, according to research.
""Even if the current vaccines may not be perfect, they do appear to prevent more severe outcomes,"" Goodman said.
Don’t assume, as Paul’s tweet implies, that recovering from covid or getting vaccinated means zero risk of infection.
For one thing, reinfection is rare but can occur.
Goodman pointed to a recent study conducted in Denmark showing that a small percentage (0.65%) of people who tested positive for Covid in the spring fell ill again.
""People should not presume that even if they had the vaccine or were previously infected that there’s no future risk,"" Goodman said.
Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, Gronvall at Hopkins said not to use that as an excuse to avoid inoculation.
""The vaccines appear to be great,"" she said. ""Get one when you can.""
Our ruling
Paul is correct that the JAMA study showed vaccination or previous infection appeared, based on a small sample of people, to help neutralize the virus. However, he left out important details that make his position an oversimplification of a complicated issue.
The study considered only one variant — the one that emerged in the U.K. — and did not include an analysis of other types now circulating, or the potential for additional variants that could emerge. Also, the type of antibody studied is just one factor in protecting against disease, and just what those levels of neutralizing antibodies  measured in a laboratory experiment may mean in the real world is not known.

Among other measurements, the absolute number of coronavirus cases ranks far below the level seen in current hot-spot states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas. And the state’s positivity rate for test results is close to the low level that experts like to see.

In a thread of tweets posted July 10, the West Virginia Democratic Party blames Republican Gov. Jim Justice for the state’s jump in the rate of person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus. 
""Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state,"" the tweet begins.
The thread pointed to an announcement by Clay Marsh, the vice president and executive dean of West Virginia University Health Sciences, that the state was ranked No. 1 nationally in the rate of transmission.
""Today Dr. Clay Marsh announced that WV has the highest RT rate of any other state in the U.S.,"" the thread says. ""This means that WV is spreading COVID-19 from person to person faster than any other state in the country."" Bureau of Public Health commissioner Cathy Slemp, who resigned under pressure in late June, ""tried to warn Justice of this days before she was fired.""

Does West Virginia, the last state in the country to confirm a positive COVID-19 case, now top the country in the rate of transmission? It does, though the tweet lacks important context about the spread of the virus in the state and the country as a whole.  
Ranking states by Rt
The West Virginia Democratic Party did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we did reach Marsh to discuss the relationship between the rate of transmission and the growth in coronavirus cases.
He said scientists use two related but distinct measurements to study the spread infections such as COVID-19. One is R0, pronounced ""R-naught,"" and the other is known as Rt, or the effective reproduction number. Both measure how many people, on average, one infected person will infect. But they measure slightly different things.
R0 captures how fundamentally infectious a germ is when it’s introduced into a new population. By contrast, Rt measures how much the infection is spreading at a particular moment in time, taking into account factors such as the percentage of people who have already become infected and the preventive measures being taken against the infection.

""With both of these scores, any rate that is more than 1 suggests that the disease is spreading, and any rate below 1 suggests that it is reducing,"" Marsh told PolitiFact. 
On July 10, the day the Democratic Party’s tweet was posted, Marsh told WVMetroNews that the state’s Rt had increased from the nation’s second lowest rate two and a half months earlier to second-worst in the country. By that afternoon, CNN had posted an article citing Marsh and reporting that West Virginia had climbed to No. 1 nationally in Rt.
Marsh told PolitiFact that Rt is valuable for showing which direction the state’s level of infections could be heading in the following weeks. But other metrics are important as well, he said.
Marsh said he pays attention to the positivity rate -- the percentage of newly tested people whose results come back positive for the virus. The countries and states that have been most successful have kept this measurement below 3%, and West Virginia has toggled between 3% and 5% recently. (West Virginia is also one of only 11 states that are performing an adequate number of tests to control the spread, according to a New York Times analysis.)
Marsh said he also looks at the total change in the number of cases, using a 7-day or 14-day rolling average, and how close in-state hospitals are to their capacity for the number of ICU beds and ventilators
In other words, Rt gives researchers an idea about how fast the disease is spreading, but it’s not the only key to understanding the virus. Andy Shi and Xihong Lin from the Harvard Chan School of Public Health agree with Marsh’s assessment in an email interview with PolitiFact.
""Ultimately, what we are doing is we are trying to take a look at, ‘how do we measure today versus how did we measure a week ago, or two weeks ago, or a month ago,’ because that gives us a better idea about how our risk is changing,"" Marsh said.

Amy Klobuchar","Amid pandemic, polls show support for voting by mail




If Your Time is short





Sen. Amy Klobuchar cited a poll by a liberal group that found 78% support for voting by mail.


Other national polls show majority support for voting by mail, but not as high as the poll cited by Klobuchar.





See the sources for this fact-check




Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said that everyone should be able to vote by mail if they want to this year — and that the vast majority of the public agrees with her.
Klobuchar in March proposed a bill that gives states more money to handle increased mail-in voting and to make in-person voting sites safer amid a pandemic. She said that she doesn’t want to make everyone vote by mail, but that it is a safer option. The Republican-led Senate has not voted on the bill.
""The voters are with us, the people are with us,"" she said. ""80% of the people want this option and they want to have the polls open early."" (She made that statement in a conversation with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison April 24 and tweeted a portion May 16.)
We found that Klobuchar’s figure was close to one reported in a poll by a liberal group. Other national polls have found majority support for voting by mail, though not support levels as high as what Klobuchar cited.
""It is correct to conclude that a strong majority of voters support vote-by-mail options,"" said Janine Parry, University of Arkansas political science professor who was not involved in the poll.
Klobuchar noted that more than a dozen states require voters to give a reason for voting by mail. In some states, any qualified voter may vote by mail, while five states conduct all elections entirely by mail: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah.
While President Donald Trump and some GOP leaders have opposed efforts to expand voting by mail, concerns about the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is expected to increase demand for absentee ballots among people who fear exposure at in-person voting sites. Klobuchar’s bill, which was written with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has no GOP co-sponsors, but some Republican governors and election officials have advocated for more voting by mail, too.
RELATED: Does voting by mail lead to higher turnout in red, blue and purple states? It’s not that simple
Polls show support for voting by mail
Klobuchar’s spokesman said she was referring to a poll done for the liberal Brennan Center at New York University School of Law. The online poll of 1,550 Democrats, Republicans and independents in March asked respondents, ""Do you agree or disagree that: in the 2020 election, all states should be required to allow vote by mail or unexcused absentee ballots to ensure people can vote with ease and without being in long lines or crowds?""
In response, 78% said they agreed. Support was higher among Democrats (97%) and independents (79%) than Republicans (57%).
Polling experts noted that Brennan asked the question in a way that suggests positive reasons for voting by mail, which can lead to higher support among respondents.
The question was worded in a way that puts voting by mail in the current context of the pandemic, said Joel Benenson of the Benenson Strategy Group, which conducted the poll for Brennan. He argued that phrasing the question in a generic way doesn’t make sense because the current conversation is about changing policies this year for the pandemic, not permanently. 
The phrasing was different from the questions in a poll done for the Republican National Committee. That poll asked voters of both parties and independents for their views on ""mailing a ballot to all registered voters, including those who are inactive, meaning they have not voted in recent elections and not responded to an address verification mailing or have moved."" The results showed 53% opposed that idea. 
A separate question from that same RNC poll asked ""And, if your state changed current voting procedures to enact universal vote by mail, would you be concerned about the integrity of the election results and the ability for widespread fraud?"" Sixty-two percent answered yes. 
We asked the RNC why it didn’t ask a straight question about respondents’ views on voting by mail. Mandi Merritt, an RNC spokeswoman,  said that Democrats are suing states to make changes to voting by mail such as eliminating signature verification or sending ballots to inactive voters, so ""we felt it was important to gauge public opinion accordingly.""
""You can frame the question in ways that move the percentages up or down in support of mail in voting,"" said John G. Geer, co-director of the Vanderbilt poll (who wasn’t involved in these vote by mail polls).

By Tom Kertscher • June 1, 2021







National polls done in April by nonpartisan media outlets or research groups showed between 58% and 72% favoring voting by mail overall. That’s lower than the Brennan poll but still majority support. These polls also showed that support for voting by mail was higher among Democrats than Republicans, mirroring what the Brennan Center poll found. 


A Reuters/Ipsos poll found 72% of all U.S. adults supported a requirement for mail-in ballots for this year. The online poll surveyed 1,116 American adults.


Pew Research’s web poll of 4,917 U.S. adults found 70% favor allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to this year.


Gallup’s telephone poll asked 1,016 voters if they would ""favor or oppose your state allowing all voters to vote by mail or absentee ballot in this year's presidential election?"" Results showed that 64% favor their state allowing all voters to vote by mail or absentee ballot. 


AP/NORC found that if the pandemic lasts through November, 60% favor allowing voters to cast ballots by mail without a stated reason.


An NBC News/Wall Street Journal telephone poll of 900 registered voters found that 58% favored changing laws to allow everyone to vote by mail. For those who said they oppose changing laws, an additional 9% said they would support changing election laws for the November election amid the coronavirus.


Overall, surveys show support for voting by mail, but polling experts offered some important caveats. 
There is a difference between supporting vote by mail without an excuse and supporting efforts to automatically mail ballots — or even ballot applications — to all registered voters, said Barry Burden, University of Wisconsin political science professor, who was not involved in these polls. 
He noted that while the Pew survey found 70% favor allowing vote by mail, a smaller percentage — 52% — support conducting all elections by mail.
The polls could be measuring what pollsters call ""non-attitudes"" — meaning the respondents had not formed an opinion before being contacted by a pollster, said professor Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.
""It’s highly doubtful that many respondents had thought at all about voting by mail before they were interviewed, and the differences in wording of the questions shows how malleable opinions can be,"" he said. ""I’m concerned that these polls are creating public opinion rather than seeking to measure it!""
Health concerns fueled by the pandemic reinforces favorable thoughts about voting by mail, Geer said.
""Citizens, regardless of partisan stripe, favor more participation over less,"" he said. ""It is a general tendency and explains why voting by mail is popular.""
RELATED: How battleground states are preparing for the pandemic election’s massive increase in voting by mail
Our ruling
Klobuchar said ""80% of the people"" want the option of voting by mail.
Klobuchar was citing a poll done by the Brennan Center in late March which found 78% of respondents agreed that all states should be required to allow voting by mail to ensure people can vote with ease and while avoiding lines and crowds. 
Klobuchar has cherry-picked a poll by a liberal group that framed the question in a way that portrayed voting by mail as positive, and resulted in higher support than many other national polls.
The other national polls showed support between 58% and 72% for voting by mail.

Bryan Steil","GOP lawmaker only tells part of story in claim that Wisconsin spent 3.8% of federal coronavirus aid




If Your Time is short





Steil cited a report from the U.S. Department of Treasury, which said Wisconsin spent or transferred 3.8% of its CARES Act funds from March 1 to June 30.


But that figure doesn’t include expenses already incurred or funds already committed to programs and response efforts





See the sources for this fact-check




Wisconsin’s congressional delegation is embroiled in a debate over whether to send more aid to state and local governments squeezed by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in May passed the so-called HEROES Act, which would allocate nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments, among other provisions. However, Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump balked at that plan. The Senate has not passed its own version of a new COVID-relief bill, but White House officials are negotiating with Democrats in hopes of reaching an agreement on various issues.
In the midst of the debate, one Wisconsin Republican suggested Wisconsin may not need another round of federal funding.
""According to the Treasury Department, 3.8% of Wisconsin’s coronavirus funding has been spent,"" U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil tweeted on July 30, 2020. ""The rest is unaccounted for. I’ve asked Gov. (Tony) Evers to explain.""
Steil, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, hinged his argument on data from the U.S. Department of Treasury that points to the same figure. 
But the Treasury’s report is only part of the story.
Breaking down the numbers
Wisconsin received about $2.26 billion through the CARES Act to help the state manage costs stemming from the pandemic. Around $260 million of that went to Dane County, Milwaukee County and the city of Milwaukee, which were eligible for direct payments because their populations are over 500,000.
That left the state with roughly $2 billion. Evers can direct the spending. He does not need approval from the Legislature.
When asked for evidence to support Steil’s claim, a spokeswoman pointed to the report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which shows Wisconsin has spent or transferred around $75.6 million, or 3.8%, of its $2 billion in CARES Act funds. Recipients were required to report their spending to the department’s Office of Inspector General from March 1 to June 30.
On July 29, Steil wrote a letter to Evers seeking ""greater clarity on Wisconsin’s use of existing federal resources."" In the letter — but not the tweet — he notes that some funds have been spent while others were only obligated.

Emails show that Fauci knew ""hydroxychloroquine worked [and] emailed friends about it being effective.""












By Andy Nguyen • June 15, 2021







The letter cited a June 18 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which outlined $1.72 billion in COVID-19 initiatives that would be covered through the CARES Act. That leaves $280 million in federal dollars remaining.
Among the plans: $200 million in aid for local and tribal governments, $260 million for a COVID-19 testing program and $110 million to provide assistance to health care providers. Another $445 million was set aside for ""hospital and community preparedness"" in the event cases surge before the end of the year.
The state Department of Administration detailed those funding commitments in a July 17 letter to the U.S. Treasury Department. According to the letter, provided by Evers’ office, the documented amount does not include at least $67.2 million in costs incurred before June 30 that will be covered by federal funding.
Those funds will also cover $108.3 million already obligated for the state’s coronavirus response, the letter states.
""Because of the difference in timing between purchase orders, invoices, and payments, however, as well as the reimbursement model used for several of these programs, today’s interim report will capture only a portion (of) the reach of Wisconsin’s CRF funded commitments at the present moment,"" wrote Joanna Beilman-Dulin of the DOA. 
Translation: The spending reported by the U.S. Department of Treasury tracks just that — spending. It doesn’t include previous expenses or allocated relief funds, such as orders that have yet to be invoiced and grant programs with applications under review.
What’s more, Evers announced on July 27 — before Steil contacted the governor — that $41.6 million in federal funds had been distributed to farmers. That amount wasn’t included in the Treasury data because it was still under review when the state submitted its report.
That means the number Steil cited doesn’t show the complete picture. 
Our ruling
As Congress debates what the next federal relief package should look like, Steil claimed that ""3.8% of Wisconsin’s coronavirus funding has been spent.""
A report from the U.S. Department of Treasury said Wisconsin spent or transferred 3.8% of its CARES Act funds from March 1 to June 30. But that figure doesn’t account for expenses the state already incurred or funds it has committed to other programs and response efforts.

Donald Trump","Stock market record point rise followed record point drop




If Your Time is short



 


The Dow had a record-high point increase on the day Trump declared a national emergency in response to coronavirus, with the surge accelerating during his late-afternoon news conference.


But that followed a record point decrease the previous day. And it was followed by a sharp drop by the opening of the next trading day, which saw continued declines before closing.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump bragged that his March 13, 2020, statements about coronavirus had record-breaking influence on the stock market.
Wearing a baseball hat with ""USA"" emblazoned on the front, Trump told reporters gathered at the White House a day later on March 14, 2020:
""I was honored to see that the stock market — you were mostly there with us — set a record in a short period of time, over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden. That was a record; all-time record. I think we should do one of them every day, perhaps. How about five times a day? We’ll do one five times a day. But that was something to watch and — I had no idea. We walked back, I said, ‘So, how did that work out?’ They said, ‘Sir, you just set a new record in the history of the stock market.’ So, that was pretty good.""
The market did make a record surge on March 13, 2020, and the surge accelerated during Trump’s news conference that afternoon. 
But that record came a day after the steepest decline ever.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most popular measure of the stock market, gained 1,985 points on Friday, March 13. That was its biggest point gain ever, with the ""late-day surge"" coming ""while Trump was speaking,"" the Associated Press reported. The business and financial news network CNBC and other news organizations reported the same.
In his remarks, Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, announced greater availability of testing in the coming days and announced the purchase of oil for the strategic petroleum reserve — steps that may have helped lift the Dow.
His Rose Garden news conference started at 3:30 p.m. EDT and lasted an hour and 11 minutes, including remarks given by members of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force. At the start of the speech, the Dow was at 21,747.52. By the market’s close at 4 p.m., while Trump’s news conference was continuing, it was at 23,175.92, for a gain of 1,428 points over the course of the speech.
That gain itself was larger than the previous record for the largest point gain in a day — 1,293.96 points on March 2, 2020.
""Stocks rallied, shooting sharply upward in the last half-hour of trading as investors appeared to gain confidence that the Trump administration has a plan to combat the outbreak from both a health care and economic perspective,"" AP reported.

But that upward acceleration followed a record decline, as news organizations also reported.
As Barron’s put it: ""The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 10% on Thursday, marking its biggest one-day percentage (and point) drop since the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987.""
The rally ""only recovered most of the losses suffered a day earlier,"" MarketWatch reported, adding that the Dow is ""in a bear market.""
It’s also worth noting that those gains were fleeting. The increases of March 13 were wiped out by the next trading day, Monday, March 16, when the Dow dropped like a rock and opened 2,240 points down at 20,935.70 and then fell another 248 points by the market’s close. Such sharp rises and declines are common during times of stress in the economy.
""One good day was really more of a dead-cat bounce, as the market fell still further after that,"" Tulane University business professor Peter Ricchiuti told PolitiFact. ""Also, the stock market is not the economy. It’s a measure of projected corporate profits. Very different things.""
Kathleen Day, lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School and author of a book on financial crises, said in an interview: ""The big picture here is the stock market is gyrating. It’s unstable because of the virus itself and because of the lack of leadership (from Trump). The market wouldn’t have gone up so much if it hadn’t gone down so much.""
The White House didn’t respond to our requests for information.
Trump didn’t specify what type of record was set, but a point gain is one  legitimate measure. At the same time, large point gains and declines are natural when the Dow is at a high number. The index was marching toward 30,000 just a few weeks earlier. Stock watchers pay more attention to percentage changes on a given day or over time as a sign of the market’s strength. On that score, the gain for the day of Trump’s news conference was the largest percentage increase since October 2008.
Our ruling
Trump said that ""over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference"" on the coronavirus on March 13, 2020, the stock market set ""an all-time record.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its largest-ever point gain on March 13, with gains accelerating during Trump’s news conference. But that occurred one day after the Dow’s biggest point decline ever, and the gains were wiped out the next trading day.

Officials say the travel ban will remain in effect until it’s safe to lift, but have not given a specific date for its termination.





See the sources for this fact-check




The coronavirus pandemic has prompted temporary border closures around the globe. Is Australia closing its borders for six months, as some online posts suggest? It’s possible, but that hasn’t been determined.
""Australia Closing Borders in a few hours for 6-months,"" said the headline of a March 20 post on sydneynews.sydney, shared on Facebook.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The headline in sydneynews.sydney gives the impression that the 6-month time frame is a certainty. That’s not the case. Other news outlets, including the Guardian and Sky News, have posted more cautious headlines, saying the borders ""could be closed for six months.""
Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced March 19 that Australia would close its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents on March 20 at 9 p.m. Australian Eastern Daylight Time. (Exemptions apply for close immediate family members of Australian residents and citizens.)
The travel ban is part of a series of measures Australia is taking to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The government said that about 80% of coronavirus cases in Australia were people who caught the virus overseas or people in contact with individuals who returned from overseas.
The Australian government has said that the virus could be around for at least six months and that Australians should brace for disruptions in daily life. Whether the ban lasts six months is uncertain, as it’s exact duration has not been determined.
In media interviews, Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the travel ban would last as long as medical experts say it’s necessary, but that it was hard to put a precise date on when the ban would be lifted.
Here’s an exchange he had March 19 with Patricia Karvelas of ABC Radio National, according to a government transcript:
Karvelas: ""So just, again, level with us. Could this travel ban last for six months at least?""

An online post said, ""Australia Closing Borders in a few hours for 6-months.""
Officials have said the coronavirus outbreak and related disruptions in Australia could last at least six months. To slow the spread of the virus, Australia has banned entry to non-Australian residents and citizens and their immediate families. But it has not determined whether the travel ban will last six months.
Officials say it will remain in effect until it’s safe to lift, but have not given a specific date for its end date.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump embellishes details of Dr. Deborah Birx’s Thanksgiving weekend trip




If Your Time is short





The day after Thanksgiving, the head of the White House coronavirus task force Deborah Birx spent a couple of days with her daughter’s family at a vacation home in Delaware.


The sister of Birx’s son-in-law tipped off the Associated Press.


Birx announced she would retire a month later at the end of Trump’s term.





See the sources for this fact-check




Former President Donald Trump didn’t appreciate the comments Dr. Deborah Birx made in a CNN report criticizing his administration’s handling of the coronavirus. 
Birx, who was coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said the Trump administration failed to give the public clear, consistent guidance. She laid many deaths at the administration’s feet.
""There were about 100,000 deaths that came from that original surge,"" Birx said in the March 28 broadcast featuring several doctors who advised Trump. ""All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially.""
To date, the U.S. death toll is just shy of 550,000.
Trump fired back. In a statement, he cast Birx and infectious-disease chief Anthony Fauci, who also appeared on the program, as ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts."" He accused Birx of hypocrisy. 
""Who can forget when Dr. Birx gave a huge mandate to the people of our nation to not travel, and then traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving — only to have them call the police and turn her in,"" Trump wrote March 29. ""She then, embarrassingly for her, resigned.""
Birx did travel for Thanksgiving. Her family did not call the police. 
Here are the details.
Home for the holidays
On Dec. 20, 2020, the Associated Press reported that the day after Thanksgiving, Birx traveled from Washington to a vacation property on Fenwick Island in Delaware, just off Maryland’s Eastern Shore. The group included her husband; a daughter and her husband; and two grandchildren. The 130-mile drive takes about two hours.
The CDC Thanksgiving guidance recommended celebrating with ""people in your household,"" and said that ""staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others."" If you do travel, it said, ""always wear a mask in public settings and on public transportation.""

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







Birx’s trip lasted about two days. During that time, she appeared on CBS News’ ""Face the Nation,"" where she told young people who traveled for Thanksgiving, ""you need to assume that you're infected and not go near your grandparents and aunts and others without a mask. We're really asking families to even mask indoors if they chose to gather during Thanksgiving.""
When the AP asked Birx about the trip, she said through a statement from her office that she ""did not go to Delaware for the purpose of celebrating Thanksgiving."" It was more for winterizing her vacation home, the statement said, although the group did share a meal during their stay.
At a time when the public message was to stay home, the trip reflected badly on Birx as a public-health official. The AP article quoted two public health researchers who criticized Birx. Angela Rasmussen, a Georgetown virologist, said ""this disqualifies her from any future government health position.""
Two days after the AP article, Birx said in an interview that she planned to retire, saying her position ""has been very hard on my family,"" and that they had been dragged ""into this.""
In that interview, Birx said she welcomed the chance to help the incoming Biden administration take the reins in fighting the pandemic. Formally, Birx held the position of ambassador-at-large at the State Department, where she had served as global AIDS coordinator. She stepped down on Jan. 20, 2021, the last day of Trump’s term.
No police call
There is no report that anyone in Birx’s family called the police. We reached out to Trump’s office for their source and did not hear back.
The AP said the sister of Birx’s son-in-law brought the matter forward. Slate reported that the sister tipped off the AP and is estranged from the family. The AP said the woman acknowledged there was ""family friction.""
Our ruling
Trump said Birx ""traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving  — only to have them call the police and turn her in. She then … resigned.""
Birx took a two-hour drive with her daughter’s family to a vacation home the day after Thanksgiving. The sister of Birx’s son-in-law told the AP, not the police, about the trip. Birx soon announced she would retire, and she stepped down at the end of Trump’s term a month later.

Facebook posts","Are bottling limitations on liquid milk to blame for milk dumping?




If Your Time is short





A Facebook video focuses on bottling limitations for liquid milk to explain the need for milk dumping.


That is a factor, but so is the plunging demand for cheese, butter and other dairy products with restaurants shuttered.


And the types of dairy products needed have changed with people confined to their homes, which factories aren’t immediately able to adapt to.





See the sources for this fact-check




Soaring milk production and plummeting consumption have dealt a series of devastating blows to Wisconsin dairy farmers in recent years.
But the coronavirus pandemic has been a next-level gut-shot.
Shuttered schools and restaurants have cut off much of the demand for dairy, even as panicked shoppers bought out milk and other dairy products — and just about everything else in sight — as the quarantine began.
A heavily-viewed Facebook video painted the scene this way:
""Although grocery store dairy shelves remain sparse … dairy farmers are being forced to dump thousands of pounds of milk down the drain,"" says the two-minute clip from Courtenay DeHoff TV.
The clip goes on to say it’s not as simple as shifting production from school products to grocery store ones.
""Production lines are shuttering, and they’re scrambling to suddenly mass produce jugs when they are used to mass producing the little cardboard boxes handed out at schools.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Are farmers really dumping milk even as grocery stores are short of it? And are production limitations on liquid milk to blame?
We checked it out.
Supply chain effects from quarantine
Experts we spoke with said the factors cited in the video are accurate, but said a few other important elements are at play as well.
The quarantine has affected both the way liquid milk is consumed and the kind of processed dairy products needed. The Wall Street Journal said that has left dairy producers with at least 10% more milk than the industry can use.
Dennis Rodenbaugh, executive vice president at Dairy Farmers of America, the largest U.S. dairy cooperative, told the Wall Street Journal for an April 9, 2020, story that as much as 7% of the milk produced in the U.S. the prior week was dumped.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Patrick Geoghegan, executive vice president of industry relations for Dairy Farmers of Wisconsin, said the market swings have been enormous.
""Milk is being disposed of because of a massive and sudden loss of markets — more than half the nation’s restaurants are closed, sales of cheese are down 70 percent and some 44 percent of the nation’s cheese is sold through foodservice channels,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, citing the group’s industry research.
Some of the demand that remains is for products the industry isn’t set up to immediately produce. Shifting butter production, for example, from tiny packets for restaurants to large blocks for grocery stores can’t happen overnight.
But the use of liquid milk had changed dramatically as well — and that’s the element the Facebook video focused on.
Geoghegan said sales of fluid milk were up 55% for two consecutive weeks in March, though by early April it had fallen back to about 35% above norm.
As of early April, grocery stores are more consistently stocked, but there simply wasn’t the space or production to meet that initial demand in time.
""The shelf just doesn’t hold enough and they (couldn’t) restock often enough,"" said Doug Adams, president of Prime Consulting, which researches the dairy industry.
Dean Foods confirmed that their shift in production was in line with what the video described. They reduced production of paperboard milk cartons for schools by ""well over 50%"" after schools closed.
""As panic buying reached its peak, we shifted production to focus on products most in demand (whole and 2% milk for retail business) to maximize our output efficiency,"" said Anne Divjak, vice president of government relations & external communications. ""Demand has since normalized and we are back to normal production runs but still seeing significant declines in school milk and foodservice business.""
School milk does comprise about 7% of all liquid milk sales, Adams said. But much of that demand remains since school feeding programs remain active.
Geoghegan said there have even been intermittent shortages of school milk, since bottlers have diverted resources to meet grocery store demand.
Our ruling
A Facebook video focused on liquid milk said bottling limitations mean grocery stores are short on milk even as farmers are dumping it.
That is a factor, but it over-simplifies the situation a bit. Disappearing markets for cheese, butter and other dairy products in restaurants play a critical role in the suddenly changing dairy economy as well, experts say.
Milk is being dumped not just because it can’t be bottled in the proper way, but because the overall demand for all dairy products is down. And because the forms of butter and cheese needed have changed with people largely confined to their homes.

Donald Trump","Are coronavirus cases going down all over the US?




If Your Time is short



• Nationally, the data show a shrinking number of new daily infections and deaths. That downward pattern is also being mirrored in many states.
• However, some states are bucking that general pattern and seeing a rising number of new daily cases over time. This suggests a patchwork pattern where the coronavirus is accelerating in some places even as its spread is slowing overall.
• In the states that are seeing a rising number of new daily infections, the rise is not as rapid as it was earlier in the pandemic.



See the sources for this fact-check




As the number of coronavirus deaths neared 100,000, President Donald Trump struck an optimistic note about the state of the pandemic. 
""Cases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!"" Trump tweeted May 24.
Broadly, Trump has a point that the known spread of the virus has slowed in much of the United States. That said, the virus does continue to spread in some places, even if its rate of spread has declined from its level a few weeks ago.
Let’s start with the big picture.
Coronavirus deaths shot up quickly in March, peaked in April, and have been falling, though fairly slowly, in May. (The trend line in the following charts is jagged because the daily numbers for both measures tend to be smaller on the weekends before catching up early in the week.)

 
The same pattern can be found in data for the daily increases in positive coronavirus tests nationally:

 
In other words, the pandemic is easing, but not disappearing. The velocity of the spread is slowing, but it hasn’t stopped. The number of cases continues to grow.
And the national picture hides substantial variation within states.
""The U.S. is a patchwork of local epidemics right now, and looking at an overall national trend will mask sub-national trends,"" said Joshua Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Some places have seen significant declines in case numbers and shrinking epidemics. Some places have not yet seen significant numbers of cases at all. Still other places see ongoing transmission and, in certain locations, epidemics that are growing, albeit slowly.""
Let’s look at a few states where the daily number of new cases has declined steadily. Here is the data for New York and New Jersey. 

 
And New York and New Jersey aren’t the only states that have seen clear declines. Using the Kaiser Family Foundation’s data tracker, we found several other states that saw a distinct pattern of declining cases over time: Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. (You can see the patterns most clearly if you visit Kaiser’s data page, click on ""daily trends,"" and select ""seven-day rolling average change in cases"" for each of these states.)

By the same token, other states have seen distinct increases over time, something that undercuts Trump’s argument. For instance, here’s a chart showing the daily increase in cases in Alabama, North Carolina, and Virginia:

 
Using Kaiser’s data tracker, we found several other states that had a distinct pattern of rising cases over time: Arkansas, California, Maine, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
And if you drill down beyond the state level, there are localities where coronavirus continues to spread quickly. These ""hot spots"" include counties like Trousdale and Lake, Tenn.; Dakota and Colfax, Neb.; Lincoln, Ark.; Nobles, Minn.; and Ford, Kan., according to New York Times calculations. Often, hot spots have meatpacking plants or prisons where the coronavirus spreads easily.
Overall, death rates are declining in large cities and their suburbs, but have leveled off at a high level in medium-sized cities, small cities, towns, and rural areas, according to a data analysis by the Washington Post.
Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor in Boston University’s department of global health, noted that the sharp decline in cases in New York City has driven the decline nationally, and that separating out the rest of the country shows only a very small decrease:

 
Infection counts are subject to external factors, particularly the number of tests conducted. The more you test, the more infections you’ll find.
""Looking at case counts alone can be misleading if you want to know whether local epidemics are getting better,"" said Forrest W. Crawford, a Yale University biostatistician.
Still, data from the New York Times show that all states are making progress in at least one regard: a slower increase in infections than earlier in the epidemic. 
""The lockdowns and social distancing did work to slow growth, but not completely extinguish it,"" said Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University.
Ultimately, the data is varied enough that observers can choose to look at the glass as either half full or half empty.
""People who want to argue that things are getting better focus on slowing rates of growth,"" Crawford said, while those who argue that things are getting worse focus on declining case counts. 
Our ruling
Trump said, ""Cases, numbers and deaths (of COVID-19) are going down all over the Country!""
In general, the daily number of new infections and deaths is going down nationally, and in many states. However, a significant minority of states are seeing the number of new, daily infections rise, and some counties are ""hot spots"" with rapid spread.
This suggests a patchwork pattern with generally slower spread than earlier in the pandemic.

Rockefeller Institute, part of SUNY, found that over four years, 2015 to 2018, New York taxpayers paid $116 billion more in federal taxes than the state received in federal funding. During the same period, Kentucky received $148 billion in federal funds more than Kentuckians paid in federal taxes. 
Cuomo was right on the numbers, wrong on the timeframe. 




See the sources for this fact-check




Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently objected to the idea that the federal government would send money to help state and local governments dealing with high infection rates of Covid-19. The political affiliations of the elected leadership in these states, such as New York, California and Illinois did not go unnoticed by McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. ""Stop the Blue State Bailouts,"" read a news release from McConnell’s office. He suggested in a radio interview that these states declare bankruptcy instead.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, responded swiftly, calling McConnell’s bankruptcy suggestion ""one of the really dumb ideas of all time."" 
Cuomo then claimed that New York sends more money to the federal government than it gets in return, and that McConnell’s state regularly gets ""bailed out"" by the rest of the country. 
""He represents the state of Kentucky, okay?"" Cuomo said at a recent press briefing. ""When it comes to fairness, New York state puts much more money into the federal pot than it takes out. Okay? At the end of the year, we put into that federal pot $116 billion more than we take out. Okay? His state, the state of Kentucky, takes out $148 billion more than they put in."" 
""Senator McConnell, who’s getting bailed out here?"" he said later. ""It’s your state that is living on the money that we generate. Your state is getting bailed out. Not my state.""
We wondered if Kentucky gets $148 billion more from the federal government than it puts in, and if New York puts in $116 billion more than it takes out.
SUNY report
We approached Cuomo’s office, which said the governor was referencing an analysis from the Rockefeller Institute, published in January. The Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York, produced the report with support from Cuomo’s executive branch.
The report found that New Yorkers sent $116 billion more than they received in benefits over fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, while Kentucky received $148 billion more than it sent over the same period. In each of those years, New York led all other states in sending more money to the federal government than it receives, a measure also known as the ""balance of payments."" Meanwhile, 42 other states received more from the federal treasury in 2018 than they contributed, according to the report.
The Rockefeller Institute, using preliminary data, estimates that in the year ending on Sept. 30, 2018, New Yorkers sent $22 billion more to the federal government than they received, more than the amount sent by residents of the next two states that gave more than they got: New Jersey, with a deficit of $11.5 billion, and Massachusetts, with a deficit of $9.1 billion. When calculating the balance of payments on a per-person basis, New Yorkers paid $1,125 more than they received, more than all but three other states, according to the report.

“Cuomo opens New York 72 hours before his daughter's wedding.”












By Madison Czopek • June 17, 2021







A state’s balance of payments to the federal government can be affected by whether a state has military bases, defense contractors, or is home to a large population of federal workers, all of which require the federal government to spend money in that state. Also, the number of its residents that receive Social Security, Medicare, and welfare benefits, or whether a state is home to a lot of high-income households that pay more federal taxes, affects the balance of payments. In New York, the deficit between taxes paid and federal funds received is driven by high earners and businesses paying more in taxes, according to the Rockefeller Institute. 
New York’s independently elected comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, a Democrat, also tracks New York’s balance of payments. In January, DiNapoli found that in 2018 New York’s deficit was higher, and that Empire State taxpayers sent $26.6 billion more to Washington, D.C., than the state received in federal funds. Kentucky, meanwhile, received $29.9 billion more in federal funds than its taxpayers paid, DiNapoli found. The Comptroller’s Office analyzed New York’s balance of payments in federal fiscal year 2013, 2016, and 2017. The cumulative deficit in the balance of payments from 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018 was $111.5 billion, according to the comptroller.
""As in past years, the imbalance largely reflects New York’s comparatively high federal tax payments,"" DiNapoli wrote. ""The State generated nearly $254 billion, 8% of the $3.2 trillion in federal tax receipts. By contrast, the $227 billion in federal spending the State received represented 6% of the nationwide total, virtually the same as New York’s share of the U.S. population.""
The late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who served from 1977 to 2001, brought attention to this imbalance of payments in a report he issued annually, known as ""the fisc."" In his 1985 report, for example, Moynihan found that New Yorkers had paid $2.1 billion more than the state received in federal funds during the previous year.  
PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim in 2018, specifically that New York is a ""donor state,"" and found it to be True. Our reporting then showed that in a system of progressive taxes, where wealthier people pay more, and that money is redistributed to people in need, it’s not unusual that states with wealthy residents give more than they get.
Our ruling
Cuomo said that ""at the end of the year,"" New York puts $116 billion more into the federal treasury than the state receives in federal funds, while Kentucky receives $148 billion more than it contributes.
Cuomo was referencing figures from a report from the Rockefeller Institute, which has been widely cited.
However, a listener to Cuomo’s news conference would likely think that these figures represent yearly contributions. They are actually four-year cumulative totals contained in the Rockefeller Institute analysis.

If Your Time is short



 


Graham, who wants to see America reopen quickly,  claims the COVID-19 infection rate in Sweden, which has no forced shutdown, is lower than in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.


Sweden’s known infection rate is lower. But the epidemiologist credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy said infection rate is not a reliable indicator of how a country is doing.





See the sources for this fact-check




While cheering President Donald Trump’s ideas for ""opening up America"" amid COVID-19, the Rev. Franklin Graham suggested on Facebook that Trump’s ""enemies and the liberal media"" want a prolonged national shutdown in order to prevent Trump from being re-elected.
The Christian minister and son of Billy Graham, the late evangelist, also made a claim about Sweden and its contrarian approach to combating the coronavirus. ""I read yesterday that Sweden had not shut down, but their people were following social distancing and other protocols with the government stressing personal responsibility, and their infection rate still remains lower than the UK’s, Italy’s and Spain’s,"" Graham wrote in an April 17 post on Facebook. 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) After PolitiFact published a rating on this statement April 24, Graham edited his original Facebook post to remove reference to the infection rate.

Data support Graham’s claim about infection rates. But the epidemiologist credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy said infection rate is not a reliable indicator of how a country is doing. 
Sweden goes voluntary, not mandatory
Sweden has a population of 10 million people, nearly nine out of 10 of whom live in urban areas; about 20% of residents were born abroad.
In contrast to most of the United States, Sweden has imposed no lockdown and no quarantines, although groups of larger than 50 people are banned. With elementary schools, bars, restaurants and businesses still open, though with social distancing and other safety measures encouraged, what’s happening in Sweden seems like something closer to life as most Americans remember it.
The idea in Sweden is to essentially pursue herd immunity — let the virus spread as slowly as possible while sheltering the elderly and the vulnerable until much of the population becomes naturally immune or a vaccine becomes available.
The infection rates
We didn’t get replies when we asked for information from two North Carolina-based organizations led by Graham, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the international relief organization Samaritan's Purse.
We found infection-rate figures from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, who is director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford. 
Here are the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1 million people as of April 17, the day of Graham’s post:
Spain: 3,910.1
Italy: 2,794.18
United States: 2,028.17
United Kingdom: 1,518.62
Sweden: 1,241.67
So, Sweden’s known rate of infections is lower than the other countries Graham mentioned (and lower than the U.S. rate, as well).

We’ll note that Our World in Data figures for April 17 show that the death rate — the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases — in Sweden was slightly higher than Spain’s, though lower than the other countries Graham cites. 
United Kingdom: 13.32%
Italy: 13.12%
Sweden: 10.63%
Spain: 10.46%
United States: 4.96%
Sweden’s death rate was much higher, however, than the three countries that border it: Denmark: 4.67%; Finland: 2.23%; Norway: 2%.
Use caution on infection rates
Experts urge caution on reading too much into the infection-rate figures that Graham alludes to.
Testing has been focused on health care workers and people whose cases who are serious enough to end up in the hospital, so we don’t know the number of people infected who suffer mild or no symptoms, wrote Paul Franks, a genetic epidemiology professor at Lund University in Sweden and an adjunct professor at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health.
""The existing data suggest that the infection rates are probably much higher in Stockholm than in London and a little higher across Sweden than across the UK,"" he told PolitiFact.
Indeed, Anders Tegnell, the epidemiologist who is credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy, says infection rate is not a good measure of how a country is doing.
""The recorded infection rate depends hugely on the number of tests performed and what indications for testing that are used,"" Tegnell, the director of the Swedish Public Health Agency, told PolitiFact. ""In other words, an unreliable measure.""
Asked if Sweden’s strategy has been effective, Tegnell told us: ""Partly, to the extent that the health system managed the challenge and that there are always free beds. Not so well in protecting the elderly.""
A surge in Sweden
As we were preparing this fact-check, there were reports that confirmed infections in Sweden were rising sharply. For example, according to The Guardian, Sweden reported 812 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on April 24, the highest number of new cases in the country yet reported.
At the same time, if Swedish studies are accurate, infections and deaths in Stockholm, where more than half of the country’s COVID-19 deaths have occurred, should ""drop substantially in the coming weeks,"" Franks wrote on April 23. 
Our ruling
Urging that the reopening of the United States not be delayed, Graham said the COVID-19 infection rate in Sweden, which has no forced lockdown, is lower than in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.
Infection rates are lower, but that’s not necessarily a telling metric. Experts, including the epidemiologist credited with devising Sweden’s no-lockdown strategy, said there are other reasons, including a lack of testing, not to read too much into infection rates as a measure of how well a country is responding to the virus. Sweden’s death rates, for example, are higher than some of its peers. 
For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True.

AFL-CIO","Widespread Facebook post blames 2006 law for US Postal Service’s financial woes




If Your Time is short





The Postal Service has experienced years of financial troubles. Last-mile delivery services it provides for Amazon are not the cause of those problems.


The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act required the Postal Service to pre-fund future retiree health benefits, not pensions. The law put a financial strain on the service, which has defaulted on some of the statutorily prescribed payments.


The Postal Service has more financial problems than just the requirements of that law.





See the sources for this fact-check




As Washington scrambled to prop up businesses stung by the impact of COVID-19, President Donald Trump reportedly threatened to reject a version of the recently-signed stimulus package that contained funding for the U.S. Postal Service.
According to the Washington Post, Trump would have blocked the CARES Act had it included a $13 billion grant for the Postal Service instead of the $10 billion loan from the final version.

Trump has long been critical of the Postal Service, saying as recently as April 7 that the service ""has lost billions of dollars every year"" and has an unfair relationship with Amazon. 
But a widespread Facebook post says Trump’s frustrations are misguided, and that members of his own party are actually to blame for the Postal Service’s financial problems.
""The Postal Service is not losing money because of Amazon,"" the post says. ""It’s losing money because in 2006, the Republican-led Congress passed a law forcing it to prepay its pensions for 75 years, which no other corporation does. This was meant to bankrupt it so it’s business could be privatized for profit. Without this law, the Postal Service would be turning a profit.""
The post has been around more than a year, but it was picked up April 13 by the AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
In this case, the post is accurate in some ways, and misleading in others. Kalina Newman, a spokesperson for the AFL-CIO, cited a 2010 Postal Service report and a CNBC article.
A lame-duck Republican Congress did pass a financially burdensome law in 2006 requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees, and the service’s deal with Amazon hasn’t proven to be the money drain that Trump has said it is. But the service has more financial problems than just the requirements of the 2006 law.
We won’t weigh in on whether the law was ""meant to bankrupt"" the Postal Service.
Background on the Postal Service
The Postal Service is a unique agency. It's meant to be self-sustaining, paying for itself from the money it makes off postage and other daily mail services. 
But it also has to follow rules set by Congress that result in higher costs — notably, it’s expected to deliver mail daily and keep postage rates flat for all parts of the country.
The rise of the internet tanked the volume of first-class mail in circulation, which peaked in 2001 and has dropped every year since. Costs, on the other hand, haven’t gone down. 
The coronavirus has sent those problems spiraling out of control. Mail volumes have declined and sales are ""plummeting,"" Postmaster General Megan Brennan said in a recent statement.

A U.S. Postal worker makes a delivery with gloves and a mask in Warren, Michigan, on April 2, 2020. (AP/Sancya)
""We now estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the Postal Service’s net operating loss by more than $22 billion dollars over the next 18 months, and by over $54 billion dollars over the longer term,"" Brennan said.
Amazon has been a bright spot
While the Postal Service has seen declines in first-class and marketing mail, growth in shipping and packaging — which includes Amazon — has been a bright spot. 
In 2019, the Postal Service reported a net loss of $8.8 billion, but the shipping and packages segment of its business increased revenue by $1.3 billion, or 6.1%, over 2018.
Amazon and other bulk suppliers do get a special rate, as the Postal Service provides discounts to companies for which it does last-mile delivery. But it’s at least a break-even venture. 
That’s because the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act — the law responsible for the retiree health benefit requirement — made it illegal for the Postal Service to price parcel delivery below its cost. One study said the Postal Service could be charging more, however.

The health benefit requirement
The 2006 law also established a fund for Postal Service retiree health benefits. It required prepayment of those benefits according to a 50-year schedule, starting with 10 years of statutorily prescribed payments of roughly $5 billion from 2007 to 2017. 
Previously, the service funded the benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis.
The act was passed by a Republican-led Congress. But it dealt with retiree health benefits, not pensions, said David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service.
There’s also some confusion over whether the Postal Service was forced to prepay benefits ""for 75 years,"" as the Facebook post said. The language of the law doesn’t mention 75 years, and Partenheimer said the Postal Service has not used that timeframe to describe the requirement.
In 2012, the Government Accountability Office said the act ""did not require USPS to prefund 75 years of retiree health benefits over a 10-year period"" but that the ""payments would be projected to fund the liability over a period in excess of 50 years, from 2007 through 2056 and beyond.""
Regardless, Partenheimer told us that ""the pre-funding requirement included in the 2006 law is a major reason for our financial situation, along with an outdated business model.""
The Postal Service began defaulting on its payments in 2012. A fact sheet said that without defaulting, the service ""would not have been able to pay our employees, our suppliers, or deliver the mail"" — a point the postmaster general reiterated in 2019 congressional testimony.
James O’Rourke, a teaching professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, said the Facebook post is ""more-or-less correct"" about the 2006 law.
""This advance funding requirement places a burden of about $6.6 billion on the postal service that would not exist if they followed a pay-as-you-go approach,"" O’Rourke said. ""This burden has quite nearly bankrupted the USPS over a 15-year period.""
But Jim Campbell, a private attorney and an expert on postal service laws, said the 2006 law also freed the Postal Service of a prior obligation to cover pension costs for military service its employees completed before joining the Postal Service. 
A 2009 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that shift relieved the Postal Service of a $27 billion cost. Campbell said that when the 2006 law was enacted, it was expected that relief from prior costs would ""more or less completely offset the new obligation.""
Still, no other federal agency faces a similar pre-funding mandate, O’Rourke said. Private companies that do pre-fund their future retirees’ health benefits don’t usually cover 100% of those costs in advance, a 2015 CRS report said.
Would the Postal Service be turning a profit otherwise?
The Facebook post suggests that if the Postal Service could get rid of the 2006 law, everything else would be fine. But the reality is more bleak — especially now.
""The problem with the Postal Service is just much more fundamental than this,"" Campbell said.
It does appear that the law’s elimination would have brought some relief. The progressive Institute for Policy Studies wrote that ""if the costs of this retiree health care mandate were removed from the USPS financial statements,"" the Postal Service would’ve reported operating profits from 2013 through 2018. That’s accurate, according to a chart from the Trump administration’s 2018 report on the Postal Service.
In congressional testimony last year, Postal Service board member David Williams said the pre-funding requirement has been ""devastating"" not only because it limited other spending, but also because it ""wiped out our entire ability to make capital investments"" to modernize.
Still, as we noted in 2011, the Postal Service’s problems are greater than the retirement rules. 
The service’s own fact sheet says a House bill to scrap the pre-funding requirement ""will not reduce our underlying liability for retiree health benefits, nor improve our cash flow or long-term financial position."" COVID-19 has worsened that position further in recent weeks.
""The USPS is forecast to lose tens of billions of dollars over the next decade,"" the Trump administration’s 2018 report said. ""Standalone proposals, such as forgiving the prefunding of post-employment benefits or renegotiating labor contracts, will be insufficient.""
""If left unattended, closure of the U.S. Postal Service in the years just ahead remains a possibility,"" O’Rourke added.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said: ""The Postal Service is not losing money because of Amazon. It’s losing money because in 2006, the Republican-led Congress passed a law forcing it to prepay its pensions for 75 years, which no other corporation does … Without this law, the Postal Service would be turning a profit.""
The Postal Service isn’t losing money from its deal with Amazon. But the 2006 law requiring the pre-funding of health benefits for future retirees — not pensions — has put a financial strain on the Postal Service and hurt its ability to turn a profit in some recent years. 
However, the Postal Service has more financial problems than just the requirements of the law.

Marco Rubio","Rubio takes Democratic school reopening vote out of context




If Your Time is short





Schools would get funds under the American Rescue Plan Act regardless of whether they have fully reopened.


A mix of factors drive school reopening decisions, such as the needs of students and local infection rates, and schools occasionally change course depending on circumstances. 


The COVID relief bill funds a wide range of school actions, from immediate steps to prevent viral spread to remedial education to longer term building ventilation upgrades.





See the sources for this fact-check




The path toward bringing students back to real classrooms with teachers and desks and art in the hallways has taken many twists and turns. The Democrats’ massive COVID-19 relief bill has $125 billion to help schools bring their students back and make up for a troubled year.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had an amendment that would tie aid to how fully reopened a school was. When his amendment failed on a mostly party-line vote, Rubio tweeted his disdain.
""Tonight, Democrats voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen,"" he wrote March 6.
 
Let’s unpack that.
Rubio’s proposal
The relief package provided money for a variety of purposes, including summer remedial education, student counseling, rebuilding ventilation systems and taking any steps needed to slow the spread of the virus.
Rubio’s amendment would have tweaked the distribution formula for those billions in school aid. Under his proposal, every school district could count on getting 25% of whatever amount would be its share. (That share would be tied to the federal Title I funds the district normally received.)
Beyond that 25%, ""for each school day in a five-day school week"" that district schools were open to 100% of their students, the district would get an additional 15% of its money. 
""This amendment incentivizes us to get our kids back in school,"" Rubio said March 6 on the Senate floor. And he targeted one group that he felt stands in the way. 
""We do have unions — and to be fair, not all — but we do have unions that say, ‘We're not going back until next year,’ even if all the (safety) measures are put in place,"" Rubio said.
The limits to Rubio’s complaint
Rubio chastised Democrats for voting to send reopening money to schools that refuse to open. But his criticism contains some misleading elements.
Rubio’s term ""refuse to reopen"" casts schools as adopting a policy simply as a matter of preference. But many factors drive school closures. 
Education researchers who have pulled together data on schools and the coronavirus found that schools that choose to reopen don’t necessarily stay open.
The Center for Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington has been tracking 477 school districts. Many of them began to bring students back at the start of the school year, but then reversed course. Between November and December, remote learning increased, by 7% in suburban communities and 20% in urban areas.

By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







""Several districts shifted toward more opening through the fall but seemed to pull back on these partial reopenings as the winter surge took hold,"" said center associate director Betheny Gross.  
Tactical shifts in response to the virus make it difficult to define schools as ones that ""refuse to reopen."" 
Gross said the great majority of schools seem to aim to reopen at least partially. Only about 7% relied solely on remote teaching for all grades in October, November and December.
Rubio’s claim also simplifies the nature of the bill’s school aid. The $125 billion is aimed at much more than just reopening schools. With an eye on remedial teaching, it orders districts to reserve 20% of their funds for measures such as summer school, after-school tutoring and an extended school year. The school aid spans many years to sustain efforts to help students make up lost ground.
We reached out to Rubio’s office and did not hear back.
The Democratic school reopening policy
Rubio’s comment suggests that returning kids to school is a low priority among Democrats.
In January, President Joe Biden released a pandemic strategy plan that said the country is ""committed to ensuring that students and educators are able to resume safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible, with the goal of getting a majority of K-8 schools safely open in 100 days."" 
The following month, a reporter asked press secretary Jen Psaki to elaborate on Biden’s goal of reopening schools. 
""His goal that he set is to have the majority of schools — so, more than 50% — open by day 100 of his presidency,"" she said Feb. 9. ""And that means some teaching in classrooms. So, at least one day a week. Hopefully, it’s more. And obviously it is as much as is safe in each school and local district."" 
A week later, at a CNN town hall, Biden said ""the goal will be five days a week,"" and he thought that for grades K-8, the country would ""be close"" to seeing a majority of schools fully reopened. High schools, with the greater chances of viral spread, might be more challenging, Biden said.
Our ruling
Rubio said that ""Democrats voted to send reopening money to schools that refuse to reopen.""
Democrats voted down a Rubio amendment that would have tied the school aid amounts to whether school buildings were open to students.
But education experts said it is not accurate to define closed or partly closed school buildings as ones that ""refuse to reopen."" Some schools that brought some students back backtracked in response to surging infections in the community. 
Also, Rubio described the Democratic vote as being narrowly about reopening. They voted for money to help more schools reopen, to make changes to stay open and to provide remedial instruction to make up for lost ground.

The document was swiftly denounced by top health officials and thousands of researchers and scientists around the world, who called the approach unethical and nearly impossible.

""The world renowned experts in their fields, after a 4 day conference regarding COVID-19, declare that WE SHOULD ALL GO BACK TO LIVING NORMALLY, PRACTICING SIMPLE HYGIENE & STAYING HOME WHEN SICK (NO FACE MASKS OR SOCIAL DISTANCING) and only protect the most vulnerable populations with more protective measures!""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The social media post doesn’t provide the full picture. It’s accurate that three scientists authored a letter that endorses herd immunity and supports a completely reopened society for those with no underlying health conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its publication in early October, however, the document has been widely criticized by scientists and denounced by top health officials and thousands of doctors around the world. 
The Great Barrington Declaration
The document was drawn up following a meeting hosted by the libertarian think-tank American Institute for Economic Research. Named the ""Great Barrington Declaration"" after the Massachusetts town in which it was drafted, the paper was signed by scientists and health experts across the world. But a British broadcast station found that some of those who signed the letter online used fake names, including ""Dr. Person Fakename"" and ""Dr. Johnny Bananas."" The signatures were later made private.
The plan was put together by three scientists from prestigious universities: Dr. Sunetra Gupta of Oxford University, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, and Martin Kulldorff of Harvard University.
But none in the group have published any peer-reviewed studies about the coronavirus, and some have advocated for herd immunity over lockdowns for months, telling policymakers that the virus isn’t that deadly.
The plan, which they describe as ""focused protection,"" calls for only protecting ""vulnerable"" people and for otherwise healthy people to live life as normal, as if the virus doesn’t exist, thus opening up the avenue for them to get infected with COVID-19. It reads, in part: 
""The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk...
""Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The controversial idea falls in line with the Trump administration’s position on reopening the United States during the pandemic, and the authors discussed the strategy in a meeting with Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Scott Atlas, a Stanford neuroradiologist on the White House coronavirus task force, Buzzfeed News reported. White House officials also embraced the paper.
Health officials respond
The document was quickly and emphatically rejected by the greater scientific and medical community, including top U.S. health officials, the World Health Organization and the United Kingdom government.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the declaration ""ridiculous"" and ""total nonsense"" in an interview with ABC News: ""If you talk to anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious disease they will tell you that that is risky, and you will wind up with many more infections of vulnerable people, which will lead to hospitalizations and deaths. So I think we just gotta look that square in the eye and say it’s nonsense.""
""Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic. It is scientifically and ethically problematic,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference on Oct. 12.
Matt Hancock, the UK’s health secretary, attacked the document in Parliament on Oct. 13, saying that many infectious diseases never reach herd immunity, and called it a flawed goal without a vaccine. Hancock also took issue with the paper’s idea of separating the elderly and vulnerable.
""That is simply not possible,"" Hancok said. ""As the medical director of the NHS said yesterday, we cannot somehow fence off the elderly and the vulnerable from risk while everyone else returns to normal. It is neither conscionable nor practicable — not when so many people live in intergenerational homes, not when older people need carers who of course themselves live in the community, and not when young people can suffer the debilitating impact of long COVID. ...If we let this virus continue unchecked, the loss of life would be simply too great to contemplate."" 
Thousands of other experts have also spoken out against the declaration. 
A counter-memo, first published in the Lancet medical journal and signed by a group of 80 researchers, called the idea ""a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence."" More than 6,400 scientists, researchers and healthcare professionals have since signed the memo.
Our ruling
A Facebook post says ""world renowned experts in their fields"" have determined that the vulnerable should still be protected amid COVID-19, but those without underlying medical conditions should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.
Three scientists authored a declaration that calls for what they termed ""focused protection"" — shielding the vulnerable while otherwise healthy people to return to schools, offices and restaurants.
Readers who see the social media post and nothing else will be left with the wrong impression about the safety of such a plan. It was immediately denounced by top health officials and thousands of doctors and scientists around the world, who say that the plan is dangerous and nearly impossible to execute in a world where vulnerable populations cannot ethically live in isolation.

We couldn’t find a supporting number. But we did learn that it’s normal for NC hospitals to treat patients while their facilities are close to being full.
Accustomed to high capacity
We reached out to Jackson about his tweet. He said he heard the figure from officials with North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services. So we reached out to them.
DHHS spokeswoman SarahLewis Peel responded by email, but didn’t give an exact number.
""On any given day, our hospitals — by design — operate at 90 to 100% capacity. That’s why we have sought waivers to allow critical access hospitals to operate above their licensed capacity,"" Peel wrote.
DHHS later clarified that those numbers are usually during flu season and that evidence is anecdotal. It’s from speaking with hospital managers and suppliers.
David Weber, the associate chief medical officer at UNC Health, told NC Health News something similar. He said that, with the closure and downsizing of many rural hospitals, there are fewer beds overall across the state.
""The U.S., compared to years ago, has less open beds and on a normal busy week, you know, most of our hospitals, including UNC, would be running between 90 and 100% occupancy,"" he said.
However, we need hard numbers -- not anecdotes -- to get the most accurate picture.  
Other estimates
So, what stats are available? The North Carolina Health Association had a lower estimate, but its latest figures are from 2018.

Cynthia Charles, the association’s vice president for communications, pointed to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, the average US hospital occupancy rate was 65.5 percent.
""For North Carolina, (the) average hospital occupancy rate is 61% for 2018,"" she said.
Other estimates PolitiFact found put the average occupancy rate in the 60-to-75 percent range.
Charles noted that people may get different estimates depending on how they account for beds, among other things.
""There could be a difference in how they’re defining capacity, for example whether they are looking at licensed vs. staffed beds, or whether they are considering ‘current state’ staffing as capacity,"" she said.
Bigger hospitals, fuller spaces
Mark Holmes, director of UNC’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, agreed with Charles. Holmes said there are different ways to count beds and averages. Staffing levels could also come into play, he said.
Holmes and his colleagues recently analyzed cost reports filed to Medicare in 2018. Those numbers suggested a 58% occupancy average, he said. It’s likely that some small, rural hospitals bring down the statewide average.
""Some of our smaller hospitals are at less than 20%,"" he said. ""But larger ones — like Duke and UNC— are indeed at 85% on average throughout the year.""
The Sheps Center recently published a study of NC hospital occupancy rates.
Important final point: hospital capacity should not be viewed as the sole indicator of whether it can continue treating patients, Holmes said.
Hospitals need four things to properly treat patients, he said:

square feet 
a license from the government
equipment (including beds), and 
qualified staff.  

Hospitals may face limits in terms of square footage, Holmes said. But some government agencies are relaxing those regulations and hospitals are creating space where they can, such as dormitories.
Indeed, Weber said UNC Health is shifting its units around and even using tents outside to triage and treat people with ailments that aren’t as serious as COVID-19.
""So the square feet and licenses are less important than, in general, the attention they often receive,"" Holmes said in an email. ""Most people who study this issue think the biggest limitations to capacity are equipment— e.g. ventilators — and qualified staff, especially as the epidemic infects staff and their family members.""
Our ruling
Jackson said North Carolina’s hospital beds ""are typically 85% full across the state.""
The way he worded his tweet makes it seems like all hospitals are usually at 85% capacity. That’s not right. It depends on the hospital and it depends on the season. 
But he has a point that many of North Carolina’s hospitals routinely treat patients while their facilities are close to maximum capacity. So we rate his claim Half True.",Tweet,https://twitter.com/JeffJacksonNC/status/1240687991581859841,null,,null,

Roy Cooper","Cooper exaggerates immediate effect of school reopening bill




If Your Time is short




North Carolina's governor said a Republican-led bill requiring schools to reopen is “stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place.”
Not only would the bill require schools to reopen, it would allow them to operate under minimal social distancing.
However, the bill would allow school boards to choose an in-person education option that already exists.




See the sources for this fact-check




Gov. Roy Cooper says he wants North Carolina school boards to reopen in-person instruction on their own, rather than be forced by state lawmakers.
Republican legislators recently introduced a bill that would require county school boards to offer the option of in-person classes. 
When a reporter asked Cooper about it during a press conference on Tuesday, he said he hadn’t read the bill yet.
""I haven’t seen the legislation, (but) I know about it,"" Cooper said. ""I have some concerns with it, particularly stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place.""
Is it true that the GOP bill would ""strip"" some current safety protocols that are already in place?
The bill would strip school boards of flexibility. (They would no longer be allowed to offer remote-only instruction, unless there’s a COVID outbreak.) However, the bill itself does not automatically strip schools of any health protocols for in-person learning. 
The current situation
In North Carolina, Cooper is giving public school boards some flexibility to choose how they want to reopen. He’s laid out three levels of operation:


Plan A: minimal social distancing.


Plan B: moderate social distancing.


Plan C: full remote learning.


(There are specific protocols to follow for each plan. For the sake of brevity, we won’t get into those details just yet.)
So far, Cooper has given only elementary schools the ability to enact Plan A. Middle and high schools can only choose Plan B or Plan C. 
The Republican bill would require all public schools to offer Plan A or Plan B, while allowing parents the ability to still choose a remote alternative.
Cooper’s use of the word ""strip"" could give parents the impression the bill would change health protocols that are already in place. The bill does not aim to do that.

Following protocols
The bill requires schools to follow protocols laid out in the ""Strong Schools NC Public Health Toolkit"" that was developed by the health department, led by Cooper-appointee Mandy Cohen, as well as the Department of Public Instruction.
The original bill told school boards to follow toolkit guidance that ""existed on December 4, 2020."" On Wednesday, the Senate amended the bill to ensure schools follow the latest version of the toolkit, which was updated on Feb. 2. 
Cooper said Tuesday that 90 out of North Carolina’s 115 school districts already provide some in-person instruction.
Consider for a moment that your school district is already operating under a Plan B model of in-person learning. PolitiFact found no evidence that, if the bill were enacted, health protocols for Plan B would be significantly different from what they are now.
Plan A vs. Plan B
Of course, if the bill is enacted and school boards are able to choose Plan A, one could argue that would ""strip"" teachers of existing protections.
Plan A and Plan B are similar in some ways. Both require schools to mandate face coverings, conduct regular screenings for coronavirus symptoms, limit visitors, mark the floors to guide movement, and more. (Page 5 of the toolkit features a chart showing how the plans track on 10 out of 11 key guidelines.)
However, there are a few protocols required in Plan B that aren’t required under Plan A, including:


Mandating 6 feet of physical distance,


Banning more than one passenger per bus seat,


Restricting carpooling to family members.


To be clear, these differences are not insignificant. While in December experts found in-school coronavirus spread to be low, experts have also repeatedly confirmed that social distancing and spacing are key to limiting spread.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers in-person learning with minimal social distancing to be the highest-risk learning model. On MSNBC this week, the CDC director reiterated that schools can open safely only if they continued social distancing.
Our ruling
Cooper said a Republican bill that would require counties to enact in-person learning is ""stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place.""
He’s right that the bill would ""strip"" school boards of the ability to offer remote learning exclusively. Also, if the bill is enacted and local school boards opt for Plan A, one could argue that teachers would be stripped of their social distancing protection.
However, a parent whose child attends a school operating under Plan B may hear Cooper’s comments and think the Republican bill would remove some health protocols that are already in place. That doesn’t appear to be the case.
Bill sponsors say the intention is for schools to continue operating under the guidelines outlined by the Cooper administration.

Jeffrey Zients","Did U.S. pause on Johnson & Johnson vaccine help or harm vaccine confidence? Evidence is mixed




If Your Time is short



• Federal officials in April recommended resuming use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after a 10-day pause to investigate cases of blood clots among a few vaccinated people.
• A de Beaumont Foundation poll found greater enthusiasm to get a vaccination after the pause; YouGov polls show slightly declining hesitancy; and an Axios/Ipsos poll found no softening of interest in getting a vaccination despite the pause.
• However, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found rising concern about side effects after the pause was announced. And polls by Kaiser, YouGov, and ABC and the Washington Post found low and worsening trust of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after the pause was announced.



See the sources for this fact-check




In mid-April, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control recommended a ""pause"" in the administration of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine, saying that blood clots in a tiny fraction of cases required further review.
Ten days later, after completing the safety review, both agencies recommended ending the pause and resuming use of the J&J vaccine. 
The pause prompted some observers to worry that the federal action could elevate public concern about the safety of the J&J vaccine in particular, and about coronavirus vaccines in general.
These concerns were heightened by the near-simultaneous slowdown of immunization rates in most states, as the shrinking pool of unvaccinated Americans became more filled with people who were vaccine hesitant.
On May 9, Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, tried to bolster the notion that the vaccines are safe — claiming that the J&J pause only strengthened that view among the public, rather than undermining it.
""The research showed ... that confidence overall in the vaccines increased after the pause,"" Zients said on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""
When we looked at polling data, we found some evidence to support Zients’ view but also found survey results that suggest damage has been done to the public’s view of J&J’s vaccine in particular, and perhaps to the others. The picture is more mixed than either solely positive or negative.
Evidence backing up Zients’ assertion
One piece of evidence that supports Zients’ case comes from a survey sponsored by the de Beaumont Foundation and conducted by pollster Frank Luntz.
The survey, which was taken a few days after the pause was announced, found that overall, 40% of respondents said they were more likely to get one of the vaccines than they had been a month before.
Meanwhile, weekly polls by YouGov for The Economist have shown slightly declining hesitancy about getting vaccinated since before the pause began. In the poll taken from April 3 to April 6, prior to the pause, 40% of respondents either said they wouldn’t get vaccinated or weren’t sure about getting vaccinated. In the subsequent four polls, that number was 41%, 35%, 33%, and 32%, with the final poll taken between May 1 and May 4.
Another poll, sponsored by the media outlet Axios and conducted by the research firm Ipsos, found no evidence of wider vaccine hesitancy after the pause was announced.
The Axios poll, which was taken several days after the de Beaumont poll, found that 20% of respondents said they were ""not at all likely"" to get the vaccine as soon as it was available to them. That percentage has shown little change since it was asked in early January 2021.
Another data point suggests that Americans felt comfortable with the pause. The Axios poll found that 91% of respondents were aware of the pause, and that of those, 88% said it was a responsible decision. (When we asked the White House for support for Zients’ statement, a spokesperson directed PolitiFact to both the de Beaumont and Axios polls.)

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Finally, some polling evidence suggests that while J&J’s vaccine was hit by a decline in confidence, the two other vaccines used in the United States, one produced by Pfizer and BioNTech and the other by Moderna, were spared.
On the one hand, the Economist/YouGov poll, which surveyed Americans both before and after the pause began, found confidence in the J&J vaccine declining after the pause. Among respondents who answered before the pause was announced, 52% considered it to be ""very safe"" or ""somewhat safe."" That fell to 37% for respondents who answered after the pause was made public.
Yet that decline was not mirrored in their view of Pfizer and Moderna. For both those vaccines, nearly 60% of respondents said they believed they were safe — numbers that were essentially unchanged from prior surveys.
Another poll, by Dynata for CNBC, showed similar results. 
The first choice brand for respondents was Pfizer, at 35%, followed by Moderna and J&J at 17% each. That result marked a significant dropoff for J&J compared with the previous month’s version of the poll, which found that the J&J vaccine — which unlike the other two can be taken in a single shot — had been the favorite of 29%. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, by contrast, both increased their share on this question.
Other polling shows some caveats
The strongest evidence against Zients’ assertion comes from a poll taken by the Kaiser Family Foundation in the second half of April. 
Among those who said they were not yet convinced they should get the vaccine right away, 81% reported that they worried about serious side effects from the vaccine — an increase from 70% the prior month. For women, who accounted for the bulk of the reports of blood clots among J&J recipients, concern increased even more. The share with those concerns rose 15 percentage points, from 77% in March to 92% in April.
Meanwhile, other surveys mirrored the YouGov poll’s finding that public concern about the safety of J&J’s vaccine was higher than for either Pfizer or Moderna.
The Kaiser poll found that 46% believed the J&J vaccine was safe, far below the 69% who said the same for both Pfizer and Moderna. This sentiment was even more pronounced among respondents who told Kaiser they would ""wait and see"" about whether to get a vaccination — essentially, the group of ""vaccine hesitant"" Americans. Among these respondents, more than half said they thought Pfizer and Moderna were safe, compared with just 28% who said they believed J&J was safe.
The ABC News-Washington Post poll found similar discrepancies by brand. After the pause, slightly fewer than half of respondents considered the J&J vaccine to be ""very"" or ""somewhat"" safe, compared with better than 7 in 10 respondents for two rival vaccines. And among respondents who were not yet immunized, J&J’s reputation was even worse — fewer than one-third said it was safe.
Our ruling
Zients said ""the research showed … that confidence overall in the vaccines increased after the pause"" to review the safety of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine.
There is evidence to support his assertion. A de Beaumont Foundation poll found greater enthusiasm to get a vaccination after the pause; YouGov polls show slightly declining hesitancy; and an Axios/Ipsos poll found no softening of interest in getting a vaccination despite the pause.
However, there’s also evidence that the pause worried Americans. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found rising concerns about side effects after the pause was announced. And polls by Kaiser, YouGov and ABC and the Washington Post found low and — after the pause was announced — worsening trust of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, even if that did not spill over into sentiments about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

What more people are saying is that as we learn more about COVID-19, we should evaluate the total societal cost of this awful disease and try to put things into perspective. …
Imagine the potential psychological and human toll if this shutdown continues indefinitely, unemployment reaches 20% or higher, as some now predict, and we sink into a deep recession or depression.
Johnson says social distancing ""should continue until this outbreak is under control.""
But he did also reference death being unavoidable. Here’s the full context for that line:
Every premature death is a tragedy, but death is an unavoidable part of life. More than 2.8 million die each year — nearly 7,700 a day. The 2017-18 flu season was exceptionally bad, with 61,000 deaths attributed to it. Can you imagine the panic if those mortality statistics were attributed to a new virus and reported nonstop?
Johnson goes on to call for reversing the current labeling of ""essential businesses,"" saying we should instead determine nonessential business ""that pose a risk for coronavirus spread."" He said those could be shut down and financial support provided to the employees and businesses until they can re-open.
The brief story linked in the Facebook post describes Johnson’s position more accurately than the headline, though it also opens by labeling him ""the living embodiment of clueless privilege.""
Our ruling
A viral Facebook post said Johnson is saying ""Americans should go back to work, because 'death is an unavoidable part of life.'""
Johnson did use the line about death being unavoidable, but the headline exaggerates his position, implying he thinks all or most people should go back to work. He explicitly says he supports social distancing and keeping some businesses closed at this point.

Joe Biden","Do a majority of Republicans support Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan?




If Your Time is short





President Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan is expected to reach a vote in the House in late February and the Senate by mid-March.


The White House cited a CBS poll that showed 70% of Republicans approve of Congress passing an additional economic relief package that would provide funds to people and businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. The question did not mention Biden or the $1.9 trillion price tag.


Quinnipiac and SurveyMonkey/New York Times polls found less than majority support among Republicans for the plan.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Joe Biden made a forceful pitch to Republicans in Congress to ""listen to their constituents"" and pass his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to help Americans recover from the pandemic.
""According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support,"" Biden said Feb. 19 at a Pfizer plant in Michigan that produces vaccines. ""The vast majority of the American people — more than 70% of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including a majority of Republicans — want us to act, and act big and quickly and support the plan.""
The House is expected to vote on the American Rescue Plan before the end of February, while the Senate is expected to take it up by mid-March. The legislation includes a $1,400 cash payment, aid to help K-12 schools open and money for vaccinations and unemployment assistance. Republican lawmakers have criticized Biden’s plan, with some GOP senators proposing a smaller package.
Polls in late January and February found that most Americans do support Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan. But when we fact-checked his claim that a majority of Republicans support it, we found those who identify as Republican were generally less favorable to the aid package, even if they supported some elements of it.
What the polls show about the American Rescue Plan
The White House cited one poll to back up Biden’s statement about Republican support. A CBS poll conducted by YouGov asked respondents: ""Would you approve or disapprove of Congress passing an additional economic relief package that would provide funds to people and businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak?"" In response, 70% of Republicans said they approved, while 95% of Democrats approved.
The question did not include the $1.9 trillion price tag, or mention Biden’s name. A subsequent question asked respondents if they think the economic relief package is ""too much,"" ""not enough"" or ""about the right amount."" Among Republicans, 38% said the package is too much, while 27% said not enough and 34% said about the right amount.
Two other polls showed less support among Republicans. In those polls, the questions mentioned the $1.9 trillion cost and Biden’s name.
Quinnipiac asked adults: ""You may know, the Biden administration has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus relief bill in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Do you support or oppose this bill?"" The poll showed 68% support his $1.9 trillion plan overall, but 47% of Republicans said they were opposed, with 16% offering no opinion. In a subsequent question, a majority of Republicans indicated they support a $1,400 stimulus payment.
SurveyMonkey/New York Times asked respondents ""Do you approve or disapprove of President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which would provide federal support to individuals and businesses impacted by the coronavirus?"" The poll found that 72% overall approved, but among Republicans, 56% disapproved.
Asked about certain components of the package, the majority of Republicans identified the $1,400 checks, COVID-19 vaccine distribution and money for state and local governments and schools as important elements.
The wording of poll questions matters
Polls can find different answers to questions on the same topic depending upon the precise wording of the question and whether they include partisan cues.
John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to the wording in the CBS/YouGov poll, which asked about ""economic relief"" and not ""stimulus.""
""Republicans may favor ‘economic relief’ more than ‘stimulus relief,’"" or package, said Geer, who co-directs the Vanderbilt Poll. ""Stimulus is governmental activism, which GOPers tend not to support.""
Another likely factor is that the CBS question asked about Congress, while the other polls mentioned Biden. ""Mentioning Biden activates partisanship,"" Geer said. ""Even though Congress is controlled by the (Democrats), the wording is not as likely to activate that.""

Barry C. Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said surveys conducted over the years have shown that mentioning the president’s name in a question creates more resistance from members of the opposite party.
""Compared with other surveys, the CBS/YouGov poll finds more support among Republicans for two reasons: It does not mention the price tag and it does not mention President Biden,"" Burden said.
Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said including the cost of the bill in the question probably gave many Republicans pause.
""Including both the cost and a Democratic president’s name could also have inclined many Republicans to oppose it,"" Bowman said.
Including the cost of the legislation ""highlights a downside of the bill without necessarily drawing attention to its benefits,"" said Burden.
Andrew E. Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said the wording of the questions is critical, because most people probably don’t know the details about what is in the American Rescue Plan.
""I would be surprised that more than 2% of the public could actually tell you what is in the proposal, so they are simply relying on the wording of the question — who favors it, who opposes it, what the question says it will do etc.,"" Smith said.
Our ruling
Biden said, ""The vast majority of the American people"" support Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue plan, ""including a majority of Republicans.""
The White House cited a poll by CBS that found 70% of Republicans approve of Congress passing an additional economic relief package to provide funds to people and businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. But two other polls that included more details in their questions — Quinnipiac and SurveyMonkey/New York Times — found less than majority support among Republicans for the American Rescue Plan.

Coronavirus







Joe Biden","Under Donald Trump, key CDC US staff in China fell to 0




If Your Time is short





The correct figures from the CDC show that overall staffing fell but remained higher than what Biden said. 


The numbers also show the elimination of all U.S. staff to counter the threat posed by the new coronavirus.





See the sources for this fact-check




Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, argues that President Donald Trump failed to protect the country from the coronavirus when he had the chance. In an interview on MSNBC, Biden said Trump ""absolutely missed any opportunity to get ahead of this."" 
Biden underscored the loss of American staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Beijing.
""We had over 44, if I’m not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, in China to observe what was going on,"" Biden said May 14. ""The president brought home the vast majority of them, I think left only four in place.""
This is an intriguing claim. Biden is off on the exact numbers. But his point about stripped-down oversight is supported. According to the CDC, the program in China specifically charged with spotting new infectious diseases went from having four American staff in 2017 to none by 2019.
It’s impossible to say with 100% certainty that if those Americans had been there, they would have been able to alert Washington earlier to an emerging threat. But not having them there eliminated that possibility.
CDC China staffing
Biden indicated he was a bit unsure of the exact numbers, and what he offered was an inconsistent blend of American and Chinese staff figures. He said there were 44 people ""from the CDC in China."" The actual number was 47 in March 2019 and that included eight Americans and 39 Chinese.
When he said the number fell to four, the actual number by December 2019 was three Americans, and 11 Chinese.
Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said the reduction mattered regardless.
""Donald Trump dramatically reduced America's CDC footprint in China, removing vital positions that would have provided the U.S. with a critical early warning as the virus spread,"" Gwin said.
Biden leveled this charge before in a slightly different way. In March, he said the U.S.  had one person in-country and Trump ""pulled him out."" At the time, the details were murky. An American epidemiologist had left, but some Americans remained.
The CDC has now shared more specific information with PolitiFact that breaks down the staffing for each of the offices and programs in its China bureau. 
The new details show that the single greatest staff decline was in the HIV/AIDS program, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It went from one American and 10 Chinese employees to none.
But the Global Health Protection program saw the largest reduction in U.S. staff. That program went from four Americans and 10 Chinese staff down to no Americans and five Chinese.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







The CDC website touts that program as training ""new disease detectives, who are critical to countries’ abilities to quickly find and stop disease outbreaks."" The program emerged out of the Ebola crisis and sent American specialists around the world to work with infectious disease experts and build capacity in over 50 countries.
That mission directly applied to the outbreak of what became known as COVID-19. And at the time of the outbreak, the United States had no American staffer in the CDC office in Beijing.
There is no way to say for sure that if more Americans had been in the CDC office, Washington would have had critical information sooner than it did. Former CDC chief Tom Frieden, now CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an epidemic response training organization, told PolitiFact it might have.
On the other hand, the timeline for the emergence of the new coronavirus was very compressed. It wasn’t until Dec. 30 that a doctor in Wuhan first flagged that he was seeing patients with a new respiratory disease. The doctor later documented how local officials quickly accused him of spreading rumors.
By Jan. 10, he was infected and had to go to the hospital, where he later died. By Jan. 14, the World Health Organization was discussing the possibility of human-to-human transmission. On Jan. 20, the Chinese government declared that the outbreak was an emergency.
Trump’s role
Biden said Trump ""brought home"" the CDC specialists. They did leave on Trump’s watch, but it’s worth noting the budget factors that directly hit the Global Health Protection program.
The effort emerged from the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Congress gave the CDC about $600 million to boost capacity worldwide to spot and contain new infectious diseases. That money ran out in 2019.
The head of the CDC’s Center for Global Health told staff in January 2018 that the program would be reduced to 10 countries. China was not on the list. That more targeted approach was part of the White House’s 2019 global health strategy.
The White House’s FY 2020 plan did not replenish the Ebola money that ran out in 2019. The total global health security budget, which included a range of activities beyond the sort of work in China, went from $504 million in 2019 to a White House request for $482 million in 2020. We reached out to the White House and got no comment.
A group representing about 200 global health organizations appealed to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in January 2018 for money to keep the program going.
""The ongoing danger that biological threats pose to American health, economic, and national security interests demands dedicated and steady funding for global health security,"" the group wrote.
Our ruling
Biden said that Trump ""brought home"" the vast majority of CDC staff in China, taking manpower from 44 down to four. He garbled the numbers. The actual staffing went from eight Americans and 39 Chinese (47), to three Americans and 11 Chinese (14).
But within that, the American staff working specifically on new threats like COVID-19 went from four to zero.
It is unclear whether the presence of those Americans would have provided an early warning. But the former head of the CDC said it was possible, and many global health groups lobbied for the overall program to continue. The White House decided not to ask for funds to maintain that program in China.
Biden was off on his numbers, but the specific staffing details we later found add weight to the thrust of his argument.

Lovely Warren","Rochester mayor lacked context on coronavirus’ racial disparities




If Your Time is short



• At the time of her comment, the share of African American deaths from the coronavirus in Monroe County, N.Y., was only slightly higher than the African American share of the county’s population.
• However, African Americans accounted for a significantly higher share of intensive care unit hospitalizations and non-ICU hospitalizations in the county. The same was the case for Hispanics and non-ICU hospitalizations.



See the sources for this fact-check




As the coronavirus spreads across the country, officials are taking increasing notice of patterns of infections and deaths among people of different races. 
In some states, provisional data through April 21 collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed disproportionately high rates of death from coronavirus among African Americans in Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, and Wisconsin. Experts have suggested that a variety of factors may be responsible, including disparities in income and health insurance and a higher rate of pre-existing conditions.
The question of racial disparities in coronavirus impact came up during an April 8 news conference with Lovely Warren, the mayor of Rochester, N.Y. 
Warren opened the press conference by saying, ""I'm going to answer some questions you have regarding disparities across the country happening in the African American community as it pertains to the coronavirus and the number of deaths and the number of people being diagnosed with it.""
A reporter asked, ""What are we seeing locally here in Rochester? How badly is Rochester being impacted, especially the minority population?""
Warren responded, ""We are not seeing, at a high rate, that level of disparity right now,"" Warren said. ""We do believe if we do not change the social distancing, if we do not stay at home, we will see the level of disparity that we see across the country. … Today we are basically on par, a little bit up, from the population numbers, but we don’t see that disparity as much here in Monroe County as we’re seeing across the country.""
However, the disparities were already evident on the day Warren held the press conference.
On the same day as the press conference, the Monroe County Department of Health released the racial and ethnic breakdown of coronavirus hospitalizations in the county, both in non-intensive care units and ICUs, as well as deaths from the virus.
Here’s a summary of that data:

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The health department data shows that for African Americans, the percentage of deaths from coronavirus was slightly higher than their share of the population -- African American residents accounted for 18.2% of deaths, compared to 16.2% of the county’s overall population. That was in line with Warren’s comment.
However, the hospitalization rates for African Americans in the county were significantly higher. African Americans accounted for 27.9% of the non-ICU hospitalizations in the county and 53.8% of ICU hospitalizations.
Meanwhile, non-ICU hospitalizations were disproportionately high for Hispanics -- 18.6% of such hospitalizations, compared to an overall 9% share of the population.
Warren did acknowledge this fact in passing later in her press conference, saying, ""What we do know is that people in the ICU, people of color, are in the ICU at a higher rate than other folks."" However, on multiple occasions during the press conference she referred to the disparities as minor. 
Justin Roj, the mayor’s director of communications and special events, said Warren stands by her statement.
A footnote: Subsequent data has shown that the racial disparity has grown. Here’s a look at the data through April 17:

 
The data shows that through April 17, African American hospitalization rates had grown to 67% of ICU hospitalizations and 39% of non-ICU hospitalization rates. And the share of deaths represented by African Americans rose to 24%, which exceeds African Americans’ 16% share of the county’s population.
Meanwhile, Hispanics have accounted for 22% of ICU hospitalizations, which is more than double their 9% of the population.
Our ruling 
Referring to racial comparisons on coronavirus statistics in Monroe County, N.Y., Warren said the impact on minorities is ""basically on par, a little bit up, from the population numbers,"" meaning that ""we don’t see that disparity as much here.""
That was essentially accurate when looking at the share of deaths from the coronavirus. But at the time of her comment, African Americans accounted for a significantly higher share of ICU and non-ICU hospitalizations in the county, and the same was the case for Hispanics and non-ICU hospitalizations.

If Your Time is short




A Pennsylvania congressman said the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. matches the spread of the virus in South Korea, not Italy. The U.S. and South Korea have similar case fatality rates – Italy’s is higher – but all three countries have age-specific mortality rates that are about the same.
Public health experts say the fatality rate wouldn’t be the only or the most important metric used to determine when businesses may reopen.The growth in cases and hospitals’ capacity to treat new patients is the most important factor.




See the sources for this fact-check




Last week, U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick spoke about the coronavirus pandemic on a local talk radio show, and he told the host that the outbreak in this country looks more like the one in South Korea than the one in Italy.
""We’ve got to give the American public a rough estimate of how long we think this is going to take, based mostly on the South Korean model, which seems to be the trajectory that we are on, thankfully, and not the Italian model,"" the Republican congressman from Bucks County said on The Dom Giordano Program.
We wondered how the spread of the coronavirus in the United States compares with the spread of the disease in other parts of the world.
When Fitzpatrick made those remarks, he was comparing the three countries’ case fatality rates, said Will Kiley, his spokesperson. That’s ""the key metric we’re all watching,"" he added.
Fitzpatrick is right that the fatality rate in the United States roughly matches South Korea’s and is far lower than Italy’s. But Drexel epidemiologist Michael LeVasseur cautioned against reading too much into those numbers.
The virus appears to be deadlier in Italy because the population there is older, and elderly coronavirus patients are the most likely to die. For example, 23% of people in Italy are over age 65, compared with only 14% in South Korea and 16% in the U.S.
The age-specific case fatality rates in the three countries are about the same, LeVasseur said.
He also pointed out that the curve epidemiologists keep talking about depicts the number of coronavirus patients and hospitals’ capacity to care for them — not deaths caused by the virus. ""Flattening the curve"" means slowing the virus’ rate of transmission and reducing the number of new cases so that fewer sick people need to seek treatment all at once.

By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







The latest data on coronavirus cases show that South Korea did flatten the curve, while case counts in the United States and Italy keep climbing.
Another way to compare the virus’ impact in the three countries is to look at their economies.
Fitzpatrick’s comments came amid a discussion with Giordano about the economic pain the virus has already inflicted on Pennsylvania business owners, and how much longer the closures ordered by Gov. Tom Wolf might last. The congressman argued that businesses need to know when things will go back to normal if they have any hope of surviving this crisis.
In South Korea, businesses have remained open even as the country fights the virus, whereas in Italy, businesses have been closed for weeks.
The latest modeling suggests the outbreak will peak in the United States in two weeks. But that doesn’t mean that Pennsylvania businesses should necessarily expect to reopen by May, said Nate Wardel, a spokesperson for the State Department of Health. The scarcity of coronavirus tests and the time it takes to get results remain the biggest hurdles to relaxing restrictions.
Asked whether Wolf would use the state’s case fatality rate to determine when businesses may reopen, Wardle said it would be one of several metrics used to make that call. And no, he said, the similarity between the fatality rate in the United States and South Korea doesn’t mean Pennsylvania is ready for South Korea-style normalcy.

Joe Biden","Many Americans say they don’t want a vaccine. Should we be worried?




If Your Time is short



• Most polls have found between 50% and 70% of Americans willing to get vaccinated, which is not as high as epidemiologists would like to see if a vaccine is to fully eradicate the coronavirus. 
• Polls show that skepticism is even higher among racial and ethnic minorities. Those groups have been hit especially hard by the disease.
• Despite these findings, experts aren’t despairing yet. History has shown that concerted educational efforts can help increase comfort with new vaccines, and a smooth rollout with early recipients should make people more willing to get their shots.



See the sources for this fact-check




A vaccine to prevent coronavirus infections is tantalizingly close, with the first inoculations in the United States weeks or even days away. But concern persists that not enough Americans will be willing to be vaccinated to fully halt the virus’ spread.
President-elect Joe Biden raised this concern during a Dec. 3 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.
When Tapper asked whether Biden planned to be vaccinated before he’s inaugurated on Jan. 20, Biden said he would.
""People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work,"" Biden said. ""Already, the numbers are really staggeringly low. And it matters what a president and a vice president do. … And it's important to communicate to the American people it's safe to do this.""
We interviewed seven experts for this story. They expressed disappointment with Americans’ relatively low willingness to take the vaccine so far, and they were especially concerned about deeper skepticism of a vaccine among racial minorities. But they added that these early findings do not mean that the effort is doomed.
Most of the polling so far has asked about a vaccine that was still theoretical. Now, several vaccines have been presented to regulators with strong initial results, and if the initial rollouts are smooth — and if targeted educational efforts begin to have an effect — the experts expect Americans to become more comfortable with taking a vaccine. (The Biden campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)
What the polling shows
Since May, at least seven pollsters have taken a look at Americans’ willingness to receive a coronavirus vaccine. 
Most polls have found between 50% and 70% of respondents willing to get vaccinated. (Some of the differences may stem from differences in how the question was worded in each poll.)

 
Respondents’ stated willingness to receive the vaccine fell in the summer and the early fall before recovering somewhat in October and November.
Observers said this might have to do with early, positive results for several vaccine trials — making a vaccine less theoretical to Americans — or relief among Democratic survey respondents that Joe Biden will be president during most of the vaccine rollout, rather than Donald Trump.
To understand the public’s wariness about a coronavirus vaccine, it helps to take into account ""the politicization of the virus and seemingly everything surrounding it, as well as the level of misinformation being circulated,"" said Jason Salemi, an associate professor of public health at the University of South Florida.
Why the current level of willingness to be vaccinated is worrisome
While less-than-optimal levels of vaccination will still help ease the pandemic, epidemiologists say that something approaching full eradication can occur only if most people receive their shots.
""Given what we know about the virus so far, we are going to need higher proportions of people to take the vaccine then who are now saying they will for protection to occur on a population level,"" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor in Claremont Graduate University’s school of community and global health.
An especially important issue is that some subgroups of the population are less welcoming of a coronavirus vaccine than the public at large.
While 33% of white respondents to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll said they would probably not or definitely not take the vaccine, the rates were higher for Hispanics (37%) and Blacks (49%).
A survey by the COVID Collaborative found that 14% of Black respondents and 34% of Hispanic respondents said they mostly or completely trust that a vaccine will be safe. Only 18% of Black respondents and 40% of Hispanic respondents said they mostly or completely trust that a vaccine will be effective.
Most analysts attribute the hesitancy about vaccines in the Black community to a legacy of unethical medical experimentation, as well as longstanding disparities in the quality of health care available to racial minorities.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







""There are historical reasons that justify that caution and skepticism,"" said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine, health policy and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. 
If Black Americans do end up forgoing vaccination at especially high rates, it could be especially problematic, since rates of illness and death from COVID-19 have been higher for Blacks than for whites. One reason for this may be their added risk of exposure.
""Minority groups are overrepresented among essential workers, and these are groups that are among the most important for the vaccine to reach,"" Gatto said.
The eventual response could be better than the polls say now
Before assuming widespread vaccine skepticism will lead to poor vaccination rates, it’s worth noting some context.
Flu vaccination coverage among adults in the United States has fluctuated between 37% and 48% in the past decade, Salemi said. Compared against the widely available vaccine for the flu, the survey data for a coronavirus vaccine is ""not ‘staggering,’"" Salemi said. 
In addition, there’s evidence that older Americans — those who are more susceptible to the virus’ worst impacts — are more willing to get vaccinated. For instance, a CNN poll in October found that 60% of those age 65 and older said they would try to get a vaccine, compared with 49% among those younger than 45. 
And history suggests that concerted public education campaigns can help boost low public confidence.
""Successful mass-vaccination campaigns have been carried out previously in the United States, including for polio in the 1950s and more recently for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,"" said Matthew B. Laurens, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. ""Maintenance of public trust will depend on clear messages to the public regarding vaccine benefits and side effects, transparency of vaccine developers and researchers regarding what is known and is not known about available vaccines for COVID-19, and continuous engagement and dialogue with communities and individuals.""
Campaigns can work well by leveraging community members, faith leaders, celebrities and athletes — ""people who can demonstrate by example,"" Gatto said.
Ultimately, though, one of the biggest factors driving lower-than-desired public approval of a coronavirus vaccine is simply an understandable caution about trying something new.
""A dose of healthy skepticism is normal,"" Schaffner said. ""These are new vaccines with new technologies against a new virus."" 
Experts agree that the public’s view of vaccines can change, since Americans are being bombarded every day by new information about the virus and possible vaccines.
""We have to be realistic about the ebb and flow as more information comes out about the particular vaccines — how the initial vaccination efforts go, and what happens to the first folks taking it,"" said Mollyann Brodie, executive vice president for public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
""Even today, we don't yet have a vaccine that has been given the green light by the FDA, and most of these surveys were taken before data from Moderna and Pfizer were released,"" added Tara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist. 
Experts express cautious optimism that a smooth rollout will ease concerns among Americans who are currently reluctant. ""I do think the comfort level with the vaccine will indeed increase over time,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.
Also important to remember ""is that we have some time,"" Schaffner said. ""We can’t vaccinate everybody in a week and a half.""
Our ruling
Biden said, ""People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work. Already, the numbers are really staggeringly low.""
Experts agree that the initial percentages of Americans saying they’re willing to take the vaccine are lower than would be ideal to fully eradicate the coronavirus, and that the numbers are especially low among racial and ethnic minorities even though those groups have been hit disproportionately by the pandemic.
However, experts aren’t despairing yet, because they see public opinion as fluid and likely to be shaped by new information, including regulatory approvals and the rollout of the actual vaccines. History has also shown that concerted educational efforts can help increase comfort with new vaccines.

Tony Evers","Wisconsin Republicans passed one COVID bill before long period of inaction




If Your Time is short





Imprecise wording leaves this claim open to multiple interpretations.


There was a 300-day span where legislators didn’t pass any bills.


But the Legislature did pass a COVID-19 bill in April 2020, weeks after the governor issued his “Safer at Home” order.





See the sources for this fact-check





Amid a pandemic that changed almost every part of Wisconsin life in 2020, one thing was nearly constant — inaction from the Republican-led Legislature.
In October, we rated True a claim that Wisconsin Republicans hadn’t passed a single bill in six months, a streak that ultimately ran through the end of the year. We noted Wisconsin lawmakers had done less than almost any other state to address the pandemic despite being one of just 10 full-time Legislatures in the nation.
That streak ended in February. Republicans passed a $100 million COVID response bill that was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, but the two sides came together later that month on a bill that overhauled the state unemployment system while also expanding jobless benefits and protecting businesses and governments from coronavirus-related lawsuits.
A month later, Evers took aim at the Republicans’ pandemic record while pitching his plan to spend $3.2 billion in new federal coronavirus aid.
""It took the Legislature nearly 300 days to act on a #COVID19 bill during this pandemic,"" Evers tweeted on March 30, 2021. ""We simply cannot afford to waste any time or let Republicans play politics and prevent these funds from going to folks who need our help.""
Let’s take a closer look at that 300 days claim.
Multiple ways to read it
The key question is how one interprets Evers’ reference, which is imprecise.
Many would no doubt take this statement to mean the Legislature didn’t pass a COVID-19 bill for the first 300 days of the pandemic. And that’s inaccurate.

Made workers’ compensation available to healthcare workers who contracted COVID-19 (though controversially only if they could prove they were exposed while working on a person with the virus)


Suspended the one-week waiting period before people who are out of work may collect unemployment benefits


Provided insurance protection for those infected with coronavirus and shielded health care providers from liability


Barred insurers from charging people more to get COVID-19 treatment out of network


Required insurers to cover coronavirus testing for free


That bill, however, was the last coronavirus-related action the Legislature passed for about 300 days. That’s the point Evers was making, said spokeswoman Britt Cudaback.
""The tweet says a COVID-19 bill because it did, in fact, take the Legislature nearly 300 days to pass a COVID-19 bill, and not for lack of the governor’s or public’s urging to pass it sooner,"" Cudaback said in an email.
The phrasing could also be taken to say the Legislature stalled a particular bill for 300 days, which is also inaccurate. Evers raised a variety of potential bills during that legislative drought, but no specific bill that was ignored for that length of time.
Sinec February 2021, the Legislature has passed several other COVID-related bills, including measures that allowed pharmacy technicians, pharmacy students and dentists to administer the vaccine.
Our ruling
Evers said, ""It took the Legislature nearly 300 days to act on a (COVID-19) bill during this pandemic.""
It didn’t take 300 days for the Legislature to take any action on the pandemic, as a wide-ranging bill was signed into law in April 2020. But the Republican-run Senate and Assembly did take a 300-day hiatus from passing legislation after that point, which stretched all the way to February 2021.

Facebook posts","Fact-check: Hospitals and COVID-19 payments




If Your Time is short





It’s standard for Medicare to pay a hospital roughly three times as much for a patient who goes on a ventilator, as for one who doesn’t.


Medicare is paying a 20% add-on to its regular hospital payments for the treatment of COVID-19 victims. That’s a result of a federal stimulus law.


The claim’s suggestion is that the number of COVID-19 cases is being padded; but evidence indicates the cases are being undercounted.





See the sources for this fact-check




An article shared on Facebook questions whether the count of COVID-19 patients is inflated, saying hospitals have a financial incentive to claim that a patient has the virus.
""Hospitals get paid more to list patients as COVID-19 — 3 times as much if put on ventilator,"" the story’s headline states.
The article was posted on WorldNetDaily, a conservative news website. It was produced by The Spectator, which describes itself as a conservative publication. The Spectator reported on comments made by Dr. Scott Jensen, a Minnesota physician and Republican state senator, in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham.
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Jensen said on Fox News that doctors are being encouraged to cite COVID-19 as a cause of death on death certificates and he suggested that money is a motivation.
Medicare has determined that a hospital gets paid $13,000 if a COVID-19 patient on Medicare is admitted and $39,000 if the patient goes on a ventilator, he claimed.
Jensen did not respond to our request for information.
The federal government has decided to pay hospitals more for treating COVID-19 patients. But it isn’t a windfall in the way the headline suggests. And there is no indication that hospitals are over-identifying patients as having COVID-19. If anything, evidence suggests the illness is being underdiagnosed. 
How Medicare pays hospitals
Medicare pays for inpatient hospital stays using a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system. The hospital assigns a code to a patient at the time of discharge, based mainly on the patient’s main diagnosis and treatment given. 
Medicare then pays the hospital a prescribed amount of money — regardless of what it actually cost the hospital to provide the care. The amount can vary in different parts of the country to account for labor costs and other factors.
The amounts 
The dollar amounts Jensen cited are roughly what we found in an analysis published April 7 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading source of health information. (Kaiser Health News, which partners with PolitiFact on health fact-checking, is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
There isn’t a Medicare diagnostic code specifically for COVID-19. Using payment rates for similar respiratory conditions, Kaiser estimated the average Medicare payment at $13,297 for a less severe hospitalization and $40,218 for hospitalization in which a patient is treated with a ventilator for at least 96 hours.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







""A COVID patient on a ventilator will need more services and more complicated services, not just the ventilator,"" said Joseph Antos, scholar in health care at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It is reasonable that a patient who is on a ventilator would cost three times one who isn't that sick.""
Medicare will pay hospitals a 20% ""add-on"" to the regular DRG payment for COVID-19 patients. That’s a result of the CARES Act, the largest of the three federal stimulus laws enacted in response to the coronavirus, which was signed into law March 27.
""This is no scandal,"" Antos said. ""The 20% was added by Congress because hospitals have lost revenue from routine care and elective surgeries that they can't provide during this crisis, and because the cost of providing even routine services to COVID patients has jumped.""
Julie Aultman, a member of the editorial board of the American Medical Association’s AMA Journal of Ethics, told PolitiFact it is ""very unlikely that physicians or hospitals will falsify data or be motivated by money to do so.""
""There are strict policies for reporting and, quite frankly, healthcare workers are only focusing on helping their patients and doing as much as they can with little resources,"" said Aultman, who is director of the medical ethics and humanities program at Northeast Ohio Medical University. ""Ohio is reporting confirmed and suspected cases and so this is how our providers are responding to their patients -- they are being very transparent about confirmed versus suspected.""
Indications of COVID-19 undercounts
As for the suggestion that there is an overcount of COVID-19 cases, ""the data has suggested that, in fact, there’s a significant undercount of deaths due to COVID,"" Jennifer Kates, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s director of global health & HIV policy, told PolitiFact.
Here are some of those indications:
Strict federal definition: Until April 14, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted as COVID-19 deaths only those in which the coronavirus was confirmed in a laboratory test — even as testing was not widely available; now, CDC counts probable cases and deaths. The day the change was announced, New York City’s COVID-19 death tally soared by more than 3,700 when it included in its total the deaths of people who were suspected of having COVID-19 but were never tested. 
Surge in total deaths: The Economist reported on ""excess mortality,"" which is the gap between the total number of people who died from any cause during a given period, and the historical average for the same place and time of year. In New York City, for the four-week period ending March 28, there was an excess of about 1,400 deaths, compared with 1,100 official COVID-19 fatalities.
Our ruling
A post shared on Facebook claims hospitals have a financial incentive to claim patients had COVID-19, saying payment is three times higher if a patient goes on a ventilator. An article the post links to includes comments from a doctor who suggests the number of coronavirus cases is being padded.
It is standard for Medicare to pay roughly three times more for a patient with a respiratory condition who goes on a ventilator than for one who does not. That has nothing to do with the coronavirus.
As part of a federal stimulus bill, Medicare is paying hospitals 20% more than standard rates for COVID-19 patients.
Indications are that due to a lack of testing and other factors, the number of coronavirus cases has been undercounted, not padded.

Joe Biden","Trade wars hit farmers hard, but Biden attack on Trump oversimplifies




If Your Time is short





Farmers were particularly hard hit by retaliatory tariffs imposed on the U.S. after Trump slapped tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico and other countries in 2018 and 2019.


Family farm bankruptcies rose from 498 in 2018 to 595 in 2019.


But farm bankruptcies have been rising each year since 2014.


And experts say the trade wars were just one factor driving the increase, along with low commodity prices and natural disasters.





See the sources for this fact-check




In wide-ranging recent comments criticizing President Donald Trump, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden touched on a topic that hits home in Wisconsin — struggling farms.
Speaking in Manitowoc on Sept. 21, 2020, Biden said Trump started a trade war that ""led to a surge in farm bankruptcies.""
To be sure, times are tough for Wisconsin farmers, particularly in dairy. 
In 2019 alone, Wisconsin lost 818 dairy farms, part of an accelerating decline in which about one-quarter of the state’s dairy farms have gone out of business since 2014.
But amid such a long-running trend, is it fair to put the onus for a ""surge"" on Trump’s trade wars?
Let’s dig in.
The trade wars took a toll
Campaigning as a dealmaker in 2016, Trump promised to renegotiate U.S. trade deals in America’s favor, and once in office he imposed tariffs seeking to achieve that end.
Many countries — including China, Canada, Mexico — as well as the European Union retaliated with tariffs of their own that struck U.S. agricultural products.
Between July 2018 and August 2019, for example, the Brookings Institution reported the U.S. announced tariffs on more than $550 billion in Chinese products, and China retaliated with tariffs on more than $185 billion on U.S. products. U.S. producers were doubly hit since numerous studies showed the U.S. companies primarily paid for the U.S. tariffs.
The toll on farmers was heavy enough the federal government created the Market Facilitation Program, which paid out more than $14 billion to farmers in 2018 and 2019 to mitigate the impact of the trade wars.
Farm bankruptcies rose
Amid this environment, farm bankruptcies did rise in 2019 — the point where you’d expect to see a spike given the trade battles occurring at the time.
That year, 595 family farmers filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcies nationwide, up from 498 filings a year earlier, Reuters and others reported. Chapter 12 is a bankruptcy code created during the 1980s farm crisis to allow family farmers and small fishing operations to keep operating while they work out plans to repay lenders.
Wisconsin led the nation with 57 bankruptcy filings, 16 more than any other state.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







But experts say you can’t draw a dark line between the trade wars and the rise in bankruptcies.
Though the jump from 2018 to 2019 was the largest in recent years, bankruptcies have been rising for a while.
After Chapter 12 bankruptcies dropped from 723 in 2010 to 361 in 2014, the number has steadily grown since.

Farm bankruptcies did drop slightly in the first half of 2020 — the total of 284 was down 10 from the same period in 2019 — but that was ""due in large part"" to government payments made to farmers as part of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
RELATED: Dems exaggerate in slamming Trump farm bailouts as ""handout for large agricultural companies""
In addition, trade wars are far from the only factor at play for farmers in Wisconsin and nationwide.
Reuters described it this way:
The increase in (2019 bankruptcies) had been somewhat expected, bankruptcy experts and agricultural economists said, as farmers face trade battles, ever-mounting farm debt, prolonged low commodity prices, volatile weather patterns and a fatal pig disease that has decimated China’s herd.
John Newton, chief economist at the Farm Bureau, cited many of the same factors in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin.
""The farm bankruptcies are a function of not only retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture by China, but also years of low commodity prices created by a global economic slowdown and large supplies of grains, oilseeds and livestock products internationally and recent natural disasters,"" Newton said in an email. ""I don’t think you can lay the blame of higher farm bankruptcies on the retaliatory tariffs alone.""
Our ruling
Speaking in Manitowoc, Biden said Trump started a trade war that ""led to a surge in farm bankruptcies.""
The trade wars have indeed hit farmers hard. And bankruptcies rose at the height of the trade wars, increasing more than they had in the four prior years.
But this claim oversimplifies by listing the trade wars alone as being responsible for that increase.

Dr. Drew Pinsky","Are you more likely to die from the flu than coronavirus? It’s complicated




If Your Time is short





Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu.


But, as of now, the flu is more common in the United States than the coronavirus. Both diseases spread similarly and affect similar at-risk groups.


Researchers are still learning more about the severity of the coronavirus. That uncertainty makes it hard to make risk comparisons to other viruses.





See the sources for this fact-check




The 2019 coronavirus has infected more than 113,000 people in 109 countries. But Dr. Drew Pinsky wants the press to focus more on the flu.
In a Feb. 3 segment on Daily Blast Live, a live daytime news and entertainment program, Pinsky, an internist and television personality, lambasted press coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. At the time, more than 17,000 people had been infected, almost all in China.
""The press is overreacting, and it makes me furious,"" he said. ""The press needs to shut up. Because you’re more likely to die of influenza right now.""
Over the following month, the virus spread to 84 other countries, killing thousands of people in the process. But in a follow-up segment March 5, Pinsky doubled down on his comments.
""As I’ve been saying for the last month, what we should be talking about is flu generally,"" he said. ""There’s 16,000 dead, 280,000 hospitalized in this country from influenza. The message should be: Get your flu shot.""
The Feb. 3 video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been repurposed into a meme.

Since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December, we have fact-checked a slew of social media posts and statements that aim to minimize the threat of the 2019 coronavirus. Some of them falsely claim there is a media-run conspiracy to exaggerate the threat of the virus.
Is Dr. Drew, whose own show was canceled in 2016 after he speculated about Hillary Clinton’s health, right to say that the flu poses a bigger threat than the coronavirus? Yes and no.
Coronavirus has a higher mortality rate
Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu. (Several factors apply, such as age and health.)
As of March 10, 4,012 people around the world had died after being infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The death toll in the United States is 28.
A study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the virus from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 80% of the cases were mild, but the virus had a fatality rate of 2.3%. A more recent estimate from the World Health Organization puts the number at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals.
For comparison, the fatality rate of this year’s strain of the flu is estimated to be between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 20,000 and 52,000 have died.
RELATED: Why it’s hard to estimate the coronavirus death rate this early
The higher death count for the flu is a result of its prevalence. As of now, the flu is more common in the United States than the coronavirus. So even though it has a lower mortality rate, it kills more people.

""The prevalence of flu is higher at this moment in time,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""(But) pound for pound, if you had both viruses, the one that’s more likely to make you die is the coronavirus.""
We reached out to Dr. Drew for comment, but we haven’t heard back.
Flu poses a bigger risk — for now
Experts cautioned against minimizing the potential harm of COVID-19.
As of March 10, there were 647 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States. Meanwhile, the CDC estimates that there were between 34 million and 49 million flu illnesses this season.
""For most people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low,"" the CDC says in its risk assessment. ""This virus is not currently widespread in the United States.""
According to the Chinese CDC study, those most likely to die from the coronavirus were older than 60 and/or had preexisting medical conditions, like hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Men were also more likely than women to die. 
Those risk factors are pretty similar to those for the flu. Both diseases also spread similarly: through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes.
RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself
Researchers are still looking into how contagious the 2019 coronavirus is compared with other viruses, at what points it can be transmitted to other people and how common it really is in American communities. That uncertainty makes it hard to draw comparisons between the potential threat of COVID-19 and the current threat of the flu.
""We know a great deal more about transmission of influenza; we know a great deal about who is most likely to become gravely ill; we have drug treatment; we have a vaccine, even if imperfect,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, in an email. ""I think you can see big differences.""
The ways to prevent the spread of both the 2019 coronavirus and the flu are similar: wash your hands, avoid touching your face, disinfect your home and stay away from people who are sick.
""While it may be true that ‘you're more likely to die of influenza right now,’ that is really the wrong way to look at the question,"" said Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist at the University of Vermont’s Division of Immunobiology, in an email. ""It's more important to ask, ‘What will the situation look like three months from now if we do nothing?’""
Part of the current public health response is trying to prevent COVID-19 from becoming an established, regularly occurring illness like the flu. 
Our ruling
Dr. Drew said ""you’re more likely to die of influenza right now"" than the 2019 coronavirus.
The key phrase in this claim is ""right now."" It’s true that, as of March 10, the flu poses a more immediate threat to the American public than the 2019 coronavirus. That’s because it’s currently more widespread; the CDC estimated there were as many as 49 million flu illnesses from October to February, while there have been 647 coronavirus cases in the United States.
But the mortality rate of the flu is lower than that of COVID-19 — the former is estimated to be as high as 0.1%, while the latter is around 3.4% so far. That means you’re more likely to die if you get the coronavirus than if you get the flu, even though you’re less likely to contract COVID-19.

Mandy Cohen","NC health officials clarify number of spoiled COVID-19 vaccines




If Your Time is short




On Jan. 21, North Carolina Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said the number of spoiled vaccines is “very small ... in the tens.”
On Jan. 22, the health department clarified that the exact number of spoiled doses was 1,280 -- about 0.1% of the state's vaccine stock.
Health department officials said Cohen based her press conference comments on conversations she had with rollout leaders.




See the sources for this fact-check




With North Carolina initially among the slower states to administer coronavirus vaccines, reporters are raising questions about the effectiveness of its rollout.
In a press conference on Jan. 21, a reporter asked Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen how many shots had been misused or gone to waste.
""We as a state don’t want to waste any vaccine. We are seeing very small numbers of vaccine waste recorded in our CVMS system, but it’s very few, like in the tens of doses,"" Cohen responded.
Is North Carolina’s spoil number ""very small,"" even ""in the tens?"" 
The state health department says, on average, it’s receiving reports of fewer than 10 spoiled doses per provider. However, the total number of spoiled doses is in the four digits, not two. 
A day after Cohen’s briefing, North Carolina’s health department told the Associated Press that a total of 1,280 doses had been discarded.
About the discrepancy
We asked the department about the comments Cohen made on Thursday. Was she describing the 1,280 number? Had she seen that specific 1,280 figure? 
Chris Mackey, the department’s director of communications, said no.
Cohen hadn’t seen the specific total when she spoke at that Jan. 21 briefing, Mackey said, because the department didn’t run a report on the numbers until later. Cohen based her comments on ""one-off conversations"" with other health officials.
""We ran a report when someone asked us for it. Mandy didn’t have the number,"" Mackey said in a phone interview. ""She was trying to say we haven’t seen any big incidents of vaccine waste.""

The 1,280 spoiled doses account for 0.1% of the 1.1 million doses in the state, the department said in an email. 
There are 250 healthcare providers administering the shots, the email said, meaning the losses average out to about five doses per provider.
Comparing states
It’s difficult to know how North Carolina’s numbers compare with other states.
The CDC has instructed states to report vaccine waste into its tracking system, agency spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told PolitiFact. However, ProPublica reporters found that some states aren’t tracking their spoiled doses.
""We are working to figure out how to provide this data online in the future when the data is more complete,"" Nordlund said.
A 2019 report from the World Health Organization says vaccine waste is expected to be anywhere between 5% and 20% during mass vaccination campaigns. 
There are reports of other states losing hundreds of doses in single incidents.
Wisconsin received national attention when authorities charged a local pharmacist with deliberately destroying around 500 doses of the vaccine.
In Massachusetts, NBC News reported that a Veterans Affairs hospital lost 1,900 doses after a cleaning contractor accidentally unplugged a refrigerator. In Ohio, the Columbus Dispatch reported, a pharmacy spoiled 890 doses by failing to keep them properly stored. In another case, nearly 12,000 doses spoiled on the way to Michigan after the shipping truck got too cold.
Our ruling
Cohen said the health department is receiving reports of ""very small numbers of vaccine waste … but it’s very few, like in the tens of doses."" The health department provided clarity on Cohen’s remarks a day later. 
It’s fair to say the rate of vaccine spoilage is ""very small"" — a tenth of 1%. However, it was inaccurate for Cohen to say the number was ""in the tens."" The total number was 1,280.

Facebook posts","Fact-checking which Trump supporters and allies got PPP loans




If Your Time is short





The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a loan that’s aimed at incentivizing businesses to keep workers on their payroll during the coronavirus pandemic.


The Facebook post correctly characterizes how Kanye West, Jared Kushner’s family and Rep. Roger Williams are connected to companies that received money from that program. 


However, the post oversimplifies how Elaine Chao, Brad Parscale, Betsy DeVos and Devin Nunes benefited.





See the sources for this fact-check




A popular Facebook post claims that some wealthy Republicans and other public figures have benefited from the federal government’s $2 trillion coronavirus relief package.
The post, which was published July 7 by a page called Feminist News, includes a collage of photos depicting eight public figures. It claims that businesses ranging from Kanye West’s apparel company, Yeezy, to ""Devin Nunes’ winery"" have received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program.

""All these millionaires got millions (or close to it) in PPP loans while tens of millions of Americans got a bullsh*t $1200 check months ago,"" reads text in the collage. ""This is how a mafia state works. The small inner circle gets rewarded. Everyone else suffers.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 50,000 times, and other popular liberal pages have published similar posts.

The Paycheck Protection Program is a federal loan initiative to encourage businesses to keep workers on their payrolls during the coronavirus pandemic. The loans are forgivable, meaning some recipients may be able to keep the money. It passed as part of a larger legislative package in late March and was extended by President Donald Trump on July 4. 
Two days later, the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department released a dataset with details about the millions of loans awarded to businesses and nonprofits so far. We used that data to take a closer look at the Facebook post.
The post is correct in saying that some businesses connected to prominent Republicans have received money as part of the program. But in some cases the post oversimplifies their connection to those businesses, and the data do not show that each person personally received ""millions (or close to it).""
Who got what
Some of the Republicans mentioned in the Facebook post directly benefited from PPP loans. Others own stakes in PPP beneficiary companies or have more indirect relationships.
The loan database released by the SBA and the Treasury Department does not specify exactly how much money each entity received. Instead, it offers wide ranges.
We took a look at the database, as well as news reports, to see how each person mentioned in the Facebook post is connected to PPP beneficiaries. (Search the database for yourself here.)
What the post says: ""Kanye West’s company, Yeezy""
Who got the money: Yeezy LLC
Prior to a July 8 interview in which he said he is no longer supporting the president, West was one of Trump’s biggest celebrity supporters. According to the PPP loan database, Yeezy received between $2 million and $5 million.
What the post says: ""Jared Kushner’s family""
Who got the money: Several companies wholly or partially owned by the Kushners
Several companies connected to the family of the president’s son-in-law benefited from the PPP, according to reports from ProPublica and the Daily Beast. 


Observer Holdings LLC, the parent company of Observer Media — which Kushner used to run and is currently owned by his brother-in-law’s investment firm — received between $350,000 and $1 million.


A company called Princeton Forrestal LLC — 40%-owned by Kushner relatives, according to a 2018 securities filing analyzed by the Daily Beast — received between $1 million and $2 million.


Esplanade Livingston LLC, a company connected to the Kushners, received between $350,000 and $1 million.


The Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy in Livingston, N.J., received between $1 million and $2 million. It was named after Kushner’s grandfather and is supported by the family.


Hollwich Kushner Architecture, a firm headed by Marc Kushner, Jared Kushner’s first cousin, received between $150,000 and $350,000.

Chao is the U.S. transportation secretary. A shipping business run by her family benefited from the PPP. The Foremost Group received between $350,000 and $1 million, according to the loan database. Contrary to what the Facebook post says, Chao herself did not receive a loan.
The Foremost Group is not listed on Chao’s 2017 financial disclosure, but her relationship with the company has been the subject of a House of Representatives ethics investigation. The Facebook post notes she is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
What the post says: ""Trump’s campaign manager’s company""
Who got the money: CloudCommerce Inc.
CloudCommerce, a digital marketing company whose largest shareholder is Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager, received between $350,000 and $1 million from the PPP, according to CBS News and the loan database. 
Between 2017 and 2018, CloudCommerce acquired several of Parscale’s companies, and he joined the company’s board of directors. On Dec. 10, 2019, Parscale resigned from the board, but he retained his 34.9% stake in CloudCommerce, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 
As of that date, Parscale was not a ""director, officer, employee or contractor"" of the company, according to the filing. The current chairman and CEO of CloudCommerce is Andrew Van Noy.
Van Noy told CBS that Parscale ""no longer has any involvement in decision-making for the company, including the PPP loan."" Neither Parscale Properties LLC, an investment company that Parscale set up with his family, nor Parscale Strategy LLC, a company that was set up by Parscale and has billed millions to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, has received money from the program.
What the post says: ""Trump’s super PAC""
Who got the money: Companies that have donated to a pro-Trump super PAC
A pro-Trump super PAC did not receive money from the PPP.
Vital Pharmaceuticals, the company that owns Bang Energy, was lent between $5 million and $10 million. In 2019, Vital Pharmaceuticals gave $250,000 to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC that spent $36 million during the 2018 campaign cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Another firm that has donated to the super PAC, G.H. Palmer Associates, received between $350,000 and $1 million, according to the loan database and CNBC.
Companies connected to other major Trump donors were among the earliest recipients of PPP loans, the Associated Press reported.
What the post says: Betsy DeVos
Who got the money: Renaissance Acquisition Co. LLC
The education secretary herself did not receive a loan, but the Facebook post framed it that way. Bloomberg reported that a company with the same name as one listed on her 2017 financial disclosure report did. Renaissance Acquisition Co., which operates an Indianapolis-based company that provides services to nonprofits, received between $2 million and $5 million, according to the loan database.
In her financial disclosure, DeVos reported earning $216,600 as a distributive share from Renaissance Acquisition, meaning she is a partial owner or partner in the business.
What the post says: ""Devin Nunes’ winery""
Who got the money: Phase 2 Cellars LLC and Alpha Omega Winery LLC
Rep. Nunes, R-Calif., is not the sole owner of Phase 2 Cellars, a vineyard in San Luis Obispo that received between $1 million and $2 million from the PPP. But he is a partial owner, holding between $50,001 and $100,000 in equity in it, according to a Daily Beast analysis of Nunes’ most recent financial disclosure. Alpha Omega Winery, another California vineyard in which Nunes holds equity, received a loan within the same range.
What the post says: ""Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas""
Who got the money: JRW Corp.
JRW Corp., a Fort Worth, Texas, car dealership where Williams serves as the sole director and president, was lent between $1 million and $2 million. His own stake in the company exceeds $50 million, according to Williams’ most recent financial disclosure.
We reached out to Feminist News for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
Our ruling
A Facebook post says eight wealthy public figures received loans as part of the federal Paycheck Protection Program.
The post correctly characterizes how West, Kushner and Williams are connected to companies that received money. However, it oversimplifies how Chao, Parscale, DeVos and Nunes benefited from the program. 
The federal government lent millions of dollars to companies connected to, but not wholly owned by, Parscale, Nunes and DeVos. A shipping company owned by Chao’s family received between $350,000 and $1 million, but she did not receive a loan herself, and the company is not listed on her financial disclosure.

Mike Bost","Does the American Rescue Plan limit how states can spend funds?




If Your Time is short




The package allows spending not only on public health but also on the economic impact of the pandemic as well as government services and infrastructure.
But it still contains two big restrictions: the money cannot pay down pensions or fill in holes created by tax cuts.
State and local governments also have to report how they spend the funds, and if they are found in violation must pay the money back.




See the sources for this fact-check




After failing to stop the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package from becoming law, Republicans are blasting the plan as a bailout for poorly managed Democratic states and cities.
A key piece of the criticism has been the stipulation that $350 billion be siphoned off for state and local governments, money Democrats who pushed through the legislation with no Republican support argue will blunt the pandemic’s fiscal fallout.
Rep. Mike Bost, a Republican from Murphysboro in southwestern Illinois, joined the national GOP chorus when in a WJPF radio interview he claimed there was nothing in the legislation limiting how states can spend the money.
""Where are the checks and balances in the issuing of these funds? Where is it that in there it says, it can only be used for A, B, C and D? It does not,"" Bost said. ""And that’s the problem.""
The law — dubbed the ""American Rescue Plan"" by President Joe Biden — is more flexible than previous aid packages in how money can be spent, experts told us. But it’s also not a free-for-all.
More leeway, but some limits
A relief bill passed last year, when Republicans controlled the White House and the U.S. Congress, earmarked $150 billion in state and local government aid for expenses tied only to the public health emergency. After last year’s law — dubbed the CARES Act — took effect, guidance from the federal Department of the Treasury explained funds could go beyond direct health care spending to cover items such as payroll for first responders and costs associated with caring for the homeless community.
The text of the latest aid package sets more flexible guidelines, allowing state and local governments to spend on the pandemic’s ""negative economic impacts."" According to the language of the new law, funds can go toward increased pay for essential workers, preventing cuts to government services, and making investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure as well. And unlike the 2020 CARES Act, it covers costs incurred through 2024.
Bost spokesperson Alex Naughton, responding to our inquiry in an email, said the Democrats’ package lacks ""any meaningful guardrails"" for how state and local governments can spend the funds.
""They so loosely defined the terms of what’s an acceptable use of funds … that literally almost any expense could qualify,"" Naughton said. ""This effectively creates a slush fund to use on whatever they want, as long as they paste a ‘pandemic response’ label on the package first.""
Experts agreed the new law provides considerable leeway, but they added that it does set some limits and outlines penalties for states and municipalities if they go beyond the legislation’s parameters.

Specifically, state and local governments can’t use funds to make pension payments or offset lost revenue from state and local tax cuts enacted since March 3, 2021.
In Illinois, the pension fund prohibition is particularly relevant given the state’s struggle to meet its pension obligations. Last April, Democratic state Senate President Don Harmon attracted national media coverage when he sent a letter to Illinois’ congressional delegation requesting $10 billion to help shore up the underfunded pension funds.
The prohibition on direct pension spending doesn’t rule out the possibility the federal aid could free up other state money to shift toward pensions. Audit provisions in the law, however, spell out how states would have to return the money if they violate the spending restrictions.
""If something is found to be outside the scope of the program, the [state or local] government's on the hook to pay that back,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago’s College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs.
Our ruling
Bost said the American Rescue Plan ""does not"" include ""checks and balances"" on how state and local government funds can be spent.
Experts agreed the package is more permissive than previous state and local relief. It allows spending not only on public health but also on the economic impact of the pandemic as well as government services and infrastructure.
But it still contains two big restrictions: the money cannot pay down pensions or fill in holes created by tax cuts. State and local governments also have to report how they spend the funds, and if they are found in violation must pay the money back.

Ted Budd","Budd says 9% of stimulus targets COVID, the rest is 'not even' related




If Your Time is short




It's accurate to say that less than 9% of the American Rescue Plan funds activities meant to directly combat the virus itself.
However, that doesn't mean the rest of the bill isn't COVID-related.
While the definition of ""COVID-related"" is squishy, it's fair to say that the extension of unemployment benefits and funding for school reopenings are related to the pandemic.




See the sources for this fact-check




A North Carolina congressman claims the Democrats’ proposed stimulus plan has very little to do with the coronavirus.
The ""American Rescue Plan"" calls for $1.9 trillion in spending. 
""There’s about 9% of it actually going to COVID, meaning 91% of it is not even COVID-related,"" Republican. Rep. Ted Budd said in a speech, which he tweeted.
Is Budd right about those percentages?
The first part of Budd’s quote is accurate. Expert analysis shows a small percentage of the spending is directed at combating the virus through vaccines, protective equipment or resources for health care providers.
But that doesn’t mean the rest of the bill isn’t related to COVID-19. A significant percentage of the bill aims to address the financial fallout caused by the pandemic.
Combatting COVID
Experts we spoke with put the bill’s spending into three categories: coronavirus containment, things that are tightly or loosely related to the pandemic, and things that shouldn’t be considered related at all.
Let’s look first at spending that directly targets COVID-containment. Depending on how COVID-containment is measured, the cost ranges between $100 billion and $160 billion. 
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group focused on reducing federal deficits, put COVID-19 ""containment"" efforts at $110 billion, or 6% of the bill. The group put vaccine-related activities in a separate group costing about $17 billion, less than 1% of the entire bill. 
For his part, President Joe Biden said $160 billion would go towards COVID-19 testing, protective gear, vaccine production and distribution. Even if we take this higher number, that would mean the funds directed to fight COVID account for roughly 8.4% of the $1.9 trillion. 
That means the first part of Budd’s claim is nearly spot-on.
What’s COVID-related?
But the second part of his claim is off-base. While a lot of the proposed spending doesn’t directly go toward combating COVID, that doesn’t mean it’s not related to the coronavirus. 
A significant portion is designed to offer economic relief to businesses and people affected by the pandemic.

Perhaps the most famous part of the plan, direct stimulus payments to individuals, is estimated to cost more than $420 billion. The plan would also extend unemployment benefits and offer financial aid to help schools reopen. 
Erica York at the Tax Foundation and Stan Veuger at the American Enterprise Institute both described economic relief efforts as ""COVID-related.""
""Whether you think they’re wise or not, they’re clearly a response to the economic crisis,"" Veuger said in a phone interview.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported that $246 billion would go toward extending unemployment benefits through August and raising the federal supplement payment — a move that would account for roughly 13% of the budget. The Congressional Budget Office also said the proposed unemployment benefits would cost $246 billion. The unemployment benefits, combined with a $400-a-week supplement to state unemployment insurance payments, would cost a combined $350 billion, PolitiFact reported.
The CRFB reported that $130 billion, or 7%, would go toward helping schools reopen safely.
We asked Budd whether he believes the extension of unemployment benefits is unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis. Spokesman Curtis Kalin didn’t directly answer the question. He said Budd wants to reopen the country. For aid, he said the federal government could use the $1 trillion that hasn’t been spent yet — a claim we’ve rated Half True.
Not COVID-related
To be clear, the bill does include proposals that experts don’t necessarily see as pertinent.
""The Democratic proposal is going beyond what we’ve seen in past relief measures by significantly expanding existing tax credits and making changes to the international tax system,"" York said. 
""For instance, lawmakers are proposing expanding the child tax credit,"" she said. ""Opponents might argue that’s wish list and isn’t a speedy form of relief, but proponents might argue it’s COVID-related because the pandemic and downturn have disproportionately affected lower-income households and so policies are being targeted toward the affected populations.""
In total, the CRFB estimates the House Democrats’ relief package includes ""at least $312 billion of policies that have little to do with the current crisis."" The group cited the $110 billion to expand the Child Tax Credit and $50 billion to expand health care access through the Affordable Care Act.
The CRFB proposed alternative plans costing $1.3 trillion and $1.1 trillion, respectively. Meanwhile, a group of Republican senators proposed a $600 billion plan. 
Our ruling
Budd said about 9% of Biden’s stimulus plan ""is actually going to COVID, meaning 91% of it is not even COVID-related.""
In the first part of his statement, Budd accurately describes the proposed spending on efforts to combat the virus itself. 
However, he’s wrong to suggest the rest of the bill isn’t related to COVID-19 at all. He may disagree with how much the bill would spend on unemployment insurance and other financial relief efforts. But the bill does aim to address the financial cost of the pandemic.

Steve Scalise","Has $1 trillion in COVID-19 relief gone unspent?




If Your Time is short





About $1 trillion remains to be disbursed, but a large share of it has been allocated or is scheduled to be spent.


Most of the unspent money was approved in late December, and it takes time to distribute it.


As the economy recovers, some of the money might not be spent.





See the sources for this fact-check




House Democrats are forging ahead with a vote on a $1.9 trillion package to address the coronavirus and fix the economic damage that cost about 10 million people their jobs. Rep. Steve Scalise, second in command of the House Republicans, said that he and his colleagues support spending more to overcome the pandemic, but that the Democratic plan is chock full of unneeded giveaways.
""There's over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous relief bills that were bipartisan,"" Scalise, R-La., said Feb. 21 on ABC’s This Week. ""The money's still sitting in a bank account and we're going to pass $1.9 trillion of additional spending to bail out failed states, to raise the minimum wage? What does that have to do with COVID?""
The claim that there is $1 trillion left over from earlier efforts is a top Republican talking point. Scalise led with the same argument in a Feb. 19 op-ed.
His source is the COVID Money Tracker, a project of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group focused on reducing federal deficits. The tracker’s latest number shows that out of $4.1 trillion approved by Congress, about $3 trillion has been committed or disbursed.
But in a Jan. 27 blog post, the budget group warned that figuring out how much money remains is complicated. It’s not, they wrote, as though the money is ""sitting in budget accounts waiting to be allocated."" 
""Much of it is already allocated or scheduled to be spent, and a small portion will never be spent,"" they wrote.
A large fraction of the nominally unspent money comes from the Response and Relief Act, passed in late December. 
""These funds will take some time to disburse and even more time to appear in the data,"" they said. 
About a fifth of the money that Scalise counted will be spent over several years, primarily in the form of Medicaid dollars and a lending program called Economic Injury and Disaster Loans.
Part of the uncertainty, the committee’s analysts wrote, is that some of the money allocated in earlier bills might never be spent. For example, the CARES Act that passed in March extended unemployment benefits at an estimated cost of $250 billion. But as of right now, that seems to overshoot the need, they said. The amount of the excess would make Scalise’s $1 trillion number a bit lower.

Setting aside the December relief package, about 80% of previously allocated funds have been spent, they said.
The federal government has its own COVID-19 relief spending tracker. It counts dollars differently than the one Scalise used, and it hasn’t been updated since the end of December. By its accounting, out of a total of $2.4 trillion that Congress approved, about $500 billion remains unspent and unobligated. 
If federal dollars go unspent, that might suggest that certain programs need to be redesigned. Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings, a Washington research group, said it could be that the way Congress set up a program made it too hard for the money to get to the people and businesses that needed help.
That, however, is a separate question from the size of the relief bill.
""Ultimately, it may be the case that unspent funds mean that the next package should be smaller, but I don’t think that’s the first conclusion one should necessarily draw from any existence of unspent funds,"" Reynolds said.
Even money that Washington has disbursed can be held up at the state level. Massachusetts has spent about half of the $2.7 billion it got through the CARES Act, the Boston Globe reported. Missouri officials left about $13 million for small farms and businesses unused.
Our ruling
Scalise said, ""There's over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous relief bills ... still sitting in a bank account.""
Scalise’s point-in-time figure is in line with one running tally, but he oversimplified the status of the funds. A large share of the total is already allocated or scheduled to be spent. A key factor is that Washington is getting up to speed in disbursing funds approved in late December.
The money is not sitting in budget accounts, but neither has it reached its final destination..

The committee overseeing Wisconsin’s vaccine rollout on Jan. 12, 2021 in a draft document initially recommended a plan that would deliver vaccine shots to people 70 and older regardless of their occupation or health condition in the next phase -- 1B-- of distribution.


The second phase plan also included teachers and child care providers, firefighters and police officers, health care workers who don't treat COVID-19 patients and mink farmers due to the high risk of COVID-19 outbreaks among mink.


The panel also recommended including people in shared housing facilities, like prisons — sparking outrage among some Republican lawmakers.


On Jan. 19, 2021, the state Department of Health Services in a news release announced those 65 and older would be eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations.


The vaccine committee did not send its recommendations for the next group to be eligible to DHS, which included congregate living settings and incarcerated individuals, until Jan. 21, 2021.


People age 65 and up are now receiving vaccinations. Incarcerated persons will not be eligible for vaccination until March 1

Now that the dust has cleared a bit, we wanted to go back and examine what was a common theme, especially among Republicans. That is, that prison inmates should not be near the top of the list.
For instance, on Jan. 12, 2021, when a document containing recommendations from a state committee was released, state Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, tweeted: 
""The committee that advises @GovEvers and his department tasked with leading during this pandemic is recommending allowing prisoners to receive the vaccine before 65 year old grandma?"" 
Is it true that a state committee recommended providing inmates with COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the state’s elderly? 
Who falls where in line?
At issue here is where various groups fall on the priority list for the distribution of limited COVID vaccines. It’s up to each state to establish its own list, though most started with front-line health care workers and nursing home residents.
Republicans pushed a bill that would make the vaccine available to anyone in the state that wants it by mid-March and bar Gov. Tony Evers and his administration from prioritizing prisoners in any way as they set priorities.
Health officials say there are many reasons for putting inmates near the top of the list, including the fact prisons have been the site of deadly outbreaks and because the state -- and its taxpayers -- have a legal obligation to assure inmates receive adequate health care. If they do not, taxpayers could be on the hook for lawsuits over unfair or inadequate treatment.
In any case, in Wisconsin, the committee group charged with providing advice on the vaccine priority list is the Vaccine Distribution Subcommittee of the Wisconsin State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee.
Its aim is to provide the best advice from a medical perspective, not taking into account political considerations. Its advice is also just that -- advice. The group does not have the final say in the matter. The panel collects public input on who should be prioritized in the rollout, and gives recommendations to the state Department of Health Services on how to manage each phase of the distribution. 
When asked to provide backup for Born’s claim, his office pointed to a document released by the advisory committee on Jan. 12, 2021 -- the same day of the tweet.
That document noted: ""Current supplies of vaccine limit the ability to provide vaccine to all who wish to be vaccinated; therefore, rationing of available vaccine will be necessary until production and distribution increases to amounts sufficient to meet all needs."" 
At the time, the group was looking past health-care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities -- Priority 1A -- and was offering guidance for the next group, Priority 1B.
The group recommended vaccines be available for anyone 70 or older, noting ""the evidence of deaths in that group in Wisconsin, where 71% of deaths and hospitalization are in those 70 and above.""

By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







It also called for including staff and residents in what are termed ""congregate living facilities."" That category includes homeless shelters, group homes and -- yes -- correctional facilities. 
It should be noted, the recommendation was not simply to immunize inmates in the 1B group, but also correctional workers, since the virus can be passed between individuals, and even move into a prison from the community via staff members coming to work.
This is a good place to pause and note two things:
First, our ratings are based on the information known at the time. It’s impossible for people to predict the future and, indeed, things changed after the recommendation was made. Ultimately, the state reduced the age guidelines for the general population in group 1B to 65 and older.
Second, it was subtle, but Born’s tweet mentioned two groups: Not only the advisory committee, but the ""department tasked with leading during this pandemic."" That would be the Department of Health Services. The tweet said both were recommending inmates come before ""65 year old Grandma.""
Another piece of the puzzle
That’s where the claim runs into a problem.
First, the document produced by the advisory committee -- and provided to us by Born’s office as backup -- includes this label: ""Draft -- for discussion only."" 
While the committee was recommending that ""congregate facilities"" be included in Priority 1B, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Jan. 14, 2021, but according to Department of Health Services spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt, the panel did not submit its recommendations to the department until Jan. 21, and they were not accepted until Jan. 25.
""You’ll also note the eligibility groups are listed in priority order— congregate living settings are the last eligibility group listed for priority group 1B, after education and childcare, public facing essential workers, among others,"" Goodsitt wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.
Another piece of information arguing against the idea the department itself backed the inmates-before-Grandma approach, is that on Jan. 19, DHS announced those 65 and older -- not 70 and older as the panel suggested -- would be eligible for vaccinations starting Jan. 25. 
What’s more, even now, a month later, congregate living facilities are not yet eligible.
The next phase, which includes teachers, grocers, and anyone living in shared housing such as prisons, among other groups, is to begin March 1.  
Our ruling
Born tweeted ""The committee that advises @GovEvers and his department tasked with leading during this pandemic is recommending allowing prisoners to receive the vaccine before 65 year old grandma?"" 
The panel did draw its line for Phase 1B at 70 year olds and included those in ""congregate living facilities"" -- a group that includes prison inmates. But the recommendations were not sent to the full department until days later. By that time, the department had lowered the age threshold to 65, and started that group before prisons.
It’s unclear if blowback to the idea of inmates-before-Grandma prompted the department to take a different approach, as Republicans argue. But it is clear the department had not taken a public position at the time.

Coronavirus







Donald Trump","Trump oversells crediting White House response for falling COVID-19 fatality statistic




If Your Time is short



• There was a major decline in the case-fatality rate — the number of coronavirus deaths divided by known cases — compared to an earlier phase in the epidemic. However, “groundbreaking therapies” are only part of the reason. 
• One factor in a lower case-fatality rate is the huge increase in coronavirus testing. In the first weeks and months of the outbreak, testing focused on those who were more seriously ill, including nursing home residents. That kept the case-fatality rate high.
• By the time Operation Warp Speed had announced its scope and leadership, most of the decline in the case-fatality rate had already occurred.



See the sources for this fact-check




Seeking to counter the notion that the United States has failed to make progress against the  novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump offered a positive statistic during a Sep. 7 news conference.
""Under Operation Warp Speed, we’ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April,"" Trump said. ""You don’t hear that from the press very often.  They don’t like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85% — think of that — since April.""
When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, they provided the following chart, which they said was compiled by Stanford University School of Medicine professor Jay Bhattacharya. The time frame is somewhat different from what Trump cited, but the trend line is roughly the same.

The chart shows the case-fatality rate for coronavirus between mid-March and mid-July. That statistic refers to the number of coronavirus deaths divided by the number of known coronavirus cases — effectively, the likelihood that you will die from coronavirus if you are known to have been infected. (The data adjusts for the typical lag time between infection and death by pairing the infection data with the death data from two weeks later.)
According to the White House’s chart, close to one-third of people who were infected in mid-March ended up dying from the virus. By late April, that rate had fallen to 5%. That’s roughly an 85% decline. (The statistic does not take into account specific risk factors for the disease that an individual may have, and instead looks at the population as a whole. So a person with risk factors may have a greater likelihood of dying, while one without risk factors would have a smaller likelihood.)
Bhattacharya told PolitiFact that the chart shows ""a very sharp drop in the case fatality rate from COVID-19 infection in the U.S. since the beginning of the epidemic — people are more likely to survive after infection than they were. It seems very important to me for the public to understand that the lethality of the infection is not what it was when impressions first formed in March. The experience of the Northeast with the epidemic in those early days is atypical of the experience of people infected now.""
However, Trump’s focus on this one data point also needs some additional context. The reasons for the drop are not entirely from improved therapies, and Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s effort to devise countermeasures against the virus, doesn’t necessarily get the credit for the drop.
Why did the case fatality rate fall?
Part of the decline likely stems from reasons other than better treatments, said Tara C. Smith, a professor of Epidemiology at Kent State University’s College of Public Health.
One factor is testing. Early on, due in part to shortages in testing equipment, only individuals with significant symptoms were being tested, and those patients would be likelier to end up with a fatal case. Later on, Smith said, testing was catching more individuals with mild symptoms or even no symptoms at all, which helped decrease the case-fatality rate.
To make this concrete, in March 19, as the case-fatality rate was peaking, 27,974 tests were taken nationally, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. By April 27, the number was 196,080 — a seven-fold increase. By then, the case-fatality rate had fallen significantly. The rate fell further by July 22, when the number of tests had risen to 796,439.
""Since the denominator of case-fatality is the number of cases detected, the availability of testing and testing practices is a huge driver of the case fatality,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.
It is worth noting that the Trump administration has touted its role in expanded testing. But had the same level of testing been in place earlier in the epidemic, the figures on this chart may not have shown the same level of fatality rate decline.
In addition, the coronavirus was especially deadly to residents in nursing homes early in the pandemic. That coincided with the period of when testing was limited, probably exaggerating the case-fatality rate. Later in the pandemic, nursing homes implemented stronger protections.

By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







Better treatments have helped as well, experts said, including improvements from trial and error in how to treat hospitalized patients, and from additional knowledge gained about what had been an entirely unknown virus just months earlier. The White House told PolitiFact that it considers such improvements the key to the U.S. having a better case-fatality ratio than some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Italy, and France.
Sometimes these improvements have stemmed from things like ventilator use or better positioning of patients on their hospital bed.
In other cases, they have come from the use of drugs, such as an existing steroid known as dexamethasone and experimental drugs such as remdesivir, Bhattacharya said. ""Teasing apart exactly how much each treatment advance has mattered is still the subject of scientific work,"" he said.
Smith said she expects pharmaceutical advances to eventually be shown to be ""a much smaller piece of the pie"" than the other factors, such as the scope of testing and the age range of those likely to be tested.
Meanwhile, it’s doubtful that Operation Warp Speed played much of a role in the decline Trump was referencing. The administration-designed effort, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, does focus to an extent on therapeutics, but its primary goal is to deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective vaccine by January 2021.
More to the point, Operation Warp Speed only announced its scope and leadership on May 15, and by that time, the case-fatality rate had already fallen most of the way from its peak.
Finally, it’s worth noting that case-fatality rate is not the only relevant statistic — and many of the other ones are less flattering to the administration.
Here’s a chart comparing the decline of the case-fatality rate against daily deaths from coronavirus. (The data we used, from the COVID Tracking Project, was different than what was used in the White House chart, but it shows the same overall pattern.)

 
As the chart shows, having a low case-fatality rate is no guarantee of protection against a surge in deaths. Even though the case fatality rate has been lower than ever in recent weeks, deaths have settled into roughly 1,000 a day, far more daily deaths than when the case-fatality rate was much higher.
Our ruling
Trump said, ""Under Operation Warp Speed, we’ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April.""
The decline in the case-fatality rate from an earlier phase in the epidemic is real and notable, but ""groundbreaking therapies"" are only part of the reason. 
When the rate was peaking, it was a period when relatively few Americans were being tested, and when a sizable percentage of those being tested were those who were more seriously ill, including nursing home residents.
In the meantime, by the time Operation Warp Speed had announced its scope and leadership, most of the decline in the case-fatality rate had already occurred.

Lori Lightfoot","Has Illinois fallen behind other states in testing for the coronavirus?




If Your Time is short





Data show that while Illinois’ testing rate for COVID-19 falls below average nationally, the state is outpacing those that surround it.





See the sources for this fact-check




The U.S. still lags behind a number of other countries in the share of its population that’s been tested for COVID-19. But how do individual states within the U.S. compare with one another?
That’s a subject Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised at a news conference while highlighting the need for increased testing capacity in Illinois to respond to the outbreak.
""Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing because of the availability,"" Lightfoot said on April 7. ""It’s not for lack of desire, it’s for lack of the tests themselves, the reagents, some of the other materials that we need to be able to process the tests.""
Illinois, like many states, has struggled to expand testing due to the national shortage of tests and other supplies. And while the numbers are improving, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the state is still falling short of the goal he set for performing 10,000 tests per day. In an interview aired on April 14, the governor said the state is now conducting almost 8,000.
But Illinois is not unique in the testing challenges it is facing, so we wondered whether the state was really as far behind as Lightfoot suggested.
In response to our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office acknowledged testing figures have improved somewhat from several weeks ago, but provided a March 27 report from ABC 7 that found more than half of all states had done more testing than Illinois had after accounting for population size, including neighboring Wisconsin.
Those results were based on data from March 26 — almost two weeks before the mayor made her comparison. Given how rapidly testing data are fluctuating, we decided to evaluate her claim based on more recent figures.
To do that, we turned to data from the COVID Tracking Project, a source Lightfoot’s office pointed to in a later response.
The project, which is managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, gathers data from state health departments around the country and provides figures on the total number of tests conducted by both public and commercial labs.

Its database shows Lightfoot was partly right and partly wrong when she said Illinois was testing at a rate that put it behind all its neighbors as well as in the ""bottom tier"" nationwide.
The day Lightfoot made her claim, Illinois ranked 28 out of all 50 states for testing on a per capita basis, figures from the project show. Its ranking has improved only slightly in the time since, with the state coming in 24th as of April 14. Its current tally of just over 110,600 total tests comes out to about 8,730 tests per million residents. New York, which tops the list, has run more than 25,650 tests per million.
But Lightfoot’s Illinois comparison doesn’t hold when it comes to the states it borders. On the day she made her claim, Illinois came out slightly ahead of Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Iowa. And in the days since, its lead has continued to grow.
Given how frequently testing figures change — along with differences in the ways states report their data — that lead in the Midwest may not mean much. But it’s enough to show Lightfoot is incorrect in her assertion that Illinois is trailing the region.
Our ruling
Lightfoot said, ""Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing.""
At the time Lightfoot made her statement, Illinois did lag a majority of states nationally in terms of the share of its population that had been tested for COVID-19, according to data compiled by an independent reporting project.
But the same dataset shows Illinois tested — and continues to test — more residents per capita than the states it borders.

Montanans would still be eligible for state unemployment benefits, just not the federal enhancement. With the federal program still in place, unemployed Montanans were eligible for between $451 and $810 per week in benefits. In June, when Montana is scheduled to leave the program, weekly benefits are set to fall to between $151 and $510 per week.

As part of the CARES Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in March 2020, the federal government approved $600 in additional weekly benefits for unemployed workers on top of state unemployment benefits. After that benefit expired in July, it was replaced by $300 weekly payments included in another relief package in December. The American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion package that  President Joe Biden signed in March 2021, extended those benefits through Labor Day. 
Gianforte cast his plan to leave the federal program as an attempt to combat a state labor shortage. ""Montana is open for business again, but I hear from too many employers throughout our state who can’t find workers. Nearly every sector in our economy faces a labor shortage,"" he said in a statement. 
Withdrawing from the federal program is one of two measures that Gianforte announced in May to spur hiring. The second is the launch of a return-to-work program that will grant previously unemployed Montanans a $1,200 bonus if they remain steadily employed for at least a month. The return-to-work bonus will be federally funded by the American Rescue Plan. 
Montana is the first state to announce plans to leave the federal unemployment program. A few days later, South Carolina became the second, with Gov. Henry McMaster scheduling a withdrawal from the program by June 30.

Coronavirus







Ron DeSantis","Is Florida doing better on COVID-19 than 'locked down' states?




If Your Time is short



• Currently, Florida has relatively low rates of coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations. However, the connection between this and Florida’s light regulation of businesses’ and residents’ behavior is less clear-cut than DeSantis suggests.
• Only about half of the 10 most stringently regulated states saw rates of cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Florida’s, which was DeSantis’ benchmark.
• Numerous other states that followed similarly low-regulation policies are seeing coronavirus statistics far worse than Florida’s. This means Florida’s lower infection numbers could be related to factors other than behavioral regulations, such as its warmer weather.



See the sources for this fact-check




Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted pleas from some of his state’s mayors to enact statewide measures to fight COVID-19, such as a mask mandate and the power to adopt local restrictions.
The day before Florida recorded its 1 millionth case, DeSantis told reporters that states in lockdown mode are faring worse than Florida.
""So I hear people say, ‘Oh, well, Florida is open, and they’re having increased cases,’"" DeSantis said Nov. 30. ""Well, OK, the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are. If you look at the per capita cases, in a lot of these states that have closed schools, businesses shuttered, some of them even post stay-at-home orders there, you see a huge increase in these cases.""
We checked DeSantis’ claim that ""the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are."" We found that while Florida is doing comparatively well at the moment, DeSantis overstated the correlation between cases and lockdown rules. It’s likely that other factors beyond just a state’s rules are affecting COVID-19 rates.
The state of lockdowns nationwide
In an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, states have enacted — and then sometimes relaxed or lifted — various restrictions, including mask mandates, limits on restaurant capacity, and bans on large gatherings.
DeSantis, a Republican, issued an order Sept. 25 that generally lifted restrictions on businesses and suspended fines for people who didn’t comply. While many stores and restaurants have adopted their own mask and social distancing rules, Floridians have still packed into some bars and other gathering spots. 
In November, cases in Florida were on the rise, but unlike some other governors, DeSantis said he wouldn’t issue new mandates.
Reviewing the evidence
We asked Fred Piccolo, a spokesperson for DeSantis, for evidence to explain the governor’s claim that cases in states that are locked down are increasing twice as fast as in Florida.
Piccolo cited a New York Times state-by-state analysis, updated Nov. 30, showing which states have businesses that are mostly closed, which ones have no restrictions, and which ones are ""mixed."" The Times also published a map showing states with stay-at-home orders or advisories.
Piccolo then used the Covid Act Now website to calculate the number of cases and hospitalizations per 100,000 residents in some of the states with more stringent restrictions.
We checked the numbers ourselves. We focused on the states that the Times had cited as enacting the most stringent restrictions for either businesses or residents as of Nov. 30, as well as the states that had a medium level of restrictions on both businesses and residents. All told, 10 states qualified for this group of states with high coronavirus-related restrictions. (Our list of 10 states was slightly different from the one Piccolo provided, but not substantively so.)
Broadly speaking, we found that Florida’s record, at least as of the beginning of December, compared favorably with most states across the country, including those with tighter restrictions. Specifically, in comparisons of coronavirus cases deaths and hospitalizations per capita, Florida ranked among the best, and better than some of the more highly regulated states. (Click on the chart to see separate comparisons for cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.)

 
So there’s something to what DeSantis said. However, there are also some important caveats.
First, some of the more highly regulated states performed better than Florida did. For instance, Oregon, Washington state and California had fewer coronavirus deaths per capita than Florida did, while Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington state had lower hospitalization rates.
Second, DeSantis’ reference to ""twice the rate"" undercuts the strength of his argument. Out of the 10 states with the most stringent rules, only about half had per capita cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Florida’s rate.
Third, Florida may be faring better than many other states in fighting the coronavirus, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that a lack of restrictions is to credit for better coronavirus statistics.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The following chart shows 27 states, including Florida, that the New York Times’ analysis found to have the least restrictive COVID-19 rules on businesses and residents. 

 
Once again, Florida ranks well compared with the other states on cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But many of the states that followed similarly  low levels of restrictions as Florida did ended up with far worse outcomes. 
We found that 12 of the low-restriction states had double Florida’s case rate, eight had double the rate of deaths, and nine had double the rate of hospitalizations. Five states had double Florida’s rate in each of the three statistics — South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, and Indiana — and another five states had twice Florida’s rate for two statistics. 
RELATED: In Nebraska, skyrocketing cases of COVID-19 put localities, governor on separate tracks
It’s also important to note that some states added or tightened restrictions in November, making the impact so far difficult to evaluate.
Why might Florida be doing relatively well?
The comparison with other lightly regulated states suggests that Florida may be doing relatively well for reasons other than its low-regulation policy.
For example, Florida’s weather makes it easier for residents to eat and gather outdoors, even at this time of year. Scientists have generally said that the virus passes from person to person less easily outdoors than in cramped indoor spaces.
""I think it’s reasonable to say that the warmer weather certainly plays a part in Florida’s relative success,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. ""It’s no longer incredibly hot, necessitating indoor gathering for air conditioning, but not too cold that people need to congregate indoors for heat.""
In addition, it’s hard to establish causation: Is it the loose regulation that helps reduce infection rates, or is it the low infection rates that allow for looser regulations? 
Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county, had an increase in cases following the removal of the mitigation strategies, said Mary Jo Trepka, chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Florida International University.
""We don’t know how bad it will get,"" Trepka said.
It’s also important to remember that states aren’t walled-off jurisdictions. During much of the pandemic, Florida has been open to tourists, which means we don’t know whether coronavirus transmission within Florida is increasing infections in other states after those tourists return home, said Marissa Levine, a public health professor at the University of South Florida.
Jason L. Salemi, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida, cautions that the success DeSantis claimed is only in comparison with other states, and that cases and hospitalizations have been rising over the last few weeks. ""That, to me, is indicative of how serious the situation is across the country,"" he said.
Our ruling
DeSantis said, ""The states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are"" in Florida.
Currently, Florida does have relatively low rates of coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But the connection between those statistics and Florida’s light restrictions on businesses and residents is less clear-cut than DeSantis suggests.
Only about half of the 10 most stringently regulated states saw rates of cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Florida’s — DeSantis’ benchmark.
Meanwhile, numerous other states that followed the same less restrictive policies as Florida have fared far worse than Florida. This suggests that factors other than behavioral regulations, such as warm weather, may play a role in keeping coronavirus infections relatively low in Florida.

Mandy Cohen","Is COVID-19 America's leading cause of death?




If Your Time is short




North Carolina health secretary Mandy Cohen said ""Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States.""
When it comes to deaths per day, Cohen has a point.
In the bigger picture, the CDC says heart disease and cancer are still the leading causes of death.




See the sources for this fact-check




With North Carolina in the middle of a stay-at-home order, the state’s top health official tried to emphasize the severity of COVID-19.
The novel coronavirus has killed more than 200 people in North Carolina and reached 93 of North Carolina’s 100 counties, according to the NC Department of Health and Human Services.
On top of that, health secretary Mandy Cohen on April 20 said the virus has reached a new status among other illnesses in America.
""Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States,"" Cohen said.
Is that true?
If you look at average daily deaths, yes. If you look at the bigger picture, no.
Recent deaths
If you look for the answer to this question online, you’ll likely get mixed results.
Several media outlets -- such as Live Science, Newsweek and others -- recently reported that coronavirus is the top cause of death in America. But those claims look at death rates in a very small window, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control tend to label diseases based on their toll in a given year. 
Live Science and Newsweek based their claims on a chart created by Dr. Maria Danilychev, who practices at Scripps Health in San Diego. Her chart takes the number of COVID-19 deaths in America as reported by Worldometer.com. Then it compares the deaths to the average daily deaths from other illnesses as reported by the CDC.
For instance, if you look at the number of total deaths caused by heart disease reported in 2018 (647,457) and divide that by 365 (the number of days in a year) you get about 1,774 deaths per day. On April 20, Worldometer reported 1,939 coronavirus deaths across the U.S.
Cohen’s office told PolitiFact that she also based her claim on how daily coronavirus deaths compare to past heart disease death averages. In an email to PolitiFact, DHHS spokeswoman Tracy Zimmerman cited the 30-day rolling average for COVID-19 deaths as documented on OurWorldInData.com.

Over the phone, Zimmerman added that Cohen didn’t mean for her comment to be taken as a broad statement about historical death trends.
Deaths by year
At the CDC, experts tend to look at a bigger picture when classifying something as a top cause of death.
In fact, a spokesman for the National Center for Health Statistics has pushed back at the idea that COVID-19 is the leading cause of death.
""There are no data to support that theory,"" Jeff Lancashire, a spokesperson for the National Center for Health Statistics, said in an email to CNN on April 10.
""We have limited data on 2020 deaths by cause, and no final official numbers yet for 2019, but we do know by looking at the final death totals in 2018 for the two leading causes of death in the U.S., Heart Disease and Cancer, there is no way that at this point COVID-19 comes anywhere close to those totals,"" Lancashire said.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The State newspaper in Columbia, S.C. have used Lancashire’s comments to add context to claims about coronavirus.
PolitiFact emailed the CDC on Tuesday to ask if its opinion had changed. ""Not really,"" CDC spokesman Brian Tsai said in an email.
""One can argue that for some weeks, it is the leading cause for those particular weeks, but we typically talk about leading causes in terms of annual deaths,"" the spokesman said.  
""When looking at the data year-to-date (i.e., January-April), COVID-19 wouldn’t be the leading cause. In a typical year, there are more than 200,000 heart disease deaths from January-April. For cancer, the number is a little less than 200,000 for that period.
By contrast, when Cohen made her claim on April 20, the CDC reported coronavirus deaths at 39,000.
Our ruling
Cohen said ""Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States."" 
That’s true only if you compare the number of people dying of coronavirus daily against estimates of other causes from previous years. The CDC has advised against using those daily numbers to make sweeping claims about the biggest causes of death in America.

Coronavirus







Joe Biden","Why it’s hard to link school reopenings to Biden’s efforts




If Your Time is short





If schools had adhered to school reopening guidelines issued by the CDC in February, many districts would have shuttered schools.


Biden called for prioritizing educators for vaccines on March 2. By that date, more than 30 states already offered priority for teachers.


The American Rescue Plan includes school funding, though much of it will be spent after 2021.


Myriad factors have gone into school reopening decisions by local and state officials, including declining COVID-19 cases and increased vaccinations.
 





See the sources for this fact-check




President Joe Biden took some credit for school reopenings, tying increases in in-person learning to his administration’s efforts to vaccinate educators and send money to schools.
""Back in February, when many of our schools were fully or partially closed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the CDC — issued guidelines to help reopen our schools safely,"" Biden said April 21. ""Then, in March, Congress approved the American Rescue Plan to fund the safe reopening of our schools.""
But educators were anxious about going back to the classroom without being vaccinated and many parents were nervous about sending their children, Biden said. 
""So, on March the 2nd, I launched a program directing all states to make educators, school staff, school bus drivers, child care workers eligible for vaccination in every state so that schools and child care centers could open with a peace of mind,"" Biden said. ""Within a month, 80% had received at least one shot, and schools and child care centers all over the country are reopening."" 
It’s true that more schools have reopened from COVID-19-era closures in Biden’s first 100 days. But it’s hard to pinpoint how big a role the Biden administration played, as school communities were also influenced by other factors such as increased vaccinations, declines in cases, parent pressure and changes in state or local guidance. 
The Biden administration prioritized increasing vaccine supply to the states, which led more adults, including teachers, to be vaccinated. But with 13,000 school districts nationwide, there was no overarching explanation for why or when local and state officials decided to reopen schools.
CDC guidance on school reopenings faced criticism
Early on, Biden and his administration gave conflicting messages about his school reopening goals. In December, he said he wanted to reopen the majority of schools during his first 100 days. But in January he narrowed that goal to apply to the majority of K-8 schools. 
The CDC issued recommendations on Feb. 12 that called for reopened schools to employ universal masking, keep everyone 6 feet apart, clean regularly, and require quarantining and contract tracing for new cases. 
The CDC also released a color-coded tool to guide reopening decisions based on weekly transmission levels. The controversial tool landed about 90% of the communities in the red zone due to high rates of transmission. By the guidelines, many middle and high schools would have had to close. Two public health experts concluded that the color-coded guidance would unnecessarily keep millions out of school.
Some states such as Florida, which had been offering in person instruction since the fall, shrugged at the CDC’s guidance. 
And one month later, the CDC generally shrank the 6-foot rule to 3 feet, except in some middle and high schools where transmission is high. 
""The move from 6 feet to 3 feet was absolutely an accelerator for school reopenings,"" said Dennis Roche, president of Burbio, a firm that is tracking data on school reopenings.
Just before the CDC issued the 3-foot guidance, Burbio found that school districts in multiple states were spacing desks by 3 feet as they converted to traditional in-person instruction from hybrid systems in which children attended school both online and in person. That trend continued in March and April with some districts citing the 3-foot rule in their decisions to fully reopen in person.
On March 2, Biden said he was directing states to prioritize vaccinating teachers. But by that point, more than 30 states had already done so — and some states that hadn’t prioritized teachers had reopened schools anyway.
The CDC found through federal data and surveys that nearly 80% of pre-K through 12th grade school staff and childcare workers received at least their first shot by the end of March.

Biden also said the American Rescue Plan — which he signed into law in March — funded school reopening. While figures show almost $129 billion will go toward the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, Biden’s statement seems to ignore that most of that money is directed to be spent after 2021. 
Schools have moved toward in-person learning throughout 2021
There are two main ways to track weekly K-12 school openings: by school district or by students. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, publishes a tracker that monitors over 8,500 public school districts on whether they’re operating with fully remote, hybrid or fully in-person learning. According to its metrics, about 5% of districts were fully remote as of mid-April, compared with about 20% a couple days before Biden took office. 
Burbio, which tracks about 1,200 school districts, found that about 6% of students were in fully remote schools as of late April, compared with about half of students a couple days before Biden took office.
The trackers show that schools have steadily moved toward in-person instruction in 2021. But we couldn’t find any evidence of a significant shift to in-person learning that was specifically tied to the CDC’s February guidance, Biden’s announcement that all teachers were eligible for vaccines, or the promise of American Rescue Plan money. 
""The real answer is there was a lot of things pushing schools to reopen during this period and all sort of tailwinds for reopening, making it pretty hard to figure out which one is the one to look at,"" said Nat Malkus, an expert on K-12 education at the American Enterprise Institute.
COVID-19 cases were declining in areas. Vaccinations were increasing. Parents were pressing schools to open. Pediatricians and health experts were urging a return to school. And some governors were advocating for more in-person instruction.
Biden’s efforts probably helped some districts move toward reopening, Malkus said, but ""as far as the overall trend, I don’t think you can give the Biden administration a lot of credit for driving it."" 
Sean R. Gill, a research analyst at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, said he believes the actions of states and governors had more of an impact than Biden’s moves. ""Even in California, they made some new state funds contingent on being open for in-person or hybrid learning,"" he said.
Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the state board of education in California, credited both Biden and state action with fueling reopenings there. The dramatic increase in vaccine supply under Biden’s watch ""made a big difference because many many districts were waiting on vaccines to get to teachers to reopen schools,"" she said. Similarly, school leaders were able to start counting on money that would be coming.
Our ruling
Biden says his administration’s efforts have led to more school reopenings.
Biden cited guidelines issued by the CDC, his announcement to prioritize vaccinating educators and the passage of the American Rescue Plan.
We found it’s difficult to pinpoint the factors that drove more schools to reopen in 2021. While some of the Biden administration’s actions helped, many states and schools were already moving toward more in-person learning when those initiatives were announced. Other factors also played a role, including COVID-19 infection rates, overall vaccination rates, pressure from parents and decisions by local and state officials.

Thom Tillis","Tillis omits key facts about Cunningham, PPP




If Your Time is short




U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) saidhis opponent, Democrat Cal Cunningham, ""criticized (the Paycheck Protection Program) while his company benefitted.""
Cunningham says he supports the PPP, but has called for more oversight.
Cunningham also works for a company that received a PPP loan. But the company's CEO says Cunningham wasn't involved in the application process and hasn't benefited from the loan.




See the sources for this fact-check




North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis is accusing his opponent of being a hypocrite.
Tillis, a Republican, recently criticized Democrat Cal Cunningham for criticizing a federal government bailout program that benefited ""his"" company.
""I supported the Paycheck Protection Program because it helped save one million NC jobs. Cal Cunningham criticized it while his company benefitted,"" Tillis tweeted on July 7.
Tillis later called Cunningham a ""hypocrite.""

There have been several other claims about Cunningham, the PPP funding and WasteZero that are worth clearing up.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee tweeted on July 7 that Cunningham ""used"" funding from the program. In a press conference on July 16, North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley claimed that Cunningham ""was working on this (PPP) application at the same time as he was criticizing it.""
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Cunningham’s campaign tweeted about the issue, referring to Cunningham’s employment in the past tense.
But we’re going to focus on the Tillis tweet from July 7, since he’s a U.S. Senator levying a claim. Along the way, you’ll notice other claims are misleading or simply unfounded.
Here’s a summary of what we found.


Has Cunningham ""criticized"" the PPP rollout? He offered what some might call constructive criticism. He has said he supports the program, but says that administrators need to do a better job of getting funding to deserving companies. Tillis has also expressed concerns about getting money to small businesses. 


Is WasteZero Cunningham’s company? Cunningham is not a founder and the campaign says he has no ownership stake. He was on the payroll for seven years and now works for the firm on a contract basis.


Did Cunningham help WasteZero apply for the PPP funds or benefit from them? WasteZero’s CEO says no.


What is the PPP?
The Paycheck Protection Program was launched as part of the federal government’s coronavirus relief package. It offers loans designed to encourage small businesses to keep workers on their payroll during the pandemic.
While the program has helped people, it has drawn criticism too.
The Washington Post reported that the first pool of loan money — worth $350 billion — was gone by April 16 and left 80% of applicants without aid. Businesses that received loans came under scrutiny.
The first wave of recipients included 43 companies that have more than the maximum number of employees typically allowed under the program, the Post reported. Recipients have also included people with connections to President Donald Trump, such as Kanye West and Jared Kushner’s family.
The claim about Cunningham and his employer, WasteZero, was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet.
Cunningham and WasteZero
The company was founded in 1991, the year Cunningham turned 18 year-old. It hired Cunningham in 2013 to be its chief marketing officer, according to a press release. 
PPP records show that WasteZero applied for between $1 million and $2 million in loans and was approved for aid on May 3, potentially helping 115 employees.
Cunningham’s campaign told the Charlotte Observer that he left WasteZero on March 20, a week before President Trump signed the PPP into law on March 27. 
A WasteZero payroll document shows Cunningham’s job as general counsel was ""terminated"" on March 20. The campaign provided the payroll document to PolitiFact, and WasteZero CEO David Bryla verified its authenticity.

However, Bryla and Cunningham himself say he still does contract work for WasteZero and is paid on an hourly basis.
A company report filed in Massachusetts was signed by Cunningham on March 31. The report covered the 2019 calendar year. On one part of the report, Cunningham is listed as a company vice president. But, when signing the contract, Cunningham referred to himself as ""other officer.""
(An aside: The Tillis campaign has accused the Cunningham campaign of lying about his involvement with the company. The Tillis campaign points to discrepancies in how Cunningham and his campaign have described his work. Cunningham told a McClatchy reporter that he is helping the company ""transition"" to his successor, while a campaign spokeswoman tweeted that Cunningham ""used to"" work there. The Tillis campaign noted that the Charlotte Observer story had to be updated to include Cunningham’s work on March 31.)
WasteZero and PPP
So, was Cunningham involved in the PPP application?
Under the PPP program, small businesses could apply for a loan using payroll information dating back to February — when Cunningham would have been a full-time employee.
Bryla, the company CEO, told PolitiFact that Cunningham ""was not involved in the application for PPP funds and did not benefit from them.""
""The decision to pursue a PPP loan in order to help keep our employees on payroll was made at the board level and spearheaded by me and our CFO,"" Bryla told PolitiFact in an email. ""Cal left company payroll on March 20, before the PPP loan application process even began, has not been on payroll since, and therefore was not among those on staff who have benefited from the loan, which has helped us maintain workers.""
On July 16, North Carolina GOP Chairman Whatley said Cunningham should call on WasteZero to release its PPP application. Doing so, he said, would prove he had no connection to the application.
(A quick reminder about the PolitiFact rating process: when a person makes a claim, the burden of proof is on that person. The speaker is responsible for providing evidence to support their claim.)
Cunningham and PPP
Now let’s look at what Cunningham said about the PPP. Cunningham has mostly criticized the way the program was rolled out and its lack of oversight, not the existence of the program itself.
In May, Cunningham told Spectrum News that the PPP money has ""ended up in some of the wrong hands."" He said:
""I think we need to focus on making sure small businesses can keep people on the payroll. And very important for North Carolina, a lot of women-owned and minority-owned businesses have been cut out of that very process. And finally, a very, very important – and it’s a priority I’ve been returning to time and again – we’re spending a lot of money. Necessarily in order to protect people in a time like this, there needs to be very robust accountability and oversight for how money is being spent.""
His campaign released a pair of press releases calling for more oversight. In a tweet and Facebook post on June 17, he referenced a story by Axios, saying:
""For PPP loans to have ‘generally missed the industries and areas most heavily impacted by COVID-19’ is unacceptable. Leaving behind small businesses — and disproportionately those that are Black- and Latino-owned — harms communities. We need oversight.""
Also on June 17, Cunningham spoke during an online forum hosted by WRAL. He described himself as a ""strong proponent of the interventions that are necessary to help keep our companies moving, keeping people on the payroll (through) measures like the Paycheck Protection Program.""
Cunningham also told CNN he is ""very concerned"" about the lack of ""vigorous and meaningful mechanisms for oversight of federal stimulus money. He made similar comments to other outlets too, which the Tillis campaign referenced in their press release.
Tillis, for his part, has also shared concerns about small business loans not getting to small businesses. Fox News host Dana Perino asked Tillis about the program during an interview on April 20.
Perino played a clip of U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida who has also criticized the PPP rollout. In the clip, Scott says, ""banks should be helping those who need it the most, not, you know, who helps them.""
After the clip is played, Perino asks Tillis if he shares Scott’s concerns. Tillis said:
""Yeah, I do. I think part of the problem is that some of the smaller businesses -- they don’t have the resources necessarily to even get the baseline documents that were needed to apply for the loan. We have to make sure in this next trunch that we’re casting a wider net with the smaller businesses.""
Our ruling
Tillis said ""Cal Cunningham criticized (the Paycheck Protection Program) while his company benefitted.""
Cunningham criticized the PPP to the extent that it wasn’t reaching enough companies and lacked adequate oversight -- and he’s not alone. Republican senators, including Tillis, have expressed similar concerns.
As for WasteZero being ""his"" company, Cunningham currently works for the company on a contract basis. Cunningham was not a founder. And PolitiFact is not aware of any ownership stake he has in the company. Furthermore, the CEO says  Cunningham wasn’t involved in the PPP application, or the decision to pursue PPP funds.

Joe Biden","Joe Biden conflates tests on the market with Americans tested




If Your Time is short




A Trump administration official said March 21 that he expected 27 million tests in the market one week later.

The number of tests in the market is not the same as the number of Americans tested.


Completed tests are far less than capacity because of the shortfalls in related testing supplies.





See the sources for this fact-check




While President Donald Trump has lauded increased testing for COVID-19, his rival Joe Biden said the administration has failed to deliver on its promises.
""The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. As of now, only 4 million have been completed,"" Biden tweeted April 21.
 
Tests play a huge role in managing the COVID-19 crisis and planning for the recovery. Health experts say that the country needs a massive increase in testing before states can reopen businesses and schools, although some governors are already moving in that direction. The U.S. has lacked a national widespread testing program, a result of early missteps and a lack of capacity and supplies.
Is the Trump administration really short on its March promise by 23 million tests? 
We found that Biden’s tweet conflates the number of tests the Trump administration said would be on the market with the number of people who have been tested. About 4 million people in the U.S. have been tested as of April 21, according to Johns Hopkins University.
What the Trump administration ""promised"" 
The 27 million number comes from a White House briefing March 21. A reporter asked about the number of available tests.
Brett Giroir, who is overseeing testing for the federal government, responded: ""So, from March 2 to March 14, we have put over 10 million laboratory tests into the U.S. commercial market, and we expect that, by March 28, to be well over 27 million into the market. So that answers your question.""
But Giroir said that was the wrong question to ask because not every lab can run every test.
""So, the more important question is not how many tests are in the market — we got them in the market — but it’s to make sure that every segment of the market has the kind of test that they can use,"" said Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Giroir’s figure of over 27 million referred to how many tests he said would be in the market — not how many people would be tested. 
Earlier in the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence brought up the number of Americans tested, which he said was around 210,000. ""The White House was clear that these were two separate numbers,"" Zack Parkinson, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told PolitiFact.
Parkinson said that Giroir didn’t make a ""promise"" on the 27 million tests. We will leave it up to readers to decide.

About one month later, Giroir was asked about the 27 million number at a White House briefing. The reporter’s question sounded a lot like what Biden later tweeted:
""On March 24 — March 21, the administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. So far, roughly 4 million people have been tested. So where are the other 23 million or so tests? Did they not materialize? Are they in the pipeline? Help us understand that discrepancy."" 
Giroir replied that he was referring to tests in the marketplace.
""So if you want to use those metrics, there’s been over 40 million ‘in the marketplace.’ But we have an end-to-end issue that we needed to deal with, and that’s what we’ve been dealing with: the swabs, the transport media,"" Giroir said April 20.
""We have some of our main platforms that are only 10% being utilized,"" he continued. ""You could have a lot of tests in the market, and those are correct numbers, but if the machines aren’t utilizing them and they’re not organized at that level, then they’re not being utilized to its fullest.""
In other words, it takes more than simply having the test kit available to perform and process the tests.
Trump has overstated the scope of U.S. testing multiple times. He said that people were being tested getting on and off airplanes and that anybody can get a test, statements we rated Pants on Fire.
Trump has portrayed the tests as readily available, but several governors say that they aren’t getting enough swabs and reagents to administer large-scale testing. 
And Trump has sometimes talked about millions of tests without specifying that he was referring to testing kits.
""We have now a great system and it’s almost fully in gear, but it’s able to test millions of people,"" Trump said March 20. At the time, about 140,000 people had been tested, according to the COVID Tracking Project. 
Our ruling
Biden tweeted, ""The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. As of now, only 4 million have been completed.""
Biden conflated two different metrics: the number of projected available tests in the market and the number of people in the U.S. actually tested. 
On March 21, a Trump administration official said he expected well over 27 million tests in the marketplace by March 28. As of April 21, about 4 million people had been tested.

Experts say Biden is wrong to say that the U.S. travel restriction was slow. It came shortly after the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency and around the same time as other nations’ restrictions.

President Donald Trump routinely claims that he went against everyone’s wishes when he decided to restrict travel from China to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. Because he did, and fast, thousands of lives were saved, Trump says.
But Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said Trump’s response wasn’t all that quick.
Biden told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on April 5 that Trump trailed dozens of other countries in issuing travel restrictions on China. (This was a week before Stephanopoulos confirmed he had COVID-19.)
""He indicated that I complimented him on dealing with China. Well, you know, 45 nations had already moved to keep, block China's personnel from being able to come to the United States before the president moved,"" Biden said. ""It's about pace. It's about the urgency. And I don't think there's been enough of it, urgency.""
PolitiFact decided to put Biden’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. Taken literally, Biden’s statement that 45 countries blocked Chinese personnel from ""being able to come to the United States"" doesn’t make sense — the countries were dealing with travel from China into their own countries, of course. Biden’s campaign did not provide an on-the-record clarification.
Based on the context of the interview, Biden’s point was that 45 nations imposed restrictions on travel from China before the United States’ own restriction, therefore the United States was slow on this front. We found that the United States acted around the same time as did many other countries. It wasn’t the first to restrict travel from China, but it wasn’t the last, either.
Timeline of restrictions on travel from China
COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, was first detected in Wuhan, China, and was reported by Chinese authorities to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019.
On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern over the coronavirus outbreak.
On Jan. 31, the Trump administration announced the United States would temporarily ban the admission of people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted travel to the United States. The restriction took effect Feb. 2, and it exempted U.S. citizens, green card holders, and certain other people.
What was the rest of the world considering? We consulted Think Global Health, an initiative of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations that is tracking travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19.
By the group’s count, Biden is correct about 45 nations restricting travel from China before the United States.That number covers variations of travel restrictions in effect up to and including Feb. 1.
Think Global Health’s tracker includes partial or total land border closures, suspension of flights to and from China, visa restrictions, such as a pause on visa-on-arrival programs, and entry restrictions (similar to what the United States implemented).
""While the United States was not one of the first countries to impose restrictions against travel from China, nor was it late to do so relative to the actions of others,"" said Samantha Kiernan, a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Rather, the United States acted around the same time that many other countries did.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The Marshall Islands is among nations that had travel restrictions on China even before the World Health Organization’s Jan. 30 declaration. After the declaration, many countries, including the United States, announced their own travel restrictions.
For perspective, the U.S. measure went into effect after Italy on Jan. 31 suspended all flights to and from China, but it happened before South Korea’s entry restriction that started Feb. 4.
There are many ways to slice the numbers on travel restrictions, said Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. In a March 23 blog post, Nowrasteh estimated that at least 36 other countries imposed travel restrictions on people coming from China around the same time as the United States.
""Some countries, for instance, began forcing Chinese nationals to get a visa around this time whereas before they were allowed visa-free entry,"" Nowrasteh said. ""That’s an additional travel restriction, but a less onerous one than that imposed by President Trump.""
Nowrasteh agreed that the United States’ restriction wasn’t far behind from others.
""There are many points on which to criticize the Trump administration’s response to COVID-19, but they were not slow in instituting a travel ban on China,"" Nowrasteh said. ""The real question is whether that restriction worked and there is little evidence to suggest that it did.""
RELATED: Are COVID-19 travel restrictions ‘more critical in saving lives’ than testing? Not really
Global health specialists told Kaiser Health News that there is little to no evidence that Trump’s restrictions restrained COVID-19, because they came too late and didn’t have the follow-up necessary to make a real dent.
Research suggests that well-implemented travel restrictions can buy time, but that time has to be used effectively — to ramp up emergency preparedness and bolster activities like testing and isolating people who may have been exposed.
As late as Feb. 29, the WHO advised against travel or trade restrictions related to COVID-19 outbreaks, saying: ""Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact."" 
Our ruling
Biden claimed that ""45 nations had already moved"" to enforce travel restrictions with China ""before the president moved.""
The extent of travel restrictions vary — from the suspension of visa programs to entry denial. According to one tracker of travel restrictions, Biden’s 45 figure checks out. Other research shows that the number is around 36.
Where Biden misleads is on the relative speed of the U.S. compared with others. The U.S. travel restriction came shortly after the WHO declared a public health emergency and around the same time as other nations, experts said.

Trump has a small stake through a mutual fund in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine.


The president’s holdings in Sanofi are valued at up to $1,500, meaning he would not stand to profit much from the company’s stock performance.

Some Facebook users think President Donald Trump’s recent interest in a lupus and arthritis drug goes beyond its potential to treat COVID-19.
""Trump himself has a financial stake in the French company that makes the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine,"" reads one post published April 7.
The image, which is a screenshot of a tweet from Ian Sams, the former national press secretary for Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was shared in a group for ""center left pragmatic progressives"" called The 47ers. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)


In the past few weeks, Trump has touted the potential of chloroquine and the related drug hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19. There is some preliminary evidence that the drugs could be effective in treating the coronavirus, but more rigorous tests have not been completed. There is currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for COVID-19.
We’ve previously reported on alleged financial ties between the Trump administration and hydroxychloroquine manufacturers, so we wanted to look into this claim, too.
Trump does have a small financial stake in a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine. But the implication of the post, that Trump could stand to profit from that stake, is misleading. 
The New York Times reported on April 6 that the president has a personal financial interest in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund from a firm called Dodge & Cox. At 3.3%, Sanofi is the largest holding of the firm’s International Stock Fund.
But Trump’s stake in that fund is rather small.

The president’s latest financial disclosure form indicates that he holds shares in the mutual fund through three different family trusts. The value of each of those holdings is between $1,001 and $15,000, which would put Trump’s stake in Sanofi at ""between about $100 and $1,500 in total,"" the Washington Post reported.
""That Sanofi investment would therefore constitute between 0.000003 and 0.00005 percent of Trump’s net worth,"" the newspaper wrote. ""If you were worth $100,000, it would be like worrying about the nickel in your pocket.""
RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know
Let’s pretend that Trump’s last financial disclosure form is up-to-date and that his total holdings in Sanofi are valued at $1,500 — the high end of the range.
Since March 20, the day after the president first mentioned chloroquine during a press briefing, the company’s stock value has increased by about 17.3%. That would mean the value of Trump’s shares in Sanofi has increased by nearly $260.
Given the president’s net worth, which Bloomberg estimates to be nearly $3 billion, $260 would be a comparatively small payoff for promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Plus, it’s uncertain whether Trump’s remarks have affected Sanofi’s stock value; the company has performed about as well as the broader stock market.
Legally, experts say Trump’s holdings in Sanofi don’t constitute a conflict of interest.
Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University, said in an email that federal law prohibits executive branch officials from participating in matters in which they have a financial interest. But the law exempts diversified mutual funds like the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund — and because he’s the president, Trump isn’t subject to the regulation anyway.
""When Congress amended the ethics laws in 1989, it exempted the president from the criminal financial conflict of interest statute. So the statute doesn’t apply to Trump at all,"" Clark said. ""And even if this statute did apply to the president, the regulation’s exemption would seem to apply here. So Trump’s touting of this drug does not violate the criminal conflict of interest statute.""

Michael Bloomberg","Did Donald Trump fire pandemic officials, defund CDC?




If Your Time is short




“Fired” may be a little strong, but in 2018, top national security officials handling pandemics left abruptly and were not replaced by the Trump administration.

 
As for funding, there’s no question that the Trump administration sought to cut key CDC budget categories. But thanks to Congress, that funding was restored and even increased in bills that Trump ultimately signed.




See the sources for this fact-check




During a CNN town hall before the South Carolina primary, Mike Bloomberg — a former New York City mayor and Democratic presidential candidate — was asked whether he had confidence in President Donald Trump to handle a potential coronavirus pandemic, officially known as the COVID-19 virus.
After jokingly saying, ""I feel so much better,"" Bloomberg told the audience, ""No. 1, he fired the pandemic team two years ago. No. 2, he's been defunding the Centers for Disease Control. So, we don't have the experts in place that we need. I hope he's right that the virus doesn't come here, that nobody gets sick. That would be a wonderful outcome. But the bottom line is, we are not ready for this kind of thing.""
Bloomberg had a point that the Trump administration ousted some of its officials dealing with global pandemics, but ""defunding"" the CDC is more complicated than he let on.
""He fired the pandemic team two years ago""
""Fired"" may be a strong word, but there have been abrupt changes to key national security posts with responsibility for global pandemics. More recently the administration has assigned new officials to take leadership roles.
In May 2018, the top White House official in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics left the administration. Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer was the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council and oversaw global health security issues, a specialty that had been bolstered under President Barack Obama.
After Ziemer’s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease and biological warfare, was reportedly pushed out by Bolton in 2018. Neither White House official or their teams, which were responsible for coordinating the U.S. response to pandemic outbreaks across agencies, have been replaced during the past two years.
In November 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers and experts formally recommended that health security leadership on the NSC should be restored. And on Feb. 18, 2020, a group of 27 senators sent a letter to current National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to ask him to appoint a new global health security expert to the NSC.
""The fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the White House that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning,"" Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran foreign disaster assistance in the Obama administration, told the Guardian. ""Both the structure and all the institutional memory is gone now.""
Instead, Trump has looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. 
Last month, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. On Feb. 26, he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would be taking charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus. 
And the following day, Pence announced he was appointing Ambassador Debbie Birx to assist the effort as ""White House coronavirus response coordinator."" Birx is a physician and global health expert who is currently responsible for coordinating the State Department's HIV/AIDS task force. The White House said she will be supported by NSC staff in her role.

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







""He's been defunding Centers for Disease Control.""
It’s not accurate to say that Trump has been ""defunding"" the CDC, but he has tried to make cuts in key programs. It’s just that Congress didn’t listen.
The Trump administration’s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at CDC — a key player in the fight against coronavirus — have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year. 
The administration proposed $61.7 million less in 2018 than 2017; $96.4 million less in 2019 than in 2018; $114.4 million less in 2020 than in 2019; and $85.3 million less in 2021 than 2020.
However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as they see fit when they craft final spending bills.
Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed bills — bills signed by Trump — that not only exceeded what Trump requested on emerging infections but also exceeded what had been spent the previous year.
As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020. (We have not included the 2017 proposal, since that was submitted by the Obama administration. The figures for 2020 are preliminary.)

It’s important to note that Trump has asked Congress for a $2.5 billion supplemental budget to help combat the emergence of this coronavirus. House Democrats quickly said the amount was insufficient to meet current threats, and Trump said he was willing to seek more if lawmakers were willing.
In addition, the Trump campaign pointed to consistent funding for certain budget sub-categories, such as CDC’s public health emergency preparedness, which helps states and localities deal with public health emergencies, including outbreaks. That program suffered funding losses that predate Trump.
Our ruling
Bloomberg said Trump is hampered in the fight against coronavirus because ""No. 1, he fired the pandemic team two years ago. No. 2, he's been defunding Centers for Disease Control.""
On the first point, it’s hard to pin down whether the National Security Council staffers were ""fired"" in 2018, but they certainly left abruptly and have not been replaced, though other leaders in the coronavirus fight have been named in recent days.
On the second point — funding — there’s no question that the Trump administration sought to cut key CDC budget categories that would be involved in emerging infections like coronavirus. But Bloomberg overlooks that, thanks to Congress, that funding was restored and even increased in bills that were ultimately signed by Trump.

Greg Abbott","Recovery data on coronavirus is lacking




If Your Time is short




Looking just at the cumulative recovery statistics from the available states — 14 states have not published current data on recoveries — Texas ranks third. But it is important to note that there are many different definitions of what constitutes a recovery. For example, the Texas figure is an estimate based on hospitalizations and recovery times.
Given the size of Texas' population, it makes sense to compare recovery statistics as a rate, as opposed to looking at the cumulative recoveries. Looking at the percentage of recoveries per positive coronavirus test, Texas ranks 16th among the states that have published data.




See the sources for this fact-check




Ahead of his announcement that Texas would commence the second phase of its reopening after a statewide stay-at-home order had lifted, Gov. Greg Abbott celebrated ""GREAT NEWS"" for the state in a tweet.
""The number of Texans who have RECOVERED from #COVID19 now exceeds the number of active COVID cases for the past 2 days,"" Abbott said. ""That’s exactly what we want to see. Texas ranks 3rd highest among states for number of people who have recovered from #coronavirus.""
Abbott had announced that he would allow the statewide stay-at-home order he issued on April 2 to expire on the last day of April, allowing retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls to open, with limited capacity, on May 1.
At the time, Abbott said he would commence the second phase of his reopening plan by May 18, assuming there was no secondary ""flare-up"" of COVID-19 cases in the state.
But on Tuesday, Abbott said coronavirus metrics for the state signaled that it would be appropriate to start the second phase of his plan ahead of schedule, allowing barbershops, and hair, nail and tanning salons to open at limited capacity later in the week.
Ahead of his this announcement, Abbott shared the statement we’re checking and said Texas is the third highest in the nation for the number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus.
But what does that number mean?
Recovery statistics are not a factor that indicate a state’s readiness to reopen, according to guidelines from the White House.
The guidelines, released in April, highlight certain criteria states should meet before opening: a downward trajectory of COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms, a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests and a robust testing program for healthcare workers, including antibody testing.
The number of recoveries is also not a metric used to calculate the prevalence (current cases) or incidence (new cases) of an infectious disease, according to Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s School of Medicine.
""Recovery, even if it were measured properly, does not reflect interventions because we have almost none,"" Cohen said. ""Such statistics are generally used to measure the success of a health care system when testing and treatments might be robust.""
Examining recoveries
The raw counts of recovered cases available show that Texas does rank third, but there is a lot to unpack with this data. Abbott’s office did not return a request for comment seeking information about the data behind his statement.
The main difficulty in weighing the statement is the quality of the data on recoveries. Fourteen states do not have current recovery data recorded by the COVID Tracking Project, an organization launched by The Atlantic that collects and publishes data from each state’s health agencies on the virus.
The group’s website warns that data on patient outcomes, including hospitalizations, deaths and recoveries is ""less consistently reported"" than other data, like the number of tests administered.
A visit to the website of each of these 14 states’ health authorities did not turn up any data on recoveries.
There are also different definitions for what it means to have recovered from COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has offered guidance on this front, but says that states and local health authorities can adapt the guidance as needed.
The guidance outlines different standards, based on whether an individual has tested positive for the virus and whether the person is displaying symptoms. It also depends on whether a person is caring for themselves at home or has been in the care of a physician.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







A person without symptoms can discontinue isolation, as long as at least 10 days have passed since first testing positive for COVID-19 and the individual did not later develop symptoms. In cases where symptoms are present, it depends on when the person last had a fever and when symptoms show signs of letting up.
In places with ample testing supplies, the CDC recommends a ""test-based strategy"" for assessing whether a person is still sick.
In Texas, the number of patients recorded as recovered is an estimate ""based on several assumptions related to hospitalization rates and recovery times, which were informed by data available to date. These assumptions are subject to change as we learn more about COVID-19,"" according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard.
But even using the limited data available, there is also the size of the state’s population to consider.
Given that Texas is the second most populous state, it makes more sense to consider the rate of recovery by state — the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 relative to the total number of those infected — than the total number of recoveries.
Looking at the numbers
When Abbott shared this tweet on May 4, the latest coronavirus figures from Texas were as follows: 407,398 tests administered with 32,332 positive results, 884 deaths and 16,090 recoveries.
Looking just at the cumulative number of recoveries at this date, Texas ranks third among all 37 states and Washington D.C. that have statewide recovery data available.
New York recorded the most recoveries, with 58,950, followed by Louisiana, with 20,316. New York has reported far more cumulative coronavirus cases than any other state (318,953 as of May 4), and Louisiana has been a hot spot for the virus, although it has reported fewer cases than Texas.
In March, Abbott instituted a mandatory quarantine order for travelers arriving in the state from various coronavirus hot spots, including New York and Louisiana. At the end of April, Abbott removed Louisiana from the list. 
Travelers from California, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Washington and the cities of Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit and Miami are still required to self-quarantine for two weeks upon their arrival in Texas.
Recovery rate
At the time of Abbott’s claim, nearly half of all people who tested positive for coronavirus had been reported as recovered — a recovery rate of 49.76%.
Using this figure to compare across the 37 states and Washington D.C. that have recovery data, Texas ranks 16th using this measure.
Montana has the highest recovery rate, as more than 88% of the 457 people who tested positive have been reported as recovered.
Our ruling
Abbott said Texas ranks third among states for the number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus.
The available figures on cumulative COVID-19 recoveries by state show that Texas ranks third — but that data has limitations. For one, just 37 states and Washington D.C. have been recording data on recoveries. Also, different standards are in place for determining whether a patient has recovered.
In Texas, the statewide figure for recoveries is an estimate based on hospitalization data.
Plus, a better metric for comparison is the recovery rate of the virus, given Texas’ population size. Using this measure, Texas ranks 16th among those states with data.

Pennsylvania







Donald Trump","Fact-checking Trump’s claim that Gov. Tom Wolf is keeping ‘barely affected' parts of Pa. closed




If Your Time is short




Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has already moved 37 Pennsylvania counties into what he calls the ‘yellow’ phase of reopening. In these places, many businesses may resume in-person operations, and residents may leave their homes so long as they take precautions. 

 
The number of people sickened with the virus in Lancaster, Lebanon, Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties disqualifies them from entering the yellow phase. But that fact didn’t stop local leaders from announcing plans to reopen businesses anyway – with or without Wolf’s blessing.

 
Until recently, another nine counties found themselves in limbo. They had reported fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period, but until May 15, when Wolf announced plans to move them into the yellow phase soon, they remained stuck in the red zone.




 See the sources for this fact-check




After touring an Allentown warehouse filled with protective medical equipment, President Donald Trump criticized Gov. Tom Wolf for keeping parts of Pennsylvania closed that the president thinks are no longer threatened by the coronavirus.
""You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed,"" Trump told a crowd of workers from Owens & Minor, a company that manufactures and distributes masks, gloves and gowns to health care workers, on May 14.
We wondered whether the statewide stay-at-home order Wolf issued on April 1 still applies to places hardly impacted by the deadly disease.
It all depends what criteria are used to determine whether the coronavirus still poses a threat.
The virus is still raging across Southeastern Pennsylvania, and not even Trump is arguing that Philadelphia and its suburbs are ready to reopen. Officials in Delaware and Bucks counties, however, have asked Wolf to exclude their nursing-home populations when he eventually rates their readiness. 
""Largely when you look across the state, the hardest hit area has been the Southeast of Pennsylvania,"" said Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, which has been tracking the differences in the outbreak across individual regions of the country.
The Philadelphia area as far west as Lancaster, Berks and Dauphin counties, and north to the Lehigh Valley have seen some of the worst outbreaks in Pennsylvania, he said.
""Largely the rest of the state has had a pretty deceptively, sort of minimal experience with COVID,"" Rubin said.
That includes Allegheny County, the rural ""T"" and the South, Central and Southwestern parts of the state.
""When you have someone in that area of the state that are upset that they are unable to work, they’re not wrong,"" Rubin said. But for those in the Southeast worried about a resurgence, ""they’re not wrong, either.""
Wolf has already moved 37 Pennsylvania counties into what he calls the ‘yellow’ phase of reopening. 
In these places, many businesses may resume in-person operations, and residents may leave their homes so long as they take precautions. Thirteen counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania moved into the yellow phase May 15. Twenty-four others in the Northern half of the state entered yellow May 8. Another 12 counties will move into yellow on May 22. 
Counties in the red phase of Wolf’s reopening plan are still under lockdown, with stay-at-home orders in place and all but ‘essential’ businesses closed. Counties that eventually make it to the green phase will ask businesses and individuals to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department of Health guidelines for limiting the spread of the virus but will otherwise have no restrictions. 
Yellow counties’ gyms, hair salons, and schools must remain closed, and gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited.
Even still, yellow is the distinction several other Central and Eastern Pennsylvania counties are clamoring for.
A key factor that determines whether a county qualifies for yellow privileges is whether it has fewer than 50 new reported coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents over a period of 14 days.

The number of people sickened with the virus in Lancaster, Lebanon, Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties disqualifies them from entering the yellow phase. But that fact didn’t stop local leaders from announcing plans to reopen businesses anyway – with or without Wolf’s blessing.
In a series of letters and tweets, the officials, including state lawmakers and county commissioners, begged Wolf to allow local businesses to reopen and better position themselves to survive the crisis. Officials from Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties later backed down. Lebanon officials are set to vote on reopening today. Lancaster officials held a news conference on the issue Thursday night but did not say what they will do.
Counties reversed course after Wolf called them ‘cowardly’ and ‘selfish’ and threatened to withhold their federal stimulus funds if they directed businesses and residents to defy his order.
Until recently, another nine counties found themselves in limbo.
They had reported fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period, but until May 15, when Wolf announced plans to move them into the yellow phase soon, they remained stuck in the red zone, which requires businesses to stay closed and residents to continue sheltering at home. Those counties include: York, Adams, Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Carbon, Wyoming, Susquehanna and Wayne.
Officials from York and Adams counties had been especially vocal about their frustration that businesses had not been cleared to reopen. Some officials said they didn’t understand what was holding them back, given their success keeping coronavirus case counts relatively low.
Wolf had been asked about the discrepancy several times in recent days before he announced plans to move the counties into yellow by May 22, and his explanations lacked clarity. We had to read a 7,000 word Wolf administration document titled ""Process to Reopen Pennsylvania"" to figure it out.
A county’s coronavirus case count is not the only piece of information Wolf’s team uses to determine when it’s ready to move into the yellow phase. He’s said this publicly, but on recent calls with the press, he hasn’t listed the other factors that matter. Carnegie Mellon University researchers advising the state compiled the list and rated counties in each category.
According to the document, the other factors are:
A county’s ability to meet a surge in demand for intensive care.
A county’s density.
The share of county residents who are over age 60.
The share of county residents who work in ""physically closed"" industry sectors, such as nursing homes.   
When those pieces are considered, it appears York County was held back from reopening because of its population density, and Adams County was ordered to stay closed because it has an insufficient number of intensive care unit beds. Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Carbon, Susquehanna and Wayne counties were also flagged because of limited ICU capacity.
We had to click through a link tucked at the bottom of a May 8 press release to find a May 7 PowerPoint presentation detailing how each Pennsylvania county rates on the Carnegie Mellon risk assessment scale. It’s unclear if county officials calling to have their stay-at-home orders lifted know where to find their own ratings.
Wyoming County in the Northeast corner of the state has a small number of coronavirus cases and doesn’t rate as high risk in any of the other categories. Before Wolf announced that Wyoming County would move into the yellow phase by May 22, it was unclear why Wolf wouldn’t allow businesses there to reopen. County officials had announced plans to reopen without Wolf’s approval and later backed down. 
In the ""Process to Reopen Pennsylvania"" document, the state cautioned that the reopening process will be fluid and that the Carnegie Mellon rating system is not designed to ""make decisions but rather to inform decision makers.""
Our ruling
Trump said that Wolf wants to keep parts of Pennsylvania closed that have been ""barely affected"" by the coronavirus. Trump was likely speaking about counties in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania like Lebanon and Lancaster whose Republican lawmakers have been clamoring for more freedom even though their coronavirus case counts remain relatively high. Those places have not been ""barely affected."" They’re battling active outbreaks. Trump was right, though, that until May 15, Wolf wanted to keep closed nine counties with relatively few cases.

Instagram posts","Were Democratic lawmakers 'caught' maskless at White House? This needs context




If Your Time is short





The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidance for fully vaccinated Americans on May 13, allowing them to gather indoors without masks.


A widely shared video of Democrats mingling without masks in the White House came after the CDC updated its guidance for fully vaccinated Americans.





See the sources for this fact-check




Social media accounts popular with conservatives are claiming that a clip of lawmakers at a recent White House event shows ""Dems caught not wearing masks.""
""It’s not about your health,"" says the text on the video, which was shared widely on Instagram, including by One America News Network, a pro-Trump outlet. ""It’s about control.""
Instagram posts sharing the video were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 

The video, made from a 12-second clip posted by the Recount, shows Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Attorney General Merrick Garland and other politicians mingling in the White House. The group gathered as President Joe Biden signed into law a bill meant to address the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic.

The video is missing critical context: The Democrats present were acting in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recently updated guidance for fully vaccinated Americans, which as of May 13 said vaccinated people could gather indoors without masks and without physically distancing. The people in the video were not ""caught"" violating any mask mandate.

""Fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance in any setting, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance,"" the agency said.
The White House emailed staff the day the guidance was updated to say that those who were fully vaccinated would no longer be required to wear masks, according to reports. CNN reported soon after that 100% of Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate had been vaccinated.
The crowd at Biden’s event also included Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who co-wrote the legislation, and whom Biden thanked in his remarks. 
""The nicest part is being able to shake hands again and to see people's smiles,"" Collins said.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the event was open to 68 seated guests, plus a few dozen staff and journalists. Fact-checkers at Lead Stories and the Dispatch also determined that the video saying Democrats at the event were ""caught not wearing masks"" was missing context.
The Instagram posts are partially accurate — the Democrats were together without masks — but the videos also leave out important details and take things out of context. The Democrats were acting in line with the CDC’s guidelines and White House policies for fully vaccinated individuals.

JB Pritzker","Is Illinois outpacing other large states on vaccinations this month?




If Your Time is short




There are many different ways to measure how states compare when it comes to vaccinating residents against COVID-19.
On some, Illinois ranks high and on others it ranks low when compared with the other nine most populous states.
Pritzker’s office pointed to a very specific metric: total doses administered per capita during the month of February alone.
Illinois took the lead on that metric for a handful of days prior to the governor’s prerecorded address — but the state had already fallen back to second place by the time it aired.




See the sources for this fact-check




Illinois kicked off February with one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, fueling frustration among many over the program’s sluggish start.
Nearly three weeks later, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state was making progress thanks to increased supply from the federal government and the efforts of local health departments:
""As a result, for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country,"" Pritzker said in a prerecorded video address, which aired Feb. 17.
Has Illinois come as far on vaccinations this month as the governor claimed? We found Pritzker's statement was supported by one metric measured over a few days, but glossed over an otherwise spotty vaccination record.
Different measures, mixed results
There are many yardsticks to measure states’ progress getting their residents vaccinated against COVID-19. Illinois performs well on some metrics this month but still ranks low on others.
Illinois started off the month 43rd in the nation for total doses administered when adjusted for population, according to Our World in Data, a University of Oxford-based project that has been tracking vaccine statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the time Pritzker’s address aired, the state had improved to 34th nationally — and sixth place when only the 10 most populous states are considered.
The state is also performing better on a different metric: the share of residents that have received at least one dose of the vaccine. By Feb. 17, Illinois had taken a narrow lead over the other nine most populous states, and it has occupied first, second or third place in that group each day since.
That measurement goes hand in hand with another, though: the share of people fully vaccinated. There, Illinois ranked last among the 10 largest states — and has continued to rank at or near the bottom nationally each day. Experts say it’s tricky to compare states on this measure, however, due to differences in state policies on how much vaccine to earmark for second doses.
Given these mixed results, we reached out to the governor’s office to find out what Pritzker was referencing when he said Illinois was the ""vaccination leader"" this month among large states.
Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said that, per capita, Illinois leads the most populous states in vaccinations administered in February — and has done so ""for the vast majority"" of the month.
Experts said it is fair to compare states based on the total doses administered and adjusted for population. They were split, however, on whether it makes sense to focus on a few weeks in February.
Hemi Tewarson, a senior fellow at the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the February snapshot might be helpful to show recent improvement after a sluggish start because of issues outside state control, such as delays with the federal pharmacy partnership program created to vaccinate those in nursing homes.

""If they started out slow back in December or early January, it's hard to catch up,"" she said.
Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that while month-to-month data is important for gauging a state’s progress internally, it’s not as useful for making comparisons because it doesn’t provide a full picture of a state’s vaccine rollout.
Regardless, by Pritzker’s metric Illinois’ lead among large states on total doses administered per capita in February amounted to just a few days out of the month, based on our analysis of CDC figures catalogued by Our World in Data.
To support Pritzker’s claim, Abudayyeh sent us a screenshot of a spreadsheet containing figures she said the governor’s office had taken from the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination tracker. The spreadsheet compares how many doses were administered from Jan. 31 through Feb. 11 per 100,000 residents in the 10 most populous states.
Those numbers could not be directly verified because the CDC’s tracker only makes available a current cumulative total on each day.
So to check the governor’s figures we turned to Our World in Data again, which makes previous days’ CDC tallies available for users to download. Those numbers matched the governor’s analysis.
Day to day, however, Illinois claimed first place three times out of the first 11 days of the month, hardly the ""vast majority"" of February as Pritzker’s spokeswoman claimed. The state’s lead was narrow, and by the time the governor’s address aired, Illinois had fallen back to second place behind Florida.
So Priztker’s claim was accurate as of Feb. 12, the last day of his office’s analysis. It was not accurate when his speech first aired five days later.
Our ruling
Pritzker said that ""for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country.""

Raphael Warnock","Claim that Ga. Sen. Kelly Loeffler backs ‘getting rid of health care’ partly correct




If Your Time is short





Warnock said that Loeffler wants to get rid of “health care.” His wording offered no specifics on her health care policies or positions.


Loeffler voted to allow the Trump administration to proceed with supporting a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Eliminating Obamacare would take away health coverage for millions of people.


But Loeffler has not proposed getting rid of health care per se and she has proposed alternatives to Obamacare, although critics say some alternatives are less robust.





See the sources for this fact-check




Attacks are going extreme in the two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat who is challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, was accused by a conservative pundit of running over his wife and having been arrested for obstructing a child abuse investigation. We rated the claim, misleading on both counts, Mostly False.
In a lighter response, Warnock used a TV ad to poke fun at attacks on him. ""Raphael Warnock eats pizza with a fork and knife, Raphael Warnock once stepped on a crack in the sidewalk, Raphael Warnock even hates puppies,"" the narrator says, before Warnock makes an attack of his own. 
""Get ready, Georgia, the negative ads are coming,"" a smiling Warnock says. ""Kelly Loeffler doesn’t want to talk about why she’s for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic, so she’s going to try and scare you with lies about me.""  
He’s made the health care attack repeatedly.
This claim exaggerates, but has some truth to it.
Loeffler supports repealing Obamacare
To back Warnock’s attack, his campaign cited Loeffler’s Oct. 1 vote to allow the Trump administration to proceed with its support of a lawsuit that aims to overturn the Affordable Care Act. (The specific measure would have blocked the Justice Department from pursuing the lawsuit; Loeffler voted against it.)
Overturning Obamacare would eliminate the law’s protections for millions of people with pre-existing conditions. The protections include preventing insurance companies from excluding those people from coverage and limiting the premiums that can be charged to older people.
RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs
While it’s possible the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the lawsuit Nov. 10, could strike down the entire law, law experts say that’s not the most likely outcome. Still, the lawsuit’s aim is to repeal the law entirely.

Warnock’s campaign also argues that the lawsuit would eliminate health care coverage for millions of people who are insured through marketplaces set up by Obamacare or through the law’s expansion of Medicaid. 
The New York Times reported that if Obamacare is struck down, 21 million people are at serious risk of becoming uninsured.
Obamacare alternatives not as strong
In addition, Warnock’s campaign cites Loeffler’s support for two measures that would provide health coverage options that it criticizes, arguing that they would result in a loss of health care. 
Loeffler supports allowing for more short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans, which she says gives consumers more options. Those plans are exempt from Obamacare’s protections for pre-existing conditions, however.
Loeffler also backed a controversial Medicaid waiver, sought by Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and approved by the federal government. Kemp contends the waiver will help residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies on the federal marketplace. 
But some 400,000 Georgians who bought individual health insurance plans on the federal healthcare.gov Affordable Care Act shopping website will instead have to work through private brokers or insurance companies., Critics say 60,000 Georgians could be left without health insurance.
Railing against what she calls the left’s efforts to turn health care into a government-run system, Loeffler on Nov. 13 released a health care plan that she says will protect people with pre-existing conditions while offering them more options. It includes the short-term plans and the Medicaid waiver. It does not include the same robust protections that the federal Affordable Care Act has. 
Our ruling
Warnock said Loeffler is ""for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic."" That’s an overly broad statement that could be interpreted any number of ways. 
The facts are that Loeffler voted to let the Trump administration continue supporting a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Millions of people could lose health care if the Supreme Court throws out the law.
Loeffler supports offering health care alternatives, but critics say they are not as good as Obamacare’s provisions.
Warnock’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Our rating is Half True.

President Donald Trump has received plenty of criticism for the timeline of his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Now a Facebook post making the rounds seeks to scrutinize Trump’s actions in comparison to health officials’ warnings about the virus.

The post lists specific dates, saying ""Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9, Jan 14, Jan 28, Jan 30, Feb 10, Feb 19, Feb 20, Feb 21, & Feb 28. He golfed on Jan 18, Jan 19, Feb 1, Feb 15, Mar 7, Mar 8.""
This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
We looked into the claim date by date and found that Trump did hold rallies and go golfing on those dates. But the CDC’s warning said the threat of the coronavirus to Americans was low, and Trump took action against the virus earlier than March 13.
According to online archives of the events page on Trump’s website, rallies were held across the U.S. on the dates listed in the post, including the Feb. 28 rally in North Charleston, S.C., where he used the word ""hoax"" while talking about the coronavirus. 
Trump also went golfing on the dates mentioned in the post. Social media posts and press reports in Palm Beach document visits the president made to his Florida golf course in the first three months of 2020.
The dates when the CDC first warned the public about COVID-19 and when Trump ""admitted the coronavirus might be a problem"" are more ambiguous.
On Jan. 8, the CDC announced in a health advisory that it was investigating a new coronavirus detected in Wuhan, China. The advisory stated that ""no human-to-human transmission has been reported."" As a precaution, it advised health officials to wear an ""N95 disposable facepiece respirator"" if they were treating a patient who had recently traveled to Wuhan and was experiencing respiratory problems. 
The situation summary the CDC posted on Jan. 10 stressed that there were no deaths associated with the novel coronavirus at the time and that the health risk to the American public was low.
On Feb. 1, the CDC updated its advisory and noted that there were seven cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. It detailed how doctors and caregivers should avoid being in close contact with patients who might have COVID-19, especially those who had traveled to China or had been in close contact with known cases.

The Feb. 28 update from the CDC told doctors to assume that anyone with respiratory symptoms had COVID-19, even if they hadn’t had close contact with other patients or traveled to China recently.
It’s hard to put a finger on when Trump ""admitted the coronavirus might be a problem.""
 
RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic
 
On Feb. 27, Trump announced during a press conference that he was putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force. However, in the same conference, Trump told reporters that he didn’t think a widespread outbreak in the U.S. was inevitable, just that ""there’s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse."" 
Trump gave an Oval Office address on March 11, the same day the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic, in which he banned travel from Europe for the next 30 days. He also reminded the public that on March 6 he had signed, and Congress had passed, ""an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies.""
Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 during a press conference with his Coronavirus Task Force. This opened up $50 billion of funding that would be used to ""fight against this disease."" 

 
Our ruling
A recent Facebook post claimed that Trump was warned about COVID-19 on Jan. 8 but  continued to hold campaign rallies and play golf until he ""admitted the coronavirus might be a problem"" on March 13.
While the golf and rally dates are accurate, the dates of the CDC’s first warning and Trump’s response to the coronavirus aren’t as clear cut. 
There was a health advisory issued Jan. 8, though the threat to the U.S. was undefined and person-to-person transmission wasn’t established yet. It’s harder to determine the date on which Trump admitted there was a problem, but he did take specific actions before March 13. Those actions included creating a task force, signing a bill for health research funding and banning travel from China and Europe.

A Senate Ethics Committee investigation found no evidence she broke laws or Senate rules. She said she did not direct the trades herself.


After an outcry over the transactions, Loeffler said that she sold all her individual stock holdings and that she incurred losses as a result.

Warnock was referring to ethics complaints about questionable stock trades by Loeffler and other senators after an early briefing about the coronavirus threat. 
Financial disclosures and news reports show that on the day of the briefing and in the weeks afterward, Loeffler’s accounts engaged in various stock trades involving companies that would be affected by a disease outbreak, and some of those trades helped her make profits, or avert big losses.
Loeffler has denied using nonpublic information to benefit financially, and a Senate Ethics Committee investigation found no evidence that Loeffler violated any laws or Senate rules.

Warnock is the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Warnock is among 21 candidates competing to fill the seat held by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned in December with health problems. Loeffler, an Atlanta businesswoman, was appointed on an interim basis. If no candidate gets at least 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff Jan. 5. 
The race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It’s rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report. So is Georgia’s other Senate contest, which pits Republican incumbent David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff.
Private COVID-19 briefing, quick stock moves
Loeffler’s stock trades during the period before the potential threat of the virus became widely known surfaced in news stories early in the pandemic, and crystallized with complaints made to the Senate Ethics Committee that targeted several other senators as well. 
Here’s a timeline, based on the complaints and news reports:
Jan. 24: Loeffler attended a private briefing for senators from administration officials about ""an emerging public health threat"" posed by the novel coronavirus, just three days after the first case in the United States had been confirmed. 
Jan. 24 - Feb. 14: Loeffler and her husband made more than 20 stock sales amounting to between $1.275 million and $3.1 million. Loeffler also bought stock in two companies, including Citrix, which produces teleworking software. 
Feb. 14: The stock market began a tumble that would take the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 36% over the next five weeks. (It recouped most of those losses over the next several months.)
Feb. 26 - March 11: $18.7 million in shares of Intercontinental Exchange stock were sold on Loeffler’s behalf in three separate deals, among other trades from mid-February to mid-March, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported in April. Loeffler is a former executive with the company, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, is the CEO.
March 13: President Donald Trump declared a national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak as shutdowns began across the country.

March 20: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, filed a complaint asking the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Loeffler and another GOP senator, Richard Burr of North Carolina. Another government watchdog group, Common Cause, filed similar complaints against those two and two other senators, Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma. The CREW complaint alleged that Loeffler violated insider trading laws and the STOCK Act, which bars members of Congress from using nonpublic information for private profit.
June 16: The Senate Ethics Committee dismissed its investigation into Loeffler, saying it ""did not find evidence"" that she violated the law or Senate rules. It did not elaborate. The Department of Justice had also conducted a probe, but closed it in May with no action.
Days after the Journal Constitution report, Loeffler announced that she and her husband would divest themselves of all individual stocks and move their money into mutual and exchange-traded funds.
""I have never used any confidential information I received while performing my Senate duties as a means of making a private profit, she said then. ""Nor has anyone in my family.""
Loeffler campaign communications director Stephen Lawson told PolitiFact that Loeffler and her husband had no role in the transactions.
""She had no knowledge, no control, no communication, none of that"" with the ""third-party advisers"" who handled all of the transactions, he said.
Lawson said Loeffler ultimately lost $1.3 million in the ""liquidation"" of her stocks.
Stocks connected to the outbreak
Asked for information to support Warnock’s attack, his campaign highlighted a number of Loeffler transactions, citing news reports and Senate disclosure reports made by Loeffler. The transactions involved shares of companies that were affected by changes brought on by the pandemic. Some examples:


Loeffler and her husband bought stock in Citrix on Feb. 14 and sold it on April 7, creating a gain of $33,285.


On Feb. 14, Loeffler sold between $250,001 and $500,000 worth of stock in Exxon Mobil from an account owned jointly with her husband, avoiding losses that would occur as the outbreak took hold. The stock then was trading at around $60 per share; by the end of March, it had tumbled to about $31. 


Between Feb. 28 and March 10, Loeffler’s husband purchased $206,774 worth of stock in DuPont de Nemours, which produces protective suits used by health care workers.


Our ruling
Warnock claimed Loeffler ""focused on her own portfolio"" after hearing about the COVID-19 threat and ""profited from the pandemic,"" suggesting that she used non-public information about the coronavirus outbreak to make beneficial stock trades.
Loeffler denied using inside information, and Senate Ethics Committee and Justice Department investigations found she did not violate laws or Senate rules barring insider trading. 
Her disclosures and other news reports show that on the day she received a private coronavirus briefing and in the weeks weeks afterward, there were stock trades made on her behalf involving companies that would be affected by the pandemic, and she benefited from those trades.

Duey Stroebel","Has Gov. Tony Evers banned family dinners amid Wisconsin’s coronavirus pandemic? Yes and no




If Your Time is short





The key here is what Stroebel’s tweet didn’t say – that five of the children he referenced were adults living on their own.


Evers’ order does indeed ban gatherings of immediate family members in different households.





See the sources for this fact-check




It’s hard to find something that hasn’t changed in Wisconsin amid the coronavirus pandemic — work, school, church, home.
On the eve of Gov. Tony Evers’ ""Safer at Home"" order limiting all non-essential movement, a Republican lawmaker lamented the last item on that list.
""Laura, my eight children and I are enjoying our last legal dinner together this evening from our spring break staycation,"" state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, said in a March 24, 2020, tweet.
Evers’ 16-page order — which took effect March 25, 2020 — has sweeping consequences throughout the state, but does it really ban family dinners?
Let’s take a closer look.
Key detail left out
At first glance, Stroebel’s claim to legal limitations within his home might sound off base. The order explicitly makes an allowance for family units.
It says Wisconsinites ""do not need to maintain social distancing between family members in a single living unit or household members."" A later section adds, ""Nothing in this Order prohibits the gathering of members of a single household or living unit.""
 
But it turns out Stroebel wasn’t referencing a single household.
John Soper, Stroebel’s chief of staff, said in an email the senator’s eight children range in age from 14 to 29. Only three of those children live at home, while five have their own residences.
""Governor Evers mentioned specifically ‘dinner parties’ as an activity that must stop under the new Order,"" Soper said. ""Senator Stroebel put out this tweet to highlight that there is no exemption for meeting immediate family (adult children, grandparents etc.), but there is for places like liquor stores and dry cleaners.""

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







That changes the analysis dramatically.
Order bans combining households – even for family
Indeed, there is no blanket exception to social distancing requirements for extended or even immediate family members if they live separately.
Here’s the key line from Evers’ order: ""All public and private gatherings of any number of people that are not part of a single household or living unit are prohibited, except for the limited purposes expressly permitted in this Order.""
Those ""limited purposes"" include things like providing care or transport for the health and safety of someone in another household.
""Large family dinners that include people who do not live together are prohibited,"" said Melissa Baldauff, Evers’ spokeswoman.
She said it’s a requirement that affects everyone, including Evers.
""That’s really hard on extended families, we get it,"" she said in an email. ""The governor’s grown kids and their families aren’t coming to visit him and the first lady at the executive residence right now.
""But that’s the sacrifice we are asking of everyone in this state. Stay home and limit the number of people you have contact with. This kind of distancing is one of the most effective ways of stopping the spread of the disease.""
Our ruling
Stroebel said in a tweet before the stay-at-home order that he was having his ""last legal dinner"" with his wife and eight children.
Though this is technically true for Stroebel’s family, people reading this tweet could well take away that their own one-household family can’t get together to eat. To that extent, the tweet is misleading. 
There’s a key difference between families that still live together under the same roof and those like Stroebel’s with adult children – to the point that Evers’ order allows one and bans the other.
So Stroebel is accurate, but only if you take into account key details that weren’t included in his tweet.

Tammy Baldwin","Yes, Americans pay more for remdesivir. No, Trump administration isn’t to blame for that




If Your Time is short





Americans with private insurance are paying about $780 more than people who live in countries with a national health system for remdesivir, a six-dose treatment for the coronavirus


But the Trump administration doesn’t really have control over the prices of drugs. It’s more up to the industry to dictate.





See the sources for this fact-check




(Editors note: This fact-check was updated on Dec. 7, 2020, to include more detail on the government’s ability to take patents. The new information does not change our rating.)
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin called for change in the prices of a coronavirus drug, placing blame on the current administration for letting the prices rise so high. 
Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) in a Nov. 19, 2020, tweet said Americans are paying the highest price in the world for a drug meant to combat the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to the Trump administration. 
The drug, remdesivir, was the first medication released after the coronavirus pandemic began. It was developed by Gilead Sciences and largely funded with money from U.S. taxpayers, according to a July 23, 2020, article from PolitiFact. 
The antiviral is designed to keep the virus from making copies of itself and spreading. A clinical trial in April found that patients who were given the drug recovered more quickly than those who were given placebo pills, but the study was not clear if the drug improved survival, according to an Oct. 15, 2020, report from the New York Times. 
Attached to Baldwin’s tweet is a Nov. 16 letter to Alex Azar, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requesting information on price negotiations with the company making the drug. The letter is signed by Baldwin, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Tina Smith (D-Minnesota), Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont), Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).  
The senators in the letter request that the federal government take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority, which could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug. 
But is Baldwin right? Is the drug really more expensive in the U.S. than other countries?
And are those prices the fault of President Donald Trump’s administration?
Let’s break down the tweet. 
Remdesivir costs are higher for Americans with private insurance
Americans do pay more for remdesivir than people elsewhere.
In a June 29, 2020 open letter from Daniel O’Day, the chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, said each dose of the antiviral medicine will cost $520 for those on private insurance in the U.S. For the entire treatment, consisting of six doses of the medicine, the cost is $3,120. 
For those on government-sponsored insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid, remdesivir will cost $390 per vial, or $2,340 per treatment, the letter said. That price will also apply to those in other countries with national health care systems. 
Countries such as Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have national health care systems. 
So is the drug more expensive in the U.S.? 
Yes, for people on private insurance in the U.S., the drug will cost more than what people in countries with national health care systems pay. 
That’s similar to price trends with other drugs, though, said Cody Wenthur, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Pharmacy. 
""U.S. drug prices have been calculated to be about four times higher on average than prices in other nations,"" he said.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







Federal government has limited its ability to control drug prices
And what about the claim that the Trump administration is at fault for the price of the drug?
It’s not that simple.
The president does have a small bit of influence, said Edmund Elder, the director of the Zeeh Pharmaceutical Experiment Station within the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy. The secretary of the U.S. Department Health and Human Services is a cabinet member, chosen by the president, and that department does oversee the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And CMS negotiates drug prices for those receiving government-subsidized healthcare, setting a price that can dictate prices for the rest of the market as well, Elder said. 
But the government is still not directly involved, because Congress doesn’t have the authority to tell companies — or the middle-man companies, called Pharmacy Benefits Managers — what to charge. 
""They can’t say you can’t charge more for a drug,"" he said. 
Wenthur said the federal government actually plays little direct role in the setting of prices for the general public because it implemented rules to limit its own ability to influence drug prices. Also, the federal government is only one actor in the realm that sets the prices of prescription drugs. Other actors include health insurance companies, large employers, or other payers, all of which are typically represented by a Pharmacy Benefits Manager. 
But unlike other stakeholders in the process, the government can modify the rules of the system that determines prices, Wenthur said.
""Whenever shortcomings in drug pricing or health care delivery are suggested to be the fault of any given administration, it generally implies that they haven’t been active enough in using their authority to optimize the system itself,"" he said. 
When asked about the claim that Trump could lower prices, Baldwin’s office pointed to the letter, which notes the government could take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority. That could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug. 
""The U.S. government frequently used this authority in the 1960s to acquire lower-cost versions of the on-patent drugs, and has used it to acquire patented military equipment,"" the letter says. ""Some advocates have argued that using this authority could ‘provide adequate supply (of remdesivir) while pushing prices down.’""
That power has not been used since the 1960s and 1970s, according to a 2017 study in the Yale Journal of Law & Technology, though there has been a renewed push to once again rely on compulsory licensing authority due to rising drug costs. 

 
But, in a Nov. 25, 2020 opinion piece in The Hill, Sean O’Connor, a professor of law and the executive director at the Center for the Protection of Intellectual Property at George Mason University, said that by using compulsory licensing, the government would essentially be stealing the patent for remdesivir from Gilead. And while the company would be able to sue the government for full compensation if that were to happen, he said, the government is not authorized to infringe on patents any more than everyday individuals. 
""Ultimately, drug prices are driven more by other factors in the health care system than by patent rights that incentivize lifesaving innovations,"" he said. 
Pilar Ossorio, a professor of law and bioethics at UW-Madison said that while the U.S. government has the ability to ""take"" a patent and begin licensing a drug for production to drive down prices, it’s unlikely it will happen. 
""I think as a policy matter (the government) sees the right of intellectual property as so powerful and useful in the development of inventions,"" she said, that the government would be highly reluctant to take such a step because it would discourage other companies from pursuing their own advances. 
And, she said, because of the emphasis the U.S. has put on the importance of intellectual property rights, there is a chance the U.S. Supreme Court could invalidate portions of the code that allows the government to take patents. 
Our ruling 
Baldwin says Americans are paying more for remdesivir than people in other countries, and the Trump Administration is to blame.
The price element is correct. On average, Americans insured by private health insurance companies could be on the hook for an additional $780 over what people in countries with national health systems may pay. 
But the blame element misses the mark.
While Trump may have a slight influence over drug prices with his appointee to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is really no way for the administration to step in and tell Gilead to charge less for remdesivir without a change in federal laws or invoking a rarely used maneuver to effectively seize the patent from the company.

Nancy Pelosi","Can Europeans get around Trump travel ban by going to England first? Not so simple

It isn’t that easy to get around the restrictions by taking a train linking England and France.

Someone in France who traveled to England would not be immediately exempt from the restrictions.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned whether it made sense for the Trump administration to stop travel from certain countries in Europe — but not the United Kingdom — in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
At Pelosi’s weekly press conference, a reporter asked if she thought the administration’s travel ban was ""wise."" Pelosi said she had spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, and was told it was a ""scientific medical decision.""
""I have great confidence in Dr. Fauci. It's just strange, because they're saying it's because it's easy to travel among these countries. But they're separate from the U.K.,"" Pelosi said. ""Well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K. Again, it's a decision they made. It has its ramifications. We'll see whether it's worth the trouble.""
Pelosi said she wasn’t there to criticize President Donald Trump’s decisions, but emphasized that testing would be ""the only way"" to learn how the virus is spreading.
PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at Pelosi’s comments about travel in Europe and how it relates to the details in Trump’s proclamation.
Trump’s travel ban
Trump’s proclamation seeks to restrict ""all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.""
U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their close relatives are exempt from the ban. So are numerous categories of other people.
The Schengen Area covers European states that agree to free movement among their nations without border checks. Countries in the zone include Austria, Belgium, and France (here’s the full list). The United Kingdom — England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — is not part of the Schengen Area. (Neither is the Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union that borders Northern Ireland.)

When Pelosi said ""well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K,,"" she was referring to the Channel Tunnel (Chunnel is the short name) that runs under the English Channel linking England and France. People move from one country to the other via trains.
However, even if someone gets from France to the United Kingdom, they can’t get on a plane right away and come to the United States, since Trump’s proclamation bars people who had been in Schengen Area two weeks before.
People from the United Kingdom who traveled to a Schengen Area state in the two weeks before their attempted travel to the United States would presumably be barred entry, unless they qualify for the exemptions.
Pelosi didn’t say that a person could cross the Chunnel and then immediately travel from the United Kingdom to the United States, said Henry V. Connelly, Pelosi’s deputy communications director.
""The point is that, with the ease of travel between the U.K. and the continent, there’s not a meaningful difference in risk of the community spread of coronavirus between the two — and thus, not much difference in the coronavirus risk from a person from the U.K. or from inside Schengen Area,"" Connelly said.
Our ruling
Speaking of Trump’s Europe travel restriction exempting the United Kingdom, Pelosi said, ""Well you can just get into the Chunnel, and you’ll be in the U.K.""
It isn't that easy to get around the restrictions by taking a train linking England and France. The travel ban applies to people who were in the Schengen Area 14 days before their attempted travel to the United States.

If Your Time is short



• The federal coronavirus response package will send direct payments of up to $1,200 to American adults earning less than $75,000.
• Each qualifying child claimed as a dependent on income tax returns can result in an additional $500 payment.
• The payments will be based on your 2019 tax return, if it is available. 
 



See the sources for this fact-check




The coronavirus response bill signed into law by President Donald Trump March 27 will send a total of about $300 billion to Americans in the form of direct payments. 
Exactly how much money each person will get depends primarily on their income and the number of dependents claimed on their tax returns. It can be challenging to understand, but if you’re looking for clarity, don’t turn to social media posts as a primary source of information.
One such post is leaving some parents worried: ""If you’ve let somebody claim your kids for income tax purposes, you will not receive a stimulus check. The person who claimed your kids is gonna get it.""
The reality isn’t as simple as the March 31 post makes it sound. Regardless of who claimed your children as dependents, you should still be eligible for a direct payment as part of the $2 trillion COVID-19 response legislation, as long as you meet the income requirements. But determining who will get the $500 payment that is available for each qualifying dependent child is complicated.
The payments
The coronavirus response package will send most single, adult Americans one $1,200 direct payment.
Individuals with Social Security numbers who reported an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less on their 2019 tax returns will get the full $1,200 payment. Married couples filing jointly who earned less than $150,000 will receive $2,400. 
But the payment decreases incrementally as income goes up. Individuals who made over $99,000 or married couples who earned more than $198,000 and have no dependent children will not receive a payment.
Even people who might not normally file income tax returns — including some Social Security beneficiaries — are eligible for payments. 
Anyone claimed as a dependent is ineligible to receive a $1,200 payment, even if they are an adult, according to reporting by several news outlets.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the deadline for filing taxes on your 2019 income has been extended from April 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020. Keeping in mind that many people are still in the process of filing those returns, 2018 filings will apply in cases where the most recent filings are not available. 
Claiming child dependents  
If you claimed a child under age 17 as a dependent, your direct payment will increase by as much as $500 per qualifying child, subject to the income level restrictions.
""Whoever claimed the child on the 2019 return — or the 2018 return if the 2019 return is not available — will be eligible for that $500 additional payment,"" said Elaine Maag, a tax policy expert and principal research associate at the Tax Policy Center.
""Almost all children are claimed by parents,"" Maag said, but there are several legitimate situations in which others can claim children as dependents.

Caroline Bruckner, managing director of the Kogod Tax Policy Center at American University, said a typical example would be children being raised by relatives.
""It’s not uncommon for a grandparent to claim a grandchild living with them, or for an older sibling to claim their younger siblings or even stepsiblings where the parents are absent or deceased,"" Bruckner said in an email.
In these cases, the payment goes to the person who claimed that child as a dependent for 2019.
But Maag said there is still a chance that parents who did not claim their children on their 2019 tax returns could get the $500 direct payment. 
If the parent is claiming the child as a dependent for the 2020 tax year — even if the child was claimed by someone else in 2019 — the parent could be eligible for the $500 payment, according to Maag. In that case, she said, the person who claimed the dependent in 2019 would not have to return the money, and the individual claiming the dependents for 2020 would also get a payment. 
The stimulus aid is considered an advance credit on tax reductions you would otherwise be seeing on your 2020 taxes. (You won’t have to pay them back.) So if taxpayers would qualify for dependent children payments based on their 2020 returns, the IRS will let them claim the payment.
""There’s not a claw-back mechanism,"" Bruckner said. ""Congress is looking to pump money out to taxpayers as quickly as possible to weather this crisis — and they are using information taxpayers provide on their returns to quickly figure out who is going to qualify and how to get it to them as quickly as possible.""
If you don’t claim your children in either 2019 or 2020, however, this does not mean you are ineligible for a stimulus check, as this Facebook post says. For most adults, you could still get up to a $1,200 direct payment as an individual or $2,400 as a married couple, subject to the income limits. 
There are also age restrictions that apply to children 17 and older. Families with dependents who are at least 17 won’t be getting $500 per child payments, and those dependents won’t be getting the $1,200 check, either.
Ruling
A viral image reads, ""If you’ve let somebody claim your kids for income tax purposes, you will not receive a stimulus check. The person who claimed your kids is gonna get it.""
The reality is more complicated.
If you didn’t claim your child as a dependent, you’ll still get a direct payment as part of the federal coronavirus response package, as long as you don’t earn too much to qualify. 
What you won’t receive is the additional $500 that goes to individuals and couples for each dependent child. Instead, that money will be given to the person who claimed the child as a dependent. But if you are claiming a child as a dependent for the 2020 tax year, you become eligible for a payment as well.

David Lewis","NC Republican says Pelosi tried to 'block' voter ID, absentee ballot laws




If Your Time is short



Democrats in the U.S. House proposed a bill that would've expanded absentee-by-mail voting.
A North Carolina legislator tweeted that “Pelosi tried to block voter ID/absentee ballot protections.”
The bill would change NC absentee ballot laws, but his tweet about voter ID is too vague.



See the sources for this fact-check




Since the coronavirus outbreak, Washington officials have offered plans to help businesses and unemployed Americans.
One of those plans included proposed changes to election laws, prompting pushback from some Republicans in North Carolina.
David Lewis, a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, tweeted about a proposal that he says came from Democratic U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
""Pelosi tried to block voter ID/absentee ballot protections,"" Lewis tweeted in capital letters, accusing her of ""playing games."" In a second tweet, he added that Pelosi’s bill includes ""a Voter ID ban and removal of absentee ballot protections.""

Voter ID and absentee ballot laws have been top-of-mind for North Carolina politicians since 2018.
Through a referendum in 2018, North Carolina voters approved the idea of requiring a photo ID at the polls. But the law crafted by lawmakers is on hold because of a legal challenge.
Absentee ballots, meanwhile, were at the heart of North Carolina’s voided 9th Congressional District race that year. The North Carolina elections board scrapped the contest results after witnesses testified to tampering with absentee ballots. (A special election was held in 2019, when Republican Dan Bishop beat Democrat Dan McCready.)
So is Lewis right about the bill he cited? Would that bill ""block voter ID"" and ""absentee ballot protections?""
His tweet is vague and could give the impression that North Carolina’s photo ID law has been enacted, even though it’s on hold. But Lewis has a point that the bill he cited would weaken North Carolina’s existing absentee ballot laws.
Lewis referenced a bill known as the ""Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act."" The bill that doesn’t list Pelosi as a sponsor. But she endorsed the bill and advocated for it when it was introduced on March 23. 
Now let’s look at what the bill says.
Absentee ballots
North Carolina election laws require someone voting absentee-by-mail to mark their ballots in the presence of two witnesses, or just one person who's a Notary Public. 
The U.S. House bill would prohibit states from requiring those signatures on absentee ballots. (You can see this proposal under the ""Promoting ability of voters to vote by mail"" section of the bill, which Lewis referenced in his tweet.)
North Carolina allows ""only the voter or the voter’s near relative"" to return an absentee ballot to the local board of elections. ""Near relative"" is defined as a voter’s spouse, brother, sister, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, mother-in-law, father-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, stepparent, or stepchild.

""Absent from the news — Dominion lost their lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell.""












By Tom Kertscher • June 1, 2021







The bill supported by Pelosi would allow ""any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot"" so long as that person doesn’t receive compensation ""based on the number of ballots"" they collect and return (page 830 of the bill). 
The bill also says states ""may not put any limit on how many voted and sealed absentee ballots any designated person can return."" Collecting large quantities of ballots is sometimes referred to as ""ballot harvesting"" and is what happened in North Carolina’s tainted 2018 Congressional election.
So Lewis is correct to say that Pelosi’s bill would eliminate some of North Carolina’s existing absentee ballot requirements.
Voter ID
This is where Lewis’s tweets need a lot more context. 
Someone reading them might get the impression that the House bill blocks voter ID laws across the country, including in-person voter ID laws.
Lewis said through a spokesman that he was only referring to voter ID as it relates to absentee ballots. But that’s not clear from his tweets. His second tweet -- that the bill includes ""a Voter ID ban and removal of absentee ballot protections"" -- suggests he could be talking about two separate issues.
North Carolina’s photo law is on hold, as we already mentioned. And the bill doesn’t appear to nullify in-person voter ID laws.
""I don’t see any restriction in this bill on any state identification law for voting in person,"" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor, associate dean for research and operator of the ""All about redistricting"" website. He added that he hadn’t thoroughly read all 1,400 pages of the bill.
As for absentee voting, the bill would make ""no-excuse needed"" absentee-by-mail available across the country. While some states require voters to have an excuse to qualify for absentee voting, North Carolina already allows voters to request an absentee ballot for any reason. (So that part of the bill wouldn’t change anything in NC.)
The bill may, however, touch a part of North Carolina’s law that requires absentee voters to present ID. It says states ""may not"" require ""any form of identification as a condition of obtaining the absentee ballot."" (page 821 of the bill)
North Carolina law requires people requesting an absentee ballot to provide their driver’s license number -- or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That requirement is unique to North Carolina and only a handful of other states, Levitt said.
""In most states with an ID requirement for voting in-person and also no-excuse absentee ballots, the states undercut their own laws, which was one of the arguments advocates repeatedly made in support of the fact that the in-person ID laws were more security theater than security,"" Levitt said.
That said, the bill wouldn’t leave states without a mode of verifying voters’ identities. It would require voters to sign their ballots. And would allow states to investigate the vote if the signature on the ballot didn’t match the signature on-file with the local elections office.
""The signature verification, albeit imperfect, is a means of establishing identity, and more rigorously enforced in the election context than the system we use daily for commercial transactions,"" Levitt said.
Our ruling
Lewis tweeted that ""Pelosi tried to block voter ID/absentee ballot protections."" 
The tweet is vague and could give the false impression that the bill supported by Pelosi and House Democrats nullifies an existing in-person voter ID law. That’s not the case.
However, Lewis is correct that the bill would strip away some of North Carolina’s existing absentee ballot laws. We rate this claim Half True.",Tweets,https://twitter.com/RepDavidRLewis/status/1243214994940051458?s=20,null,,null,

Facebook posts","COVID-19 far less dangerous to kids, but wrong to say they ‘are not affected’




If Your Time is short





Most children who get COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms; severe illness is rare.


More than 3.6 million children in the U.S. have tested positive, and at least 297 have died. 


Children can spread the virus to others, even if they don’t have symptoms, which is a key reason for mask requirements in schools.





See the sources for this fact-check




In a viral video clip, a suburban Atlanta mother who implored her local school board to stop mandating masks for children claimed that kids ages 5 to 9 ""are not affected by"" the coronavirus.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Children have been less likely than adults to contract COVID-19, and it’s rare for them to become seriously ill with the virus — but to say they are not affected goes too far.
More than 3.6 million children in the United States have tested positive, and at least 297 have died, according to the latest report from American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association. One reason schools require masks is to try to prevent kids from giving the virus to other people, which can happen even if kids become infected but don’t show symptoms.
Moreover, because adults are being immunized and new variants of the virus are more likely to infect children, ""children are rapidly becoming the major reservoir of COVID in the United States,"" said Dr. Mark Schleiss, professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical School. 
Clip shows woman addressing school board
The two-minute video clip was widely shared by Facebook users, including conservative commentator and Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, who has 4.8 million Facebook followers. She wrote: ""This badass stuck her neck out and said what so many are thinking but are afraid to say! You go girl!!! BURN THE MASKS!""
The clip shows Courtney Taylor on April 15 speaking to the Board of Education in Gwinnett County, outside of Atlanta.
""Every month I come here and I hear the same thing: social-emotional health. If you truly mean that, you would end the mask requirement tonight. Tonight,"" said Taylor, who identified herself as the mother of a 6-year-old student. ""This is not March 2020 anymore. We have three vaccines. Every adult in the state of Georgia that wants that vaccine is eligible to get it right now and everyone one of us knows that young children are not affected by this virus. They’re not. …
""We chose you to make decisions that would be in our children’s best interest, and forcing 5-, 6-, 7-, 8- and 9-year-old little children to cover their noses and their mouths, where they breathe, for seven hours a day every day for the last nine months for a virus that you know doesn’t affect them — that is not in their best interest. And this has to stop."" 
The district requires masks for students, staff and visitors. Students can remove masks during meals; they can also remove them outside when ""social distancing can be achieved.""
""Masks/cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms yet,"" the district says.
COVID-19 among children
Fewer than 10% of COVID-19 cases in the United States have been among children and adolescents age 5 to 17, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In Kansas, one of the few states that provides data by age groups for children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 4% of the COVID-19 cases — 12,325 — occurred among children 9 and under. 
""At this time, it still appears that severe illness due to COVID-19 is rare among children. However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,"" the report said.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Most children who become infected have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, but some can get severely ill, according to the CDC and other researchers. And while COVID-19 presents less risk to children and teens generally — and children under 10 appear less likely than adolescents to become infected — children can get sick and can spread the virus, even without symptoms, according to the CDC.
The CDC is also investigating ""a rare but serious medical condition"" associated with COVID-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. in Children. ""We do not yet know what causes MIS-C and who is at increased risk for developing it,"" the CDC says.
Why children react differently to the coronavirus isn’t yet clear, according to the Mayo Clinic.
COVID-19 and schools
Evidence indicates that ""in-person learning in schools has not been associated with substantial"" transmission of COVID-19 in the community, and that staff-to-staff transmission is more common than transmission from students to staff, staff to student, or student to student, according to the CDC.
The CDC says multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than, or at least similar to, levels of community transmission — ""when prevention strategies are in place in schools.""
As we’ve reported, masks are most effective as ""source control,"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people. 
Respiratory droplets carrying the virus are expelled into the air when infected people cough, talk, sneeze or breathe. These droplets quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles. 
But if an infected person is wearing a mask, it will catch and contain the larger droplets in the humid space between the person’s mouth and the mask. In this environment, droplets take nearly a hundred times as long to transform into airborne particles. So, masks reduce the spread of infectious particles.
This makes a meaningful difference when everyone is wearing masks. If you’re the only one wearing a mask in a public location, it won’t necessarily protect you from being infected. But if everybody is wearing a mask, your odds of infection will go down by quite a bit. 
Public health experts have based their guidance on a variety of scientific studies: systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies. 
Our ruling
A woman in a video clip widely shared on Facebook stated that children ages 5 to 9 ""are not affected by"" the coronavirus.
Most children who get COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms; severe illness is rare.
But more than 3.6 million children have tested positive and at least 297 have died. And children can spread the virus to others, even if they don’t have symptoms, which is a key reason for mask requirements in schools.

If Your Time is short




Along with people 65 years or older and and frontline essential workers, inmates and state lawmakers are currently eligible to receive the vaccine in Illinois.
People with high-risk medical conditions who are younger than 65 and aren't frontline workers still have to wait.
Vaccinating inmates alongside frontline staff and waiting to vaccinate younger people with underlying health risks are both choices that comply with federal guidance, however.
College students as a group do not qualify to receive the vaccine.




See the sources for this fact-check




Illinois’ entry into the second phase of its COVID-19 vaccination plan means many more residents are eligible, but not everyone agrees the state is prioritizing the right groups as vaccine demand still outpaces supply.
In an image shared on Facebook and Twitter, the Illinois Republican Party said Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s ""Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities"" puts prisoners, politicians, and college students into Phase 1B — the current vaccination phase — ahead of ""individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else.""

Like other states, Illinois’ vaccination plan is modeled from federal guidelines, but states aren’t required to uniformly implement the non-binding guidance.
So we decided to take a look at the groups the state GOP claimed are now eligible in Illinois. State lawmakers and inmates are now eligible, but college students are not.
Prisoners and lawmakers can receive the vaccine
Along with people 65 years or older and frontline essential workers, inmates are part of Illinois’ second vaccination phase, which began Jan. 25.
Pritzker is no renegade on this.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons is providing vaccines to inmates, and at least 13 other states have included the group in their first two vaccination phases, according to a comparison of state prioritization plans from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance says states may choose to vaccinate individuals living in congregate facilities — including prisons or jails — at the same time as frontline staff because of the increased risk of transmission in such close quarters.
Pritzker’s administration also added Illinois lawmakers to Phase 1B on Feb. 3 following requests from some members of the General Assembly. The requests came after several people tested positive for the coronavirus during the House’s lame-duck session at the Bank of Springfield Center in January. Both the state House and Senate also canceled session days scheduled for February..
State lawmakers in Colorado, Hawaii and Maryland are also being vaccinated in the second phase. Members of Congress have been receiving vaccines since the distribution began.
Still not eligible are individuals with high-risk health conditions from ages 16 to 64 who are not frontline essential workers. Pritzker recently announced the group will be added Feb. 25, which would make Illinois the 18th state to include them in their first two phases, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation comparison. Chicago and suburban Cook County, which receive doses separately from the federal government, have opted out of the expansion because of supply shortages.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







CDC guidelines say people younger than 65 years with high-risk medical conditions do not need to be prioritized until the next phase of eligibility, Phase 1C. That means the state remains in line with federal guidance.
College students generally do not qualify
There is nothing in the Illinois vaccination plan allowing college students as a group to qualify.
A spokesperson for the Illinois Republican Party said its assertion that college students currently qualified for vaccinations was based on a WCIA-TV report in which a student is seen receiving the vaccine at the I Hotel Conference Center in Champaign.
The report also identifies her as a medical student, which according to the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District puts her squarely into another group that is eligible — healthcare workers.
Spokespeople for the Illinois Department of Public Health and the governor’s office confirmed college students who do not work in healthcare or another position covered in the current phases do not qualify.
Our ruling
The Illinois Republican Party says ""Pritzker’s Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities"" puts prisoners, politicians and college students into Phase 1B, ahead of ""individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else.""
It’s true inmates and state lawmakers currently qualify for vaccinations, and those under the age of 65 and others who are not frontline workers do not — including people with underlying health risks.
But it’s not true college students as a group are eligible. College students may only receive the vaccine right now if they meet other qualifying criteria.
The GOP’s post also ignores how the Pritzker administration’s prioritization plan for inmates and those with high-risk medical conditions is in line with federal guidance.

Tammy Baldwin","Trump administration provides food aid during pandemic, while quietly trying to impose limits




If Your Time is short





The USDA released a proposed rule that would make it harder for states to waive work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.


The rule change was set to take effect on April 1, 2020. The change was expected to cut off basic food assistance for nearly 700,000 people. However, a coalition of states filed a court case to challenge the rule change. 


A federal judge issued an injunction on March 13, 2020.


The Trump administration has filed an appeal of that injunction.  





See the sources for this fact-check




Congress and the Trump administration have approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in four separate measures over the last two months, including extra unemployment benefits, aid to hospitals and loans aimed at small businesses. 
So, this May 15, 2020 tweet from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, caught our attention:
""The Trump Administration is trying to take food assistance away from Wisconsin families when people are out of work and struggling."" 
Is she right?
The evidence 
When asked to back up the claim, a Baldwin staffer pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a lawsuit involving the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the nation’s food assistance programs, including SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The USDA released a proposed rule Feb. 1, 2019, that would make it harder for states to waive work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. In March of that year, 47 Republican and Democratic Senators urged the Administration to withdraw the rule. But on Dec. 4, 2019, the Administration released the final rule.
The rule change was set to take effect April 1, 2020. Prior to the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rule was expected to cut off basic food assistance for nearly 700,000 people. However, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit to challenge the rule change. 
A federal judge issued an injunction March 13, 2020, to temporarily block implementation of the rule change. 
""As a global pandemic poses widespread health risks, guaranteeing that government officials at both the federal and state levels have flexibility to address the nutritional needs of residents and ensure their well-being through programs like SNAP, is essential,"" Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., wrote in her March 13, 2020 opinion.
So that puts things on hold.
And the Families First Coronavirus Response Act -- one of the measures passed by Congress amid the pandemic -- waived the work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.
So, how is Trump trying to ""take food assistance away from Wisconsin families""?

The view from Baldwin’s staff: ""The USDA is continuing to defend the rule change and filed a notice earlier this month that it is appealing the temporary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit."" 
In a May 13, 2020 article from  TIME magazine, U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, chair of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight and Department Operations, labeled the USDA’s effort to continue the case a ""cruel pursuit of unrealistic policy.""
So, while the lawsuit is on hold and work requirements are temporarily suspended, the administration is continuing to pursue the case. If ultimately successful, the change could then remove nearly 700,000 people from the SNAP program.
The response
The USDA pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an April 22, 2020 news release from the agency that noted there had been a 40% increase in monthly SNAP benefits amid the pandemic. 
""Ensuring all households receive the maximum allowable SNAP benefit is an important part of President Trump’s whole of America response to the coronavirus,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in the statement.
The agency cited other food assistance initiatives, including distribution of millions of pounds of food in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The agency did not address the rule change in its email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, but in a May 13, 2020 Reuters article, the agency said it has been ""extremely aggressive"" to ensure food needs are met during the pandemic. 
""While we’re currently in a very challenging environment, we do not expect this to last forever,"" the agency said, adding ""we must prepare our workforce to rejoin the economy when our nation reopens."" 
So, in effect, the administration is doubling down on its position as it relates to the lawsuit.
Our ruling
Baldwin said ""the Trump Administration is trying to take food assistance away from Wisconsin families when people are out of work and struggling."" 
Congress and the Trump administration have launched various assistance initiatives during the pandemic. And one measure specifically lifted a work-related requirement. 
However, at the same time, the administration doubled down on its support of a proposed SNAP rule change that would in effect cut off basic food assistance for nearly 700,000 people -- once an emergency is lifted, and if the agency successfully fends off a lawsuit.

Ron DeSantis","Is obesity a top risk factor in COVID-19 hospitalizations?




If Your Time is short




Research shows that obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalizations.

The research comes with caveats including that the studies are limited in scope and it’s early in the pandemic.


Early research showed that age is the top risk factor.





See the sources for this fact-check




Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis plans to form a task force to look at reopening schools and businesses including gyms.
DeSantis said he understands why there were recommendations to close gyms due to the spread of germs. But he expressed concern that people may not be getting enough physical activity amid the shutdowns.
""The No. 1 group of people who have been susceptible to COVID-19 if you look in New York and some of these other (places), obesity is, like, the No. 1 factor in whether you really get hit hard by COVID-19,"" he said at his April 14 press briefing.
Overwhelming research shows age as the leading risk factor in the severity of the disease, however early research also shows that obesity is a risk factor in hospitalizations for COVID-19. 
That’s a cause for concern in the United States, where 40% of the population is obese. Scientists have called attention to the research about obesity and COVID-19 because it’s another sign that age is not the only factor.
Studies show obesity is a risk factor in COVID-19 cases
We found a few studies that examine the role of obesity in COVID-19. These studies come with limitations, including that they were usually limited to a certain geographic region and may not include complete information on patients, such as outcomes after the study period. But they do provide a useful look at what we know so far about obesity and COVID-19. The studies we saw from New York were not yet peer-reviewed.
Researchers at NYU Langone Health in New York City conducted two studies about obesity and COVID-19, among the largest examinations of COVID-19 patients to date. Most of the patients in the two studies overlap. The studies appear in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases and on the pre-publication website medRxiv. 
One study, led by Dr. Christopher Petrilli, examined the factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 for about one month. Nearly half of the patients were hospitalized. The study found that the strongest hospitalization risks were age over 75, obesity and history of heart failure, in that order.
""Age is the most important demographic factor for severity of disease and more important than any single disease, but obesity is among the most important diseases in terms of risk,"" Dr. Leora Horwitz, one of the authors, told PolitiFact.
Researchers defined obese as a body-mass index of greater than 30. BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person’s height and weight. Normal weight is a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9.
Among the 1,999 hospitalized patients, 33% had a BMI of 30-40 while about 7% had a BMI of more than 40. The rates were similar among those who faced critical illness — as defined by intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death.
""The chronic condition with the strongest association with critical illness was obesity, with a substantially higher odds ratio than any cardiovascular or pulmonary disease,"" researchers wrote.
Obesity tends to increase risk for other conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, which are also risk factors for severe disease with COVID-19.

""Separately, it does seem that the severe cases of COVID-19 have a strong component of inflammation — the body reacting (or overreacting) to the infection to cause severe irritation to the lungs,"" Horwitz told PolitiFact. ""It turns out that obesity itself actually increases the amount of inflammation in the body. So it's possible that obesity also directly contributes to worse outcomes in that way.""
The other study by NYU Langone examined BMI stratified by age in COVID-19-positive symptomatic patients at the hospital. Researchers found that COVID-19 infected patients under age 60 with a BMI of 30-34 were twice as likely to be admitted to acute or critical care as those  at same age with BMIs less than 30. Those who were morbidly obese, defined as having a BMI greater than 35, were three times as likely be admitted to the ICU. 
""Though patients aged <60 years are generally considered a lower risk group of COVID-19 disease severity, based on data from our institution, obesity appears to be a previously unrecognized risk factor for hospital admission and need for critical care,"" researchers wrote. 
In the study, 37% of patients who came to the emergency department had BMI greater than 30. In New York City overall, 22% have a BMI greater than 30, so more people are showing up in the emergency department who are obese, author Dr. Jennifer Lighter told PolitiFact.
A spokeswoman for DeSantis cited a news article in USA Today about a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which examined characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in 14 states in March.
The CDC found that among 178 adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, the vast majority had one or more underlying conditions. The most common underlying conditions in order were hypertension closely followed by obesity. (The other conditions that followed were chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.)
A DeSantis spokeswoman also pointed to an article by Reuters about New Orleans’ death rate from COVID-19. Reuters reported that obesity was seen in 25% of the COVID-19 deaths in Louisiana, according to the state health department. 
A paper about obesity in COVID-19 cases at a hospital in Shenzhen, China found that patients with obesity are at increased risk of complications from viral respiratory infections however, the association with severity of COVID- 19 was unclear. Researchers found that obesity, especially in men, significantly increases the risk of developing severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. 
The study examined 383 patients admitted in January and February.
We sent the NYU research findings to a few doctors who were not involved in the studies to ask if research so far shows obesity is the No. 1 factor in COVID-19 critical cases or hospitalization cases. 
""Not exactly,"" said Dr. Angela Fitch, associate director MassGeneral Weight Center. ""This data shows that in people less than 60 years old, having the disease of obesity increased the need for admission to the hospital and admission to the ICU. Age is still the No. 1 factor so far but in those patients who are younger, obesity is a risk factor for more severe disease.""
The early data across many countries show a link between severity of disease and obesity, said Fitch, vice president of the Obesity Medicine Association. However, further research is needed nationwide and across the world, she said. 
Our ruling
DeSantis said ""obesity is, like, the No. 1 factor in whether you really get hit hard by COVID-19.""
DeSantis didn’t explain what he meant by ""hit hard,"" so we looked at research about COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized. We did not find any study that showed that obesity is the No. 1 risk factor. Most research and evidence so far shows age as the top factor. But early research suggests that obesity is also a key risk factor.

If Your Time is short





Gates has invested at different times in several companies making meat replacement products, including Memphis Meats, which grows meat from living cells in a lab.


We found no evidence that Gates has worked specifically to end livestock production.


Gates has said livestock are critical to fighting poverty. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed grants toward helping farmers get more out of their livestock.





See the sources for this fact-check




Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates is the target of yet another widespread Facebook post, this time for his support of efforts to create climate-friendly meat replacements.
""Bill Gates worked to end livestock production, and is pushing lab grown meat,"" said a May 4 Facebook post.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
In this case, the post is accurate in one way and misleading in another.
Gates has invested in numerous companies working to make meat substitutes using plant-based ingredients and, in some cases, laboratory technology.
But we found no evidence that Gates has worked to wipe out livestock production.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.
Lab-grown meat
News reports from the last several years indicate that Gates has at different times invested in start-ups focused on developing artificial or plant-based alternatives to meat, such as Nature’s Fynd, Hampton Creek, Memphis Meats, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. 
Impossible Foods, for example, makes burger patties that use soy and potatoes for protein. The patties get their flavor from heme, an iron-rich molecule found in meat and plants that sparked some controversy but was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration.
According to the Washington Post, the company’s heme ""is made by taking the DNA from the roots of soy plants, inserting it into genetically engineered yeast and then fermenting that yeast.""
Other companies are even more lab-oriented. Memphis Meats uses biotechnology to grow meat in what its website describes as a four-to-six-week process that involves ""sourcing high-quality cells from animals"" and ""cultivat(ing) the cells into meat.""
""Gates has indeed invested in several non-animal alt-protein companies, including Memphis Meats, which grows real meat from animal cells,"" said Paul Shapiro, author of ""Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World.""

In an October interview with Bloomberg News, Gates celebrated Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat for their plant-based meat substitutes. He said he had invested in both and that their products will contribute to a ""dramatic reduction in methane emissions, animal cruelty, manure management and the pressure that meat consumption puts on land use.""
He’s made similar points on his personal blog, GatesNotes, writing in one post that a rising population requires more food and that farming livestock can take a toll on the environment and require increased deforestation to make room for the animals. 
Livestock are responsible for 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
""Raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact,"" Gates wrote in a 2013 blog post. ""Put simply, there’s no way to produce enough meat for (a future population of) 9 billion people. Yet we can’t ask everyone to become vegetarians.""
""That’s why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources,"" he said.
Ending livestock?
We found no proof that Gates has worked to end livestock production completely.
""He's never said his goal is to end livestock production, and he actually funds some projects to boost livestock-rearing in developing countries,"" Shapiro said. Shapiro cited the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s agricultural development efforts and a news article detailing $40 million the foundation put toward research and projects to breed cows that produce more milk.
""If you care about the poor, you should care about agriculture, and if you care about agriculture, you care about livestock,"" Gates said in 2018, according to Reuters. ""What that means in this context is helping poor farmers get as much as possible out of their animals.""
The foundation has also paid out a number of related grants, according to its website, such as a nearly $8 million grant to the International Livestock Research Institute in November to help ""advocate for investment in livestock development globally,"" among other things.
We searched Google and the Nexis database and found no credible reports showing Gates has worked to end livestock production or said he would like to do so.
On the contrary, Gates wrote in his blog that if he were living in extreme poverty, he would raise chickens. In another post, he said that despite the implications on the climate, ""We can’t simply get rid of soil — or stop growing crops, using fertilizer, and raising livestock.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post said ""Bill Gates worked to end livestock production, and is pushing lab grown meat.""
Gates has invested at different times in several companies working to make meat replacements. Some of those companies are using biotechnology to grow their products in labs. But we found no evidence that he has tried to get rid of all livestock production.

If Your Time is short





The U.S. has nearly twice as many confirmed COVID-19 deaths per capita as Canada.


Leadership is one explanation for the gap. But there are others, including differences in the two nations’ health care systems and New York City being hit hard early in the outbreak.





See the sources for this fact-check




A Facebook post claimed that a difference in leadership explains why the United States has so many more COVID-19 deaths than Canada.
""It’s not that there’s a virus shield between Canada (4,500 deaths) and the U.S. (80,000 deaths),"" the post said. ""What exists is a difference in leadership.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The United States has experienced more confirmed COVID-19 deaths than Canada. But when taking into account the larger population of the U.S., the gap is not nearly as large as the post claims.
While experts say leadership is one factor affecting coronavirus mortality, other factors are in play as well.
Comparing the numbers
The raw numbers come from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford.
As of May 9, the date of the post, the confirmed COVID-19 death toll was 4,569 for Canada and 77,180 for the U.S., or nearly 17 times as many.
But the United States has a much larger population. To account for that, Our World in Data also reports the number of COVID-19 deaths per million people as of May 9: 121.06 for Canada and 233.17 for the United States.
So adjusted for population, the U.S. death toll is not quite double Canada’s.
The U.S. leads the world in overall COVID-19 deaths. On a per-capita basis, it fares better than some countries, but worse than others.
The U.S. is showing a lower number of deaths per capita than countries such as Spain and Italy. But despite claims by President Donald Trump, it has far more than Germany and many other countries, including Canada, South Korea, Iran, Russia, Poland and Switzerland.
But comparing numbers at a particular point in time ""can be very misleading in terms of conclusions — because trajectories over time and the levels at different points in time are very different,"" said health economist Peter Berman, director of the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia and adjunct professor in global health at Harvard University. 
""Canada and the U.S. are not too far apart today, but the U.S. was way higher than Canada some weeks ago,"" he said.
Differences in leadership
The post does not define what it means by ""leadership,"" but there are differences in the ways the two countries’ governments responded to the outbreak.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







At the federal level, Canada supported widespread testing early and the U.S. did not, said Joshua Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""That has been one of the big weaknesses of the U.S. response. It took us a very long time to scale up testing in the United States.
""Provinces in Canada have generally coordinated well with the federal government on how to respond to the outbreak, whereas U.S. states have often taken their own paths and sometimes clashed with the federal government,"" said Michaud, a former infectious-disease epidemiologist. ""That has not helped the response in the United States, if you have that sort of tension.""
Berman said public-health officers in Canada are much more empowered legally, and medical care is largely under the same government authority as public health, so it is much easier to direct and coordinate a response. 
Canada’s politicians, he said, ""tended to cede the podium to the public-health scientists more and didn’t undermine or question them, especially in public. In the U.S., political leaders disagreed with scientists often and publicly.
With the U.S. in an election cycle, Berman added, ""political opposition is looking for things to criticize, as is a politically polarized media. Also, the U.S. seems to me to be a more polarized society politically. All of this has different results in terms of coherence and coordination of policy response.""
News reports have also looked at differences in leadership.
An analysis by the CBC, the Canadian broadcast network, said Trump gave mixed messages about social distancing, and one American study found that people in counties that voted predominantly for Trump in 2016 were less likely to perceive risk associated with coronavirus, seek information or practice physical distancing, the analysis noted. In contrast, according to the analysis, Canadian politicians were more consistent in their messaging, and tracking data collected by Google from smartphones suggested that Canadians practiced more physical distancing than Americans and began doing it earlier. 
In addition to citing Trump’s mixed messaging, the CBC analysis said the U.S. death rate is higher because its largest city, New York, was struck early in the pandemic; and because a lack of health insurance is a problem in the U.S., especially among Americans more vulnerable to COVID-19, such as African Americans.
""Canada has universal health care, whereas many people in the United States do not have health insurance or easy access to care, Michaud said. And, he said, the U.S. has a ""fractured"" health care system, with government providers, health insurance companies and private practitioners ""competing for scarce resources.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed: ""It’s not that there’s a virus shield between Canada (4,500 deaths) and the U.S. (80,000 deaths). What exists, is a difference in leadership.""
These numbers aren’t directly comparable because the U.S. has a far larger population, so the post exaggerates the difference. 
But on a per-capita basis, the United States still has nearly twice as many COVID-19 deaths as Canada does. 
Experts said differences in how political leadership responded to the disease are one factor in the disparity. But there are others, such as the virus’ heavy impact on New York City; poor access to health insurance and health care among people more vulnerable to the coronavirus; and people’s different responses to guidelines aimed at containing the virus.

Facebook users are sharing a post that credits Canada with responding to the novel coronavirus in ways the United States has not. But the post muddles some details of Canada’s response.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021









In sum, the Facebook post overstated the extent of Canada’s school closures, although the situation could change. All 10 provinces have shut down schools for some length of time, but as of March 25, no province had ordered schools closed for the rest of the school year.
Economic support measures
The Facebook post also mischaracterized Canada’s economic response to the coronavirus.
On March 18, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several actions, some of which were replaced in the final legislation, that the government would take to temper the economic burden faced by Canadians.
 
For starters, the government implemented ""a six-month, interest-free, moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans"" and secured ""a six-month payment deferral for mortgages,"" according to the press release.
The government also pledged to introduce an emergency care benefit to provide pay for people who miss work due to the coronavirus and do not have access to paid sick leave. 
The benefit would have provided ""up to $900 bi-weekly for up to 15 weeks"" to Canadian workers who are sick, quarantined, under instructions to self-isolate or taking care of a family member or child who is sick, quarantined, self-isolating or home from school due to closures.
That’s not $950 — nor is it worth the same amount in American dollars — and it would not have gone to ""each family"" every two weeks, as the Facebook post wrongly claimed. 
The emergency care benefit would have applied only to workers impacted by COVID-19, while an expansion of child benefits would have delivered more money to families with children.
More importantly, the emergency care benefit and another proposed benefit for workers facing unemployment were eventually replaced by the ""Emergency Response Benefit,"" which will give $2,000 a month for up to four months for workers who lose their income due to COVID-19.
A spokesperson for the Canadian minister of finance’s office directed us to a press release detailing the new and more generous benefit, which was enacted into law on March 25.
 
The $2,000 per month is roughly the same as $950 every two weeks. But again, it will only apply to workers who lose income due to the coronavirus. It won’t apply to ""each family.""
A government webpage detailing Canada’s efforts to support individuals outlines the emergency response benefit, the six-month moratorium placed on student loans and the flexibility provided to borrowers who need to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said: ""All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred.""
The post is right about mortgage payments and student loans. But it overstates the impact of Canada’s new employment insurance benefits and exaggerates the extent of school closures.

A June 9 Facebook post says the World Health Organization ""now admits that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is very rare."" 
""The claims of asymptomatic transmission was (sic) a major justification for social distancing, the lockdowns, and masks,"" reads the image, which is a screenshot of a text post. ""Everything about COVID-19 hysteria has been a lie.""
Other social media posts have used the WHO’s comments to spin more elaborate ""I-told-you-so"" conspiracy theories about the pandemic, including one that claims it was fabricated. Some claimed the comments show that masks and social distancing are ""unnecessary without symptoms"" and that they were somehow connected to protests after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer kneeled on his neck.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, public health officials have warned that infected people without any detectable symptoms can still spread the virus. That fact is one of the reasons that officials have advised healthy people to wear masks while in public. 
So we wanted to check out claims about the WHO’s most recent comments on asymptomatic coronavirus patients.
While an official with the WHO recently said asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus is ""rare,"" the international public health organization has since walked back those comments — and several of the posts about the WHO’s communication about asymptomatic spread were published after the organization issued its clarification. There is no evidence that the WHO statement was connected to ongoing protests over police brutality, that it shows social distancing rules lack scientific backing, or that the pandemic itself was fabricated.
WHO clarifies comments on coronavirus spread
During a June 8 press briefing, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO technical lead for COVID-19, said that asymptomatic spread is ""very rare."" The next day, she clarified her statement.
Here are her initial comments from June 8, in context:
""We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing. They’re following asymptomatic cases, they’re following contacts and they’re not finding secondary transmission onward — it’s very rare. Much of that is not published in the literature. From the papers that are published, there’s one that came out from Singapore looking at a long-term care facility. There are some household transmission studies where you follow individuals over time and you look at the proportion of those that transmit onwards.
""We are constantly looking at this data and we’re trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward. What we really want to be focused on is following the symptomatic cases. If we followed all of the symptomatic cases — because we know that this is a respiratory pathogen, it passes from an individual through infectious droplets. If we actually followed all of the symptomatic cases, isolated those cases, followed the contacts and quarantined those contacts, we could drastically reduce — I would love to be able to give a proportion — of how much transmission we would actually stop. But it would be a drastic reduction in transmission.

""If we could focus on that, I think we would do very, very well in terms of suppressing transmission. But from the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.""
Those comments appeared to suggest that the WHO was saying the coronavirus can’t really spread from asymptomatic people. News organizations published reports about Van Kerkhove’s statement, with CNBC publishing in a now-updated story that ""coronavirus patients without symptoms aren’t driving the spread of the virus."" 
But on June 9, Van Kerkhove walked back her words in a question-and-answer session. Here’s what she said:
""What I was referring to yesterday in the press conference were a very few studies, some two or three studies, that have been published that actually try to follow asymptomatic cases — so people who are infected — over time, and then look at their contacts and see how many additional people were infected. And that’s a very small subset of studies.
""I was responding to a question at the press conference. I wasn’t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that. I was just trying to articulate what we know. And in that, I used the phrase ‘very rare.’ And I think that that’s a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies. I also referred to data that isn’t published.""
Van Kerkhove went on to say that some models have predicted that anywhere between 6% and 41% of the population could be asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. But she said she didn’t mention them during the June 8 press briefing because they are estimates, not research.
In a June 10 interview on ""Good Morning America,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the WHO’s initial comment ""was not correct.""
""There’s no evidence to indicate that’s the case. And in fact, the evidence that we have, given the percentage of people — which is about 25% to 45% — of the totality of infected people, likely are without symptoms,"" he said. ""And we know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they're without symptoms.""
The bottom line: Asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 does occur. But there’s too much scientific uncertainty to confidently say how big of a problem it is in context of overall spread.
""We’re six months into a pandemic,"" Van Kerkhove said on June 9. ""There’s a huge amount of research that’s being done, but we don’t have that full picture yet.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed the WHO ""now admits that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is very rare.""
Van Kerkhove did say during a press briefing that it appeared to be ""very rare"" for an asymptomatic person to spread the novel coronavirus. But she walked back her comments the next day, saying it’s ""a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare."" Fauci said the WHO’s initial comment ""was not correct."" 
The post paraphrases more or less what Van Kerkhove said, but since it was published after Van Kerkhove clarified her comments about asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus, the post leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Facebook posts","Why your phone has ‘COVID-19 exposure logging’

 


If Your Time is short





Apple and Google have teamed up to create a system that notifies cellphone users when they’ve been exposed to a COVID-19 patient. 


The system aims to help public health officials slow the spread of the coronavirus by limiting the amount of time infected people who don’t have symptoms can unknowingly spread the virus.


iPhone and Android users must opt in to the feature, and personal information like location data will not be shared.


Only a few states have said they will use the technology.

You may have noticed there are new settings on your phone for tracking COVID-19. What’s that all about?
Not an unauthorized surveillance plot, as one popular social media rumor suggests.
""Remember a few days ago when everyones phone was acting crazy?"" reads a June 24 Facebook post, which is a screenshot of a comment on a live video. ""Well they put a covid tracker on every phone. Go look its there on your phone right now.""

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have been shared widely by other Facebook and Instagram users, including a rapper with more than 420,000 followers.
Having a health tracker installed on every Android and iOS device may sound invasive, so we wanted to investigate.

We’re not sure what the Facebook post means when it says phones were ""acting crazy,"" but Snopes reported that a network outage June 15 affected primarily T-Mobile customers.
While there are settings on your iPhone for ""COVID-19 Exposure Logging,"" you must opt in to the feature, which is aimed at helping contact tracers slow the spread of the coronavirus. Few states have said they will use the technology, which comes with a slew of privacy restrictions.
How Apple and Google are helping contact tracers
Apple and Google have created technology to help public health officials. But the subtext of the Facebook post — that the companies are tracking users without their knowledge — is inaccurate.
In April, Apple and Google announced they were building a tracking system for iOS and Android mobile operating systems. The feature, samples of which were released in early May, uses Bluetooth Low Energy signals to automatically send users notifications when they have come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and who has also enabled the technology. Apple rolled out the new settings with iOS 13.5 on May 20.

The feature would work like this: 
Say you’re diagnosed with COVID-19. You have a contact tracing app from your local public health department on your phone, so you report your diagnosis. Then, with your consent, the app uses your phone’s Bluetooth data to find other cellphone users you’ve been in contact with over the past 14 days (which is how long people could spread the virus without showing symptoms). Finally, if those people have consented to using the technology, the system notifies them that they were potentially exposed to the coronavirus.

The tracking system is aimed at helping public health officials conduct contact tracing, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is a key part of reopening the country.

Contact tracing tasks public health workers with learning as much as they can about who a patient has been in contact with so they can be notified about their potential exposure. One way to think about the process is a series of ""disease investigations.""
""That’s like the nickname for them. It’s investigative work — you’ve got to learn everything about this person that you can, and you have to help them recall what they did over the last 14 days,"" Jerne Shapiro, a lecturer in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Florida, previously told PolitiFact. ""This is called ‘shoe-leather epidemiology.’""
Some public health experts have extolled the potential of the Apple-Google partnership in helping epidemiologists quickly track down potential COVID-19 patients. The thinking is that, by limiting the amount of time someone is unknowingly spreading the coronavirus, the number of new cases would decrease.
""Once we have the capability to test as many people as want to get tested, the capability of the human resource side — to put somebody in isolation who is positive, to find out who their contacts were and put them into quarantine — that is your strongest tool to prevent the spread of the disease,"" Shapiro said.
Exposure system has privacy controls
Some social media users and experts have raised concerns over how cellphone users’ data could potentially be misused by Apple, Google and public health authorities. But the contact tracing system has some built-in privacy settings that aim to safeguard users’ data.
First, to participate in the tracking programs, users must install one of the authorized public health apps and then choose to turn on the COVID-19 exposure notifications (which they can turn off at any time). Second, location data is not stored in the system — just Bluetooth identifiers, which change frequently and do not give other users, Apple or Google the identities of their owners.
Finally: ""Only public health authorities will have access to this technology, and their apps must meet specific criteria around privacy, security and data control,"" according to an FAQ about the feature. Apple and Google have said they will shut down the feature once the pandemic ends.
RELATED: Contact tracing: How it's used to fight COVID-19
As of June 5, few states have said they will use the contact tracing system.
9to5Mac, a website that writes about Apple products, polled all 50 state governors’ offices and health departments in late May to see if any were planning to use the technology. Only four — Alabama, North Dakota, South Carolina and Virginia — said they would. Seventeen states said they would not use the system, and the rest did not respond. 
A poll from Business Insider had similar results. Many states told the publication that they intended to rely on human contact tracers. Other challenges facing Apple and Google’s technology: It’s hard to get people to download apps from public health officials, the federal government hasn’t endorsed the approach, and it’s unclear whether Bluetooth contact tracing systems have been effective in other countries, such as Norway.
We reached out to Google for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
Our ruling
A social media rumor claims that Google and Apple ""put a covid tracker on every phone.""
The technology companies created a system that notifies cellphone users when they’ve been exposed to a COVID-19 patient who was enabled the same technology. The system aims to help public health officials slow the spread of the coronavirus by limiting the amount of time infected people who don’t show symptoms unknowingly spread the virus.
But the subtext of the Facebook post — that the companies are using the system to track users without their knowledge — is inaccurate. iPhone and Android users must opt in to the feature, and personal information like location data will not be shared. Only a few states have said they will use the technology to support their contact tracing efforts.
