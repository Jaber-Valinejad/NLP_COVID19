Instagram posts","Instagram post falsely claims COVID-19 vaccines ‘skipped all animal trials’




If Your Time is short





The COVID-19 vaccines available for use in the U.S. are safe and effective. Each was tested in studies involving animals. It’s wrong to say “they skipped all animal trials.”





See the sources for this fact-check




A viral Instagram post claimed that the manufacturers of the COVID-19 vaccines ""skipped all animal trials because all animals were dying."" That’s not true.
""COVID-19 Jab: They skipped all animal trials because all animals were dying and went directly to people,"" said the May 15 post, which was viewed tens of thousands of times.
The post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

A screenshot of an Instagram post falsely claiming the COVID-19 vaccine developers ""skipped all animal trials."" 
The three vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. — the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine — have been shown in clinical trials and real-world studies to be safe and effective at protecting against COVID-19. As of May 17, nearly 123 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, or 37% of the population. 
While the vaccines in use in the U.S. were developed at an accelerated pace, claims that they weren’t tested on animals are inaccurate. Pfizer and Moderna got approval to test their shots on animals while simultaneously running Phase I trials on humans.

""Animal studies were indeed conducted with each of the COVID-19 vaccines in widespread use, even before large-scale human studies began,"" said John Grabenstein, associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition. ""The truth is the exact opposite of the misinformation these rumors are trying to spread.""
Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson all announced results from various animal studies in press releases. The data were also published in academic journals and summarized in decision memos from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the emergency authorization process. The animal studies included tests on mice, rhesus macaque monkeys, and hamsters.
""The most important of these animal studies were highly reassuring, because they showed that vaccinated monkeys intentionally challenged with the COVID-19 virus were actually protected from disease and death, compared to unvaccinated monkeys that were vulnerable to infection,"" Grabenstein said.
The AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in many other countries was also tested on animals, according to fact-checkers in Ireland. 
The FDA lists laboratory research and testing in animals as a key part of the U.S.’s Emergency Use Authorization process. An agency spokesperson pointed to guidance specifying that EUA requests ""should address,"" among other things, ""data from studies in a relevant animal model.""
Chris Magee, the head of policy and media at Understanding Animal Research, a British nonprofit, told Full Fact that if animals had actually started dying during the tests, any Phase 1 human trials happening concurrently would have immediately halted. That was not the case.
Full Fact and other fact-checkers, including the Associated Press, Reuters, the Dispatch and the Journal, also determined the social media claims about animal trials being skipped are false.

When an image circulating on social media claimed ""The Simpsons"" had predicted the coronavirus, we almost wanted to believe. After all, the animated TV show has famously predicted the future a number of times, including Donald Trump’s election.
But other purported connections between the show and real life have proved to be far-fetched. An image from one episode that originally said ""apocalypse meow"" was altered to read ""corona virus."" So, we rated a viral image showing that as Pants on Fire. 
Weeks later, the show featuring doughy Homer Simpson and his family was again linked to coronavirus. This time the link involved Tom Hanks, who announced on March 11, 2020, that he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, tested positive for coronavirus in Australia.
An article the next day carried this headline and referenced ""The Simpsons Movie"":

Laura Ingraham","Ingraham wrongly claims ‘no science’ suggests restaurants spread COVID-19




If Your Time is short





The coronavirus can spread during restaurant dining as patrons take off their masks to eat or drink. Indoor restaurants without spaced-out seating are considered risky.


A September CDC report found a link between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as restaurants. 


A November modeling study published in Nature suggested full-service restaurants are among the types of public places most responsible for the spread of the coronavirus.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News host Laura Ingraham downplayed the risk of contracting the coronavirus while dining at a restaurant, wrongly claiming restrictions on eating out are not supported by science.
""You know what the biggest lie is, is that restaurants are spreaders of COVID,"" Ingraham told host Sean Hannity during the handoff between their TV shows. ""There's no science for that.""
The Dec. 8 comment came after Hannity made reference to Ingraham’s on-air interview the previous day with a Los Angeles restaurant owner. The owner, Angela Marsden, had posted a viral video criticizing county officials for suspending outdoor dining.
Hannity later specified that he was talking about ""outside"" dining in California. But Ingraham’s claim about restaurants was far more sweeping — and more wrong. It’s inaccurate to say that ""there’s no science"" to show ""restaurants are spreaders of COVID.""
""There is a lot of information showing that restaurants are a high-risk environment,"" said Emily Landon, an epidemiologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago.
""Anytime people congregate, there exist increased opportunities for transmission should someone be infected,"" added Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. ""A restaurant is no different.""
Fox News did not offer comment for this fact-check.
Indoor dining is most risky, studies suggest
The risks associated with dining out vary based on the safety precautions the restaurants take and the coronavirus situation in their geographic areas. Many restaurants have become safer over time, but case surges in many states make running into an infected person more likely.
""It’s hard to make universal claims because the pandemic is different in different parts of the country and even in different parts of the state,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. ""In some parts of the country, restaurants aren’t driving cases. In others, they have been identified in case investigations.""
City data in Washington, D.C., for example, has shown restaurants and bars to be among the most common places for virus spread. Data in and around Los Angeles has been less clear.
Still, there’s plenty of evidence that COVID-19 has and can spread at restaurants — and especially at those that let groups of people congregate indoors without masks.
""Modeling studies have indicated that restaurants are high-risk environments for COVID-19 transmission,"" said Jason McDonald, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""In places like restaurants, people remove their masks to consume food and beverages, which increases the risk of transmission.""
One CDC report in September, based on a survey of 314 symptomatic people who got tested for the coronavirus in July, found a link between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as restaurants.

The authors wrote that those with positive test results were ""approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant"" than those who tested negative.
In a November study published in Nature, researchers at Stanford University and Northwestern University analyzed anonymized cell phone mobility data from 10 U.S. cities from March to May. 
Full-service restaurants, gyms and other crowded places accounted for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections, the study’s simulations showed. ""Restaurants were by far the riskiest places,"" Stanford’s Jure Leskovec, an author of the report, told reporters in November.

How COVID-19 can spread in restaurants
Dining outdoors is safer than dining indoors, the CDC says, and restaurants with spaced out tables and limited guests are less risky than restaurants that aren’t keeping patrons apart.
The virus is mostly spread from close physical contact, when people are exposed to respiratory droplets sent into the air as an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, laughs or breathes. 
But there’s growing evidence that infections may have also come from tiny airborne particles, especially in ""enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation,"" the CDC says. Shaman cited one recent study from South Korean researchers that looked at airborne spread in a restaurant.
The researchers examined the origins of one June cluster at a restaurant in the city of JeonJu. They found that, because of the way air was circulated in the restaurant, one person contracted the virus after just five minutes of exposure to an infected diner more than 20 feet away.
Other studies have indicated indoor spaces carry higher risks of spread. The Atlantic highlighted one that showed the odds of transmission were nearly 20 times higher in closed spaces than in open-air environments. Landon shared with PolitiFact a powerpoint created for Illinois officials that listed several other studies, such as one examining an early outbreak on a cruise ship.
Restaurants can reduce the chance of virus spread. Shaman recommended that they minimize or end indoor dining, limit tables and space them out, require waiters to wear gloves and masks, increase ventilation and keep surfaces clean. He also suggested that restaurants take down contact information for those who dine in case contact tracing needs to be performed. 
Our ruling
Ingraham said, ""You know what the biggest lie is, is that restaurants are spreaders of COVID. There's no science for that.""
In fact, plenty of evidence suggests restaurant dining has helped spread the coronavirus. Places that allow indoor dining and don’t follow safety protocols are considered especially unsafe.

Less than two months after signing into law his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which was aimed at providing relief from the coronavirus pandemic, President Joe Biden unveiled two spending proposals totaling more than $4 trillion.
Backlash came in the form of a widely circulated Facebook post that didn’t name Biden, but described his approach narrowly. It made this lament:
""WHY DO WE NEED A $4 TRILLION JOBS PLAN, WHEN A YEAR AGO WE HAD THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY WITHOUT USING TAXPAYERS MONEY?""
The April 24 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post is wrong in three ways:
Biden’s $4 trillion in plans encompass much more than just jobs.
A year before the post — in April 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic hitting hard — unemployment was at a record high, not a record low.
Around that time, President Donald Trump authorized spending of trillions in taxpayer dollars, too. Just before the end of March 2020, he signed a $2.2 trillion bill COVID-19 relief bill.
Biden’s spending proposals
News headlines have referred to Biden’s two plans as a $4 trillion plan, or $4 trillion in plans. Neither of his two blueprints has yet been presented as a bill to Congress.
The $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, presented as an infrastructure program, would go beyond roads and bridges to water systems and broadband, as well as to programs such as care for the elderly and disabled. 
Biden’s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, which he outlined in his first speech to Congress, includes child care subsidies and tuition-free community college and pre-K.

Unemployment and Trump spending
Unemployment in March 2021, the latest month for which figures have been released, was 6%. That’s far below what it was early in the pandemic, in early 2020.
A year before the Facebook post, in April 2020, the unemployment rate was 14.7%. 
That is the highest on record (since 1948), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which cited the pandemic. Forty-three states had historically high unemployment rates that month.
(Estimates during the Great Depression are not directly comparable and are not official statistics, according to the agency.)
Like Biden, Trump authorized spending tax dollars to rescue the economy.
On March 27, 2020, just before unemployment hit its record high, Trump signed a $2.2 trillion emergency coronavirus package into law. 
He also signed a $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill, on Dec. 27, 2020.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, unemployment had been low under Trump. In April 2019, it was 3.6%, the lowest rate since December 1969. 
The lowest unemployment rate on record is 2.5%. That was reached twice, in May and June of 1953.

If Your Time is short



• The posts misread the law. Even if someone receives a bigger stimulus payment in 2020 than their next tax return says they should have received, they will not owe back the difference, much less the entire amount.
• The easiest way to think about it is that the government is implementing a tax cut for 2020 and giving people an advance on what they would have saved next year.



See the sources for this fact-check




Are those $1,200 payments that are meant to cushion the financial blow of the coronavirus just a loan that Americans will have to pay back next year? That’s what a variety of social media posts are saying.
A reader sent us a link to a YouTube video titled, ""Truth About Those Stimulus Checks."" In turn, this YouTube video showed a TikTok created by user @hunnerj9797. (This TikTok has also been shared via Facebook.)
Here’s the transcript of the TikTok:
""This is something I found out today about those $1,200 stimulus checks that you may be receiving with the new coronavirus stimulus package bill. Where am I getting my information? Literally, directly from the bill itself. If you go to 'Subtitle B: Rebates and Other Individual Provisions,' it outlines exactly what you're going to get: the $1,200, $2,400 for the joint, for equal and qualified persons. 
""See, what they don't tell you is this is just an advance on your next tax return. 'There shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by Subtitle A for the first taxable year beginning in 2020.' It even further outlines it is literally 'an advance refund amount.' So that means next year, you're automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season. Guys, stay safe out there. Media and public is not telling you exactly what this bill is.""
At issue are checks being cut by the federal government for essentially every American who doesn’t exceed the income cutoff. 

The amount of these checks (or direct deposits) will be $1,200 per adult and $500 per child under age 17, as long as you don’t have income exceeding $75,000 per individual or $150,000 per couple. This means a family of four would get $3,400. (Above those income cutoffs, you’ll still get a check, but it will phase out by $5 for every $100 in additional income.)
In our analysis of the bill shortly before it passed, we wrote that Americans won’t have to pay taxes on the stimulus checks. Analysts told us that the government is effectively implementing a tax cut for 2020 and giving people an advance on what they would have saved. 
Is that still the plan? When we checked in with tax experts, they told us the TikTok offers a misreading of the coronavirus relief bill. (Admittedly, the legislative language is tough to parse.)
Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said the rebate in the law is a refundable tax credit, meaning that people are entitled to the full amount they qualify for, even if they do not owe any income taxes.

The law also says the credit is based on the taxpayer’s circumstances in 2020. But for now, neither the IRS nor the taxpayer knows how much income they will receive in 2020. 
""So the act specifies that the rebate paid now, in advance, will be based on the information from the most recent tax return filed with the IRS,"" Holtzblatt told PolitiFact. That would be either the 2019 return, if it’s filed already, or else the 2018 return.
Now, flash-forward to early 2021, when a 2020 tax return will be filed. At that time, the amount of the rebate will be recomputed based on the actual 2020 income. ""If the taxpayer should have gotten more than the advance credit paid this year, then he or she will get the additional amount next year,"" Holtzblatt said. 
However, if it turns out that the taxpayer got a larger advance rebate based on their 2019 or 2018 return, the law says that they do not have to pay back the excess, she said. 
To make this more concrete, Holtzblatt offered a few scenarios for a taxpayer who ended up receiving $1,000 this year rather than the maximum of $1,200:
• If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $1,200, the taxpayer will get the additional $200 next year.
• If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $1,000, they get nothing additional and they owe nothing back.
• If the 2020 tax return shows that they should have received $800, the taxpayer does not owe back the excess $200 they received the year before.
Our ruling

Ron Paul","Biden is not advocating a nationwide lockdown




If Your Time is short



• Biden said in August that he would “listen to the scientists” and enact a lockdown if advised, but he later said he didn’t think a nationwide economic shutdown would be necessary. 
• Since the election, two members of Biden’s newly formed COVID-19 task force said the group does not support nationwide lockdowns. 
• After Paul’s statement, Biden said more definitively on Nov. 19 that there would be “no national shutdown.”



See the sources for this fact-check




With coronavirus cases surging again in the United States, all eyes are on President-elect Joe Biden, who vowed to change the course of the country’s pandemic response. 
Biden has promised more vigorous steps than the Trump administration took to mandate wearing masks, improve access to testing and heed scientists’ advice on preventing infection. But former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul declared that Biden’s plans also include a nationwide lockdown, despite recent statements from Biden and his team that it’s not his preferred plan. 
In a Nov. 5 Tweet that became a viral Instagram post, Paul said, ""20 million Americans are collecting unemployment, and Biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate?"" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Paul is a libertarian and former physician who represented a Houston-area district in Congress. His tweet mostly gets the numbers right regarding unemployment aid and the COVID-19 survival rate, with the caveat that the survival rate does not include those over age 70. But for this check, we focus on the claim about Biden’s view on a national lockdown similar to the stay-at-home orders and business closures that many local and state governments have enacted.
Recent statements from Biden and his advisers have created some confusion about his position on a U.S. lockdown: 


In an August interview with ABC’s David Muir, Biden was asked whether he would shut the country down to stop the spread of COVID-19 if scientists recommended it. Biden said, ""I would shut it down; I would listen to the scientists.""  


In early September, Biden said, ""There's going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy. I got asked by David Muir a question, if I was asked to shut everything down. I took that as a generic question if — ‘Am I going to follow the science?’""


On Oct. 31, Biden tweeted: ""I'm not going to shut down the country. I'm not going to shut down the economy. I'm going to shut down the virus.""


On Nov. 12, as cases began surging nationwide, Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden’s newly formed COVID-19 task force, said he believed locking down the country for four to six weeks could help to slow the spread. Osterholm later clarified that his comments did not represent the views of Biden’s advisory team and had not been vetted by them.

After Osterholm’s clarification, a Biden transition official said Nov. 13 that a shutdown ""is not in line with the president-elect’s thinking,"" according to NBC News.


The same day, Dr. Celine Gounder, another member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, said that it is ""not the opinion"" of the group to enact a nationwide lockdown, according to CNBC. She said the task force would prefer a geographically targeted approach to closures and shutdowns. 


Misinformation also muddied the waters: Viral posts circulated in October that falsely claimed Biden pledged to lock down the nation until a vaccine is available. Reuters and other fact-checkers found no evidence that Biden said that.
Daniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, said the basis for Paul’s tweet was Biden’s response to Muir in the August ABC interview, when Biden said, ""I would shut it down; I would listen to the scientists.""
But Biden qualified his answer by saying he would take the advice of scientists — he did not explicitly say in that interview that he ""wanted"" a shutdown, as Paul claimed. And by the time of Paul’s Nov. 15 tweet, Biden and his advisers had provided more context on their current views about a national lockdown.
Biden’s most definitive statement came on Nov. 19, a few days after Paul’s claim. ""I am not going to shut down the economy, period,"" he said in a news conference after a meeting with governors. ""I’m going to shut down the virus, that’s what I’m going to shut down. I’ll say it again: No national shutdown. No national shutdown. Because every region, every area, every community can be different. And so there’s no circumstance which I can see that would require a total national shutdown. I think that would be counterproductive.""
Our ruling
In a tweet that became a viral Instagram post, Paul said, ""Biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate?"" 
Paul’s post mischaracterized Biden’s position at that time, and Biden has further clarified it since.
Biden said in August that he would support a national lockdown if scientists determined it was necessary to curb the disease. 
In October, he said he would not shut down the country or economy. And after the election —  before Paul made his claim — Biden and members of his COVID-19 task force indicated again that a nationwide shutdown is not part of their plans. Biden has come out even more forcefully against the prospect of a nationwide shutdown since Paul published his tweet. 
While Biden’s earlier comments suggest he is open to seeking a lockdown if it’s warranted, he and his team have made it clear that they neither intend nor want to impose a national shutdown, as Paul claims.

Facebook posts","Is Mask Wearing Causing Fungal Lung Infections? No, This Is Another Bogus Claim On Facebook




If Your Time is short





A Facebook post claims people are checking into ERs due to fungal lung infections caused by wearing masks meant to prevent COVID-19.


Regional, statewide and national emergency physician groups say they haven't seen any reports to support this. 


Health experts say there’s no evidence that wearing standard masks, such as surgical masks or ones made of fabric, is harmful to the general public. 


Experts recommend wearing face coverings to slow the coronavirus. 


They also say it’s important to wash your hands and to wash reusable masks regularly.





See the sources for this fact-check




A widely-circulated Facebook post claims people are checking into emergency rooms with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks to prevent COVID-19. 
""People are starting to enter ERs with fungal lung infections from wearing masks!! Take breaks from your masks."" 
The claim, posted on July 2, had been shared 16,000 times and viewed nearly 700,000 times over the past 24 hours. 
It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook).
With more states requiring face coverings in public settings, and lots of false claims spreading about masks, we wanted to know whether there’s any truth to this provocative statement. 
We set out on a fact check.
Misinformation About Masks
This is far from the first social media post to claim that wearing masks is harmful to your health. In June, PolitiFact National debunked the multi-part allegation that claimed wearing masks for the coronavirus ""decreases oxygen intake, increases toxin inhalation, shuts down immune system"" and ""increases virus risk."" It rated the claim False. 
In May, PolitiFact rated False a similar claim that wearing a mask causes health problems, particularly from breathing in too much exhaled carbon dioxide.
It found there’s no credible data to back that up. ""Experts say prolonged use of N95 respirator masks can increase blood CO2 levels for people with breathing problems, but those masks are not recommended for the general public, and using ordinary cloth or surgical masks poses little or no risk from CO2,"" PolitiFact reported. 
Fungal Infections?
With those fact checks in mind, we examined whether people are truly showing up at ERs with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks. We reached out to regional, statewide and national experts and found no supporting evidence. 
""Neither the chair of our emergency department nor the head of our infectious diseases division have seen that type of condition in a patient after an individual has been using a face mask,"" a spokesperson for UC Davis Health in Sacramento wrote in an email. 
After looking into the claim, Elena Lopez-Gusman, executive director of the California chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, called it ""as suspected, false."" 
Finally, the national American College of Emergency Physicians told us they’ve seen no evidence supporting the claim. 
""While we’ve heard some folks complain about irritation, we have not heard of reports of fungal infections stemming from masks,"" Maggie McGillick, a spokesperson for ACEP wrote in an email. ""There are several professions where people wear masks for hours on end without issue.""
The College released a statement last week encouraging people to cover their face when in public.

‘Recycled breathing’ not a real danger
Taking a closer look at the Facebook post in question, some commenters wondered whether wearing a mask for hours on end might be harmful, while wearing it for just a short while might not be. 
In an email, McGillick of ACEP addressed that concern: ""There is not a real danger to breathing in your own air or ‘recycled breathing,’ nor is the idea of low oxygen or carbon dioxide buildup a concern. However, there could be risk from someone’s mask getting contaminated from others and then transferring that to your mouth/eyes/etc. when you touch your own mask.""
The spokesperson stressed that it’s important to avoid touching your face and to wash your hands before and after touching your mask.
Some commenters on the Facebook post in question said they worried about the health effects of wearing masks. Yet others said they were skeptical of the claim given that doctors, nurses, mechanics and others wear masks for a prolonged period and don’t come down with fungal lung infections. 
One medical professional jumped into the comments with her own fact check: ""It isn’t happening. I’m an ER nurse. This is not true at all."" 
Sanitary Tips For Mask Wearing
Earlier this month, the health information website MedicalNewsToday fact-checked a similar claim and found there ""is no evidence indicating that masks increase the wearer’s risk of developing pneumonia or other bacterial, viral, or fungal lung infections."" 
It also included guidance from leading health organizations for how to safely handle your mask. It found the World Health Organization acknowledges ""that if a person wears the same mask for a long time, microorganisms may grow on the fabric."" 
""All masks should be changed if wet or visibly soiled; a wet mask should not be worn for an extended period of time. ... Either discard the mask or place it in a sealable bag where it is kept until it can be washed and cleaned,"" the WHO advises.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends ""that a person removes the face covering once they return home and washes it before using it again,"" the MedicalNewsToday article also noted. 
Our ruling 
A popular Facebook post alleges people are checking into ERs with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks to prevent the coronavirus.
Regional, statewide and national emergency physicians groups said there’s no evidence to back up this claim. 
Medical experts recommend wearing face coverings to slow the transmission of COVID-19 and say the effects of wearing the coverings are not harmful. 
They also encourage people to wash their hands and their masks on a regular basis to avoid contamination. 
This claim about mask-wearing leading to fungal lung infections is bogus.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump wrong to say U.S. has “one of the lowest mortality rates in the world” from COVID-19




If Your Time is short



• The United States doesn’t have one of the world’s lowest mortality rates from the coronavirus. No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India.
• Another measurement called the case-fatality rate, which Trump incorrectly referred to as the “mortality rate,” also doesn’t place the United States at or near the bottom internationally.



See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump defended his performance in fighting the coronavirus during an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace, insisting that the mortality rate from COVID-19 in the United States is among the world’s lowest.
In the interview that aired July 19, Wallace and Trump were in the middle of a discussion about the coronavirus’ impact. Wallace said that ""we have the seventh-highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban.""
Trump responded that ""when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.""
When Wallace fact-checked that characterization, Trump doubled down: ""I heard we had the best mortality rate. Number one low mortality rate.""
Trump is wrong.
Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to an inquiry for this article. 
Comparing international mortality rates
Scientists define ""mortality rate"" as a measure of how frequently death occurs within a defined population. Data on this question is imperfect because of reporting inconsistencies between and even within countries. We turned to widely cited coronavirus data compiled by Johns Hopkins University to analyze Trump’s assertion.
Specifically, we looked at the university’s calculations of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 in population, which is a standard measurement of mortality rate.
First, we compared the United States with other nations that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus. To do this, we looked at all nations that have recorded at least 100,000 confirmed cases.

 
The United States has the sixth-highest mortality rate using this metric, behind the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France.
But 16 hard-hit nations had a lower mortality rate: Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran, Colombia, Germany, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Argentina, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
We also looked at how the United States compared with its peers among advanced industrialized nations. 

 
In this comparison, six countries had higher mortality rates than the United States: Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and France.

But 15 countries had lower mortality rates than the United States: Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Finland, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
By neither comparison is Trump close to correct.
Mortality rate is strongly related to the age distribution in a country, said Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.
""The countries with the lowest mortality rates will probably end up being the ones with the younger population age structures,"" she said.
Another measurement
When ""Fox News Sunday"" aired the interview, Wallace said the White House had been referring to the ""case-fatality rate"" rather than the mortality rate. (White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany handed Trump a paper chart citing ""case-fatality rate"" during the interview.)
The case-fatality rate is not the same as the mortality rate. The case-fatality rate shows how likely you are to die from the coronavirus if you are infected with it. The mortality rate shows how common it is to die of coronavirus in a particular population, such as a country.
Trump’s point about the U.S. is not more accurate when looking at the case-fatality rate compared with other countries.

 
Nine countries have a higher case-fatality rate than the United States. One country, Peru, has an equal rate and 11 have a lower rate: Colombia, Chile, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
Nichols said that the younger populations of many developing countries helps explain why their case-fatality rates are lower than that of the United States. (Infected patients who are younger and, often, healthier tend to die at lower rates from the coronavirus.)
And when you compare the United States with its industrialized peers, seven countries have a lower case-fatality rate: Austria, Portugal, Norway, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Australia.

 
Nichols said that the U.S ranks relatively low on this measure because, despite its problems rolling out testing, it still handles more tests per capita than most other comparable countries.
Our ruling
Trump said, ""We have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world"" from coronavirus.
The United States doesn’t have one of the world’s lowest mortality rates from the coronavirus: No fewer than 15 advanced, industrialized nations currently have a lower mortality rate, as do a host of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, and India.

Debate ensued among players and others about whether the game should be played in 2021. 
But the NBA announced Feb. 18 that the 2021 game would be held March 7 in Atlanta — it would be limited, however, to one evening inside the arena hosting the game, rather than a weekend of events at various venues. 
""For the well-being and safety of the greater Atlanta community, there will be no fan activities, ticketed events or hospitality functions,"" the league said.
Bottoms issued orders after the pandemic emerged in March 2020 that temporarily shut down bars and nightclubs that do not serve food, gyms and fitness centers, movie theaters, live performance venues, bowling alleys, arcades and private social clubs, and that ordered residents to stay in their homes.
Bottoms issued her statement about the All-Star Game on Feb. 16, two days before the NBA made its announcement. She made it clear she didn’t want any public gatherings associated with the game, but didn’t order any shutdowns. She said: 
""Under normal circumstances, we would be extremely grateful for the opportunity to host the NBA All-Star game, but this is not a typical year. I have shared my concerns related to public health and safety with the NBA and Atlanta Hawks.

""Hydroxychloroquine cures this ‘virus,’"" reads the text post, which was published May 14 in an anti-vaccine group targeting billionaire Bill Gates. ""It just so happens this is the treatment used for radiation sickness!!""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Since President Donald Trump first touted the drug as a potential coronavirus treatment during a March press briefing, we have fact-checked dozens of claims about hydroxychloroquine, which has previously been used for treating malaria and inflammatory disorders such as lupus and arthritis. Seeing as Trump is now taking the drug to lessen symptoms in case he is sickened with COVID-19, we figured we should check this post, too.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
The post is inaccurate. We reached out to the original poster for their sources, but we haven’t heard back.
There is no cure or vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Some studies have found that hydroxychloroquine could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, but the research is not conclusive.
Two studies, one from France and one from China, found that hydroxychloroquine helped people clear the virus quickly and alleviate symptoms. But two other studies found that the drug had no discernible effect on the coronavirus. A more recent, large-scale study of nearly 1,400 New York-area patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 also found that patients fared no better by taking hydroxychloroquine.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







With more than 50 studies in the works, as well as a clinical trial from the National Institutes of Health, it’s too soon to say whether hydroxychloroquine is a viable treatment for the coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration has warned that the drug’s use outside of hospitals could contribute to heart rhythm problems.
The Facebook post’s claim about radiation sickness is also inaccurate.
Hydroxychloroquine is not listed by the CDC or the Mayo Clinic as a treatment for radiation sickness, which is caused by a large dose of radiation over a short period of time. The condition is treated by removing radioactive particles outside the body or using substances like potassium iodide to reduce damage to internal organs.
RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know
Why is radiation sickness mentioned in the post? It has to do with recurring conspiracy theories about 5G, Gates and Dr. Anthony Fauci — all of which are popular among anti-vaccine groups on Facebook.
For months, conspiracy theorists and alternative health practitioners have claimed that 5G data networks, the latest upgrade to speed up wireless internet connections, could have adverse health effects. Some experts are concerned about the potential effects of the millimeter waves used in 5G technology, but there is no evidence that they cause radiation sickness.
""To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies,"" the World Health Organization wrote in February.
Both Gates and Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have tempered expectations for hydroxychloroquine and stressed the importance of developing a coronavirus vaccine. Those views have fueled conspiracy theories, widely shared in anti-vaccine groups, about both men’s connections to the pharmaceutical industry.

Facebook posts","No, emails to Fauci don’t show early agreement that virus was man-made




If Your Time is short





One email to Fauci from a credible researcher noted the possibility of an engineered virus, but said more work was needed.


Other emails came from less credible voices and cited no evidence.





See the sources for this fact-check




The release of thousands of emails to and from U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci has fueled claims that the virus behind COVID-19 was man-made. BuzzFeed and the Washington Post received the emails in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, and both published articles on June 1.
Fauci’s critics quickly responded.
""Dr Fauci exposed for the fraud he is,"" said a June 2 Facebook post from the WTF Files. ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured."" 
The post included an email from Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. It underlines last few words of this quote from his Jan. 31, 2020, message to Fauci: ""The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all of the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered.""
A smoking gun?
No.
In that same email, Andersen said, ""There are still further analyses to be done, so those opinions could still change.""
And a little over a month later, they did.
In a March 17, 2020, article in Nature Medicine, Andersen and his colleagues wrote, ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.""

After the email release, Andersen tweeted June 1 that ""we seriously considered a lab leak a possibility,"" and ""what the email shows, is a clear example of the scientific process.""
The WTF Facebook post includes another email to Fauci from a professor of dermatology who voiced his suspicion that the virus could have been released from a lab in Wuhan. The email gives no data to support that suspicion.
Plucking emails from the BuzzFeed and Washington Post trove inspired other social media posts suspicious of Fauci.
Instagram posts drew attention to an email to Fauci from independent researcher Adam Gaertner. In one June 2 post, the email’s subject line, ""Coronavirus bioweapon production method,"" and the phrase ""This is how the virus was created"" are underlined in red.
But despite Gaertner’s use of technical terms, including ""adjusted virions"" and  ""conformational rearrangements,"" the email contains no evidence to prove the point. Gaertner has appeared on web programs that link vaccines to the creation of superspreaders, and he promotes the use of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin to treat COVID-19. Some studies find ivermectin effective in treating COVID-19; others have found no impact.
One Instagram user who shared the image posted an update saying, ""Just to be clear this email appears to have been sent to Fauci through public inquiry, so it doesn't necessarily link Fauci to anything.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post says, ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""
The only email that came close to matching that claim noted that while some evidence suggested the virus might be man-made, more work was needed and that opinion could change. The email presented a possibility — a starting point for more research — not a conclusion. The man who wrote that email concluded that the virus developed naturally in a scientific journal article in March 2020.
We rate this claim False.

Facebook posts","To fight COVID-19, CDC now says wear masks in public




If Your Time is short





A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.


That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3.


Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump has said he can’t see himself wearing one. Vice President Mike Pence didn’t when he visited the Mayo Clinic.
But generally, when it comes to protecting against the coronavirus, who should wear a face mask?
A widely shared Facebook post appears to offer direction from an authoritative source, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
""Please note: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19,"" says what looks like a partial screenshot from a UPMC web page. ""Face masks should be worn by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This post, published April 27, is offering old advice. 
The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.
The old advice
Early in the coronavirus outbreak, the CDC’s guidance did deter people from wearing face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. ""This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected,"" the guidance stated.
But that changed.
The new advice
Trump announced April 3, weeks before this Facebook post, that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. 
The CDC said it was making the change based on continuing studies that found that the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic and that even those who eventually develop symptoms can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.













By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







In a question-and-answer posting about cloth face coverings, the CDC broadly recommended their use in public settings where six-feet distancing is more difficult to maintain. 
The new guidance does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the Facebook post did.
The CDC said:


People should ""wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting,"" including grocery stores and pharmacies, and especially in public in areas of widespread COVID-19 illness.


Cloth face coverings can be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials. Surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.


A cloth face covering ""is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected, but does not have symptoms.""


Cloth face coverings should not be placed on children younger than 2 years of age, ""anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance.""


The homemade masks that are best
The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearer’s face.
""Given the current crisis, and lacking an alternative, many layers of densely woven fabric would be the most effective, because it allows for lots of voids in the layers where particles can be trapped,"" Richard Peltier, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, previously told PolitiFact. ""The mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks, though this may not be possible with different designs, fabrics, or face shapes. Thin or porous fabrics are the least likely to be effective.""
Cloth masks, he added, ""should be treated as contaminated materials that you bring in to your home — they need to be laundered in hot soapy water, and you’d need to consider sanitizing in bleach or hydrogen peroxide regularly.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post reflects outdated information in claiming that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.

Facebook posts","No, the coronavirus did not cause the death rate to drop in Chicago




If Your Time is short




A Facebook post shared over 2,000 times claimed that COVID-19 lowered the death rate in Chicago.
But an analysis of cases from the Cook County Medical Examiner suggests the opposite.
Deaths in Chicago increased in March 2020 compared to previous years, despite a decline in murders.




See the sources for this fact-check




As the coronavirus forces people across the country to stay indoors, questions have emerged over how the pandemic is impacting crime rates. 
It’s a debate of particular significance to cities like Chicago, which is accustomed to high levels of violent crime. As of April 1, 2020, the virus sickened over 3,000 people in Chicago and killed 39 — even as Illinois officials attempt to contain the spread through a stay-at-home order. 
But a March 22, 2020, Facebook post that accumulated more than 2,200 shares took it one step further.
""In Chicago, Covid-19 actually LOWERED the death rate,"" the post stated, over a background of laughing emojis.
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Murders in Chicago decreased in March 2020 compared to years prior, but officials have yet to attribute that shift to COVID-19. 
And overall, deaths don’t appear to be declining.
Death rates in Chicago
The first case of COVID-19 arrived in Illinois in January after a 60-year-old Chicago woman returned from Wuhan, China — where the virus originated — but like many states did not see a surge in cases until March. Illinois reported its first death on March 17, a patient who was a Chicago resident.
The most recent available numbers on deaths in Chicago come from the Cook County Medical Examiner, which takes cases that require additional investigation to determine a cause of death. If someone was under the care of a doctor when they died, that case wouldn’t necessarily go to the medical examiner because the doctor can sign off on their death certificate.
So it’s important to note that information from the medical examiner doesn’t encompass all deaths in Chicago. But it does provide a valuable snapshot.
The examiner’s office handled 413 deaths in Chicago in March, according to its case archive as of April 2. At least 11 of them were tied to COVID-19, while other causes of death ranged from gunshot wounds to cardiovascular disease.

In March 2019, by comparison, the medical examiner saw 279 deaths in Chicago. There were 301 Chicago cases in March 2018 and 306 in March 2017.
These numbers show the virus doesn’t appear to be decreasing deaths as the Facebook post suggested. Instead, officials say it's likely the opposite.
""The uptick you are seeing is a direct correlation to the rise in COVID-19 cases,"" said Natalia Derevyanny, director of communications for the Cook County Bureau of Administration.
The homicide question
Chicago sees high rates of gun violence largely tied to gang conflict. Given its reputation, this Facebook post implies that the virus is ultimately saving lives because people are inside and not on the streets.
The poster did not respond to a request for comment.
According to the Chicago Police Department, the city saw 24 homicides in March, a decrease from 35 in March of last year. But shootings and shooting victims for the month jumped roughly 6% and 5%, respectively.
The department declined to say whether it attributes the decrease in homicides to COVID-19.
According to the Chicago Tribune, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been hesitant to draw a line between the virus and crime.
""We can’t specifically say that the crime rate is affected by coronavirus,"" Lightfoot said. ""But obviously what we know going back many, many years and looking at data is that when large congregations of people are outside in neighborhoods where gun violence is prevalent, that increases the risk.""
A footnote: In Milwaukee — another city plagued by gun violence — there were more homicides in March 2020 than March 2019, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s homicide tracker.
Our ruling
A Facebook post shared by more than 2,000 people claimed that in Chicago, COVID-19 has lowered the death rate.
But numbers from the Cook County Medical Examiner do not indicate that deaths in Chicago decreased in March as COVID-19 started to ravage Illinois. In fact, the data suggest the opposite — more deaths, despite a decrease in murders reported by Chicago police.

Instagram posts","There’s no proof that COVID-19 vaccine has injured or killed more than 900 children




If Your Time is short




The data in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System are not verified, and cannot be used on their own to show that vaccines caused negative health effects.




See the sources for this fact-check




Two weeks after Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was cleared for use in adolescents, newly reported clinical trial results show Moderna’s vaccine is also highly effective for 12- to 17-year-olds, a hopeful sign for parents who are eager to get their kids vaccinated before school starts in the fall.
But an Instagram post  suggests that parents ought to be worried about the safety of the vaccines in children.
The post includes a graphic that reads, ""The latest CDC data show reports of adverse events from COVID vaccines surpass 220,000, including 943 among 12-17 year olds."" 
The user who posted the image wrote in the caption, ""I can’t help but to focus on the fact that 943 innocent kids whose parents believed that they were doing the right thing to protect their children — thanks to the propaganda packaged as science — are now injured or dead.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
So far, there’s no hard proof of anyone in the U.S. — adults or children — having died as a result of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Three people have died from a rare blood clotting issue that health officials have said could be linked to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which hasn't been approved for children.
This graphic attributes adverse-event data to the CDC, apparently referring to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a public data collection tool run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. 
The agencies and other medical researchers use the system to monitor adverse events — or possible side effects — following a vaccine that may warrant further study. For example, the CDC is currently investigating 18 cases of heart inflammation in teens and young adults, out of 164 million people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine.
VAERS is designed so that any person can report an adverse event, and anyone can scour the reports. 
But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a dangerous breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere. For more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful.

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







The agencies that run VAERS warn that its reports cannot be used on their own to show whether a vaccine caused certain adverse events. So the events cited in the Instagram post are not evidence that anyone died or was injured because of the vaccine.
We took a look at the numbers given in the claim, and checked them against what’s in VAERS. 
As of the last weekly update on May 21, VAERS shows 227,612 total reported events for all age groups for the COVID-19 vaccines. 
We then ran a narrower search for the 6-to-17 age group, which would include the 12- to 17-year-olds now eligible for vaccination. VAERS turned up 2,207 reported events, not 943. 
But that number does not represent the number of people who died or were injured, as the Instagram post claims. It is just the number of reports entered into the database.
Under the symptoms listed in those event reports, for example, ""No Adverse Event"" occurs 400 times. Many of the reports detail people experiencing the known side effects of the vaccine: headache, soreness, fever and fatigue, which are temporary and treatable with recommended over-the-counter medication. 
A search that included just serious adverse events — a category that includes death, life-threatening events, and events that involve hospitalization — turned up 46 reports of events for the 6-to-17 age group. Three reported events cited a death. Each of these reports requires investigation and doesn’t signify a confirmed event related to the vaccine.
So the numbers in the claim don’t align with what’s in VAERS. But more than that, VAERS reports don’t indicate whether any deaths or injuries are caused by the vaccines. Researchers would need more studies and data to determine that.
Our ruling
An Instagram post claims that 943 children and teens have been injured or killed because of the COVID-19 vaccine. The post cites data from the government’s VAERS tool to back up this claim.
For the 6-to-17 age group, a search of the VAERS tool turns up 46 reports of serious adverse events after a COVID-19 vaccination. But the agencies that maintain VAERS warn that the reports should not be used to draw conclusions about whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event.
There is no hard proof so far of anyone in the U.S. having died as a result of getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

Warren Daniel","No evidence that Mandy Cohen threatened to withhold PPE from NC hospitals




If Your Time is short




The legislator says he got his information from a representative for the NC Healthcare Association. 
The NCHA rep says she heard about the potential ultimatum from a health department staffer, who she declined to identify.
The health department denies Daniel's claim and says the NCHA's rep likely misunderstood their staffer. Hospitals told PolitiFact they never heard of the alleged plan.




See the sources for this fact-check




A North Carolina legislator claims that the state health department threatened to withhold equipment from hospitals if they resumed elective procedures.
But the health department has denied the claim, and PolitiFact could not confirm that the ultimatum was ever seriously considered or even communicated to hospitals.
Mandy Cohen, secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, requested on March 23 that hospitals suspend non-urgent procedures.
The goal was to prevent unnecessary human contact, ensure COVID-19 patients got the care they needed, and preserve the state’s limited supply of protective equipment. 
At the same time, halting elective procedures meant hospitals lost out on revenue generated from those procedures. So it makes sense that they’d want to resume them.
This is where state Senator Warren Daniel comes in. Daniel, a Republican from western North Carolina, tweeted on April 23 that hospitals might be punished if they choose to resume those procedures.
""It’s being reported that NC DHHS is telling hospitals that if they decide to do elective surgeries, they won’t be eligible to receive PPE from the state,"" Daniel tweeted, referring to personal protective equipment.
He suggested the alleged threat was contrived by Cohen. Aside from Gov. Roy Cooper, Cohen has been perhaps the state’s most visible government official during the pandemic.
Daniel referred to the decision as ""The heavy hand of government,"" adding: ""I hope Secretary Cohen will reverse course.""

When PolitiFact reached out to Daniel, he said he got the information from the N.C. Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals across the state.
Conversation with a staffer
Daniel said the association ""reported to legislators last week that DHHS told them if hospitals began offering elective surgeries again, then the state would not give them additional PPE."" He added: ""When I heard that I was shocked and thought it was something the public deserved to know.""
We reached out to the NC Healthcare Association and were referred to Leah Burns, the group’s senior director of government relations.
""I had a conversation with a staffer at DHHS where this notion was discussed that PPE would potentially be withheld from hospitals if hospitals began elective surgeries,"" Burns said. She declined to identify the DHHS staffer she spoke with.
""After my conversation with the DHHS staffer, I spoke with a legislative staffer about it. Since then, this idea has not come to fruition, and I do not believe DHHS is withholding PPE from any hospitals in North Carolina,"" Burns said. She declined to identify the legislative staffer she spoke with.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Eight days after Daniel’s tweet, on May 1, DHHS offered guidance to hospitals on how they could resume elective procedures. That letter mentions the lack of PPE across the state, stating: ""If appropriate PPE is unavailable to protect the health care worker or the supply of appropriate PPE is limited, then the non-time sensitive surgery or procedure should be cancelled.""
But the letter doesn’t say hospitals would be cut off from resources if they didn’t obey the guidelines. 
What DHHS said
When we asked DHHS about Daniel’s tweet, spokeswoman Amy Ellis denied his claim.
""That is false. Secretary Cohen did not say that,"" Ellis said in an email and referred us back to the hospital Association.
When we relayed what Burns said, Ellis suggested someone got confused about the department’s plans.
""Secretary Cohen has never indicated that,"" she said. ""Conversations between staffers can easily be misunderstood.""
Since Daniel posted his tweet, several North Carolina hospitals announced plans to resume some elective procedures.
What hospitals said
PolitiFact reached out to several hospital systems to see if DHHS threatened to withhold PPE.
""I’m told that’s not true,"" said Alan Wolf, spokesman for the UNC Health System. He added that UNC Health leaders and providers are growing concerned about further delays in care for some patients. UNC Health has been doing less than half its usual volume of procedures and will probably increase it to 65% to 75%, Linda Butler, the system’s chief medical officer, recently told the News & Observer.
Duke Health didn’t receive any correspondence from DHHS indicating the department might withhold PPE, said Sarah Avery, director of Duke’s Health News Office.
""Duke Health hospitals received a letter May 1 from the secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Mandy Cohen, notifying us that the elective and non-urgent procedures and surgeries can be resumed in accordance with guidance developed by the North Carolina Healthcare Association (NCHA),"" Avery said. 
Novant and Wake Forest Baptist hospitals also plan to resume elective procedures, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. PolitiFact called and emailed those health systems, but neither responded to questions about Daniel’s claim.
Our ruling
Sen. Daniel tweeted: ""It’s being reported that NC DHHS is telling hospitals that if they decide to do elective surgeries, they won’t be eligible to receive PPE from the state."" Let’s break that down.
The only ""report"" Daniel cited -- and the only report PolitiFact could track down -- was a conversation between a DHHS staffer and a representative for the North Carolina Healthcare Association. DHHS denied that the staffer said what the association’s representative claimed, describing their conversation as a misunderstanding. 
Daniel said ""DHHS is telling hospitals"" about the conditions for receiving PPE. But hospitals who spoke to PolitiFact said they were never given the alleged ultimatum. 
Daniel’s tweet also tied the ultimatum to secretary Cohen. But, in her email to PolitiFact, the association’s representative didn’t tie the ""notion"" to Cohen, and we couldn’t find any other evidence that DHHS threatened to withhold PPE from hospitals that resumed elective surgeries.

There is no vaccine for COVID-19, the new coronavirus that first appeared in China. None is expected soon.


The vaccine for cattle won’t help humans, and won’t protect against this new form of coronavirus.





See the sources for this fact-check




The fact that there’s already a coronavirus vaccine for cattle should make you doubt claims that the virus causing the current human outbreak is new and deadly.
That’s what a Facebook post would lead you to believe. It adds to a long list of misleading claims about the virus that, as of March 1, 2020, had hit 59 countries.  
""Just in case you are wondering how much the media controls people, America has been vaccinating cattle for coronavirus for years,"" the Feb. 27, 2020, post claims, ""yet the news tells you it’s new and gunna kill you all so go buy mask.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post shows a photo of a bottle with labeling that includes, ""Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine"" and ""For veterinary use only."" (The image and the post were deleted in the course of our reporting, but we found similar posts showing the image elsewhere along with similar claims.)
The vaccine pictured, called ScourGuard 4K, is made by animal drug manufacturer Zoetis and is real. And we found products with similar labeling available for sale online.
But the vaccine is, according to the drug manufacturer, ""effective as an aid in preventing diarrhea caused by bovine rotavirus (serotypes G6 and G10), bovine coronavirus, and E. coli in calves of vaccinated dams."" It won’t help humans, at least not now.
Why it won’t help
""The coronavirus used in the Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine is distinct from the current coronavirus,"" said Ming Tan, a faculty member of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. 
""The antibodies produced by the Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine will not recognize the current"" coronavirus ""and thus will not protect humans from infection.""
Studies would need to be done to determine whether the bovine vaccine could provide any help with the current coronavirus, said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""The bovine vaccine may be formulated in a manner that is not conducive to humans,"" he said.
There is a ""very remote"" chance a bovine vaccine might work in humans, said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, but ""the possibility it would work is low enough that it is more efficient to design a vaccine specifically for COVD-19.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Sorting out terms
It helps to differentiate some terms being used in the news and social media.
Many reports refer to the coronavirus. But coronavirus is a general term; there are different coronaviruses out there. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. They’ve been around for a long time, but there are different strains.
More specific terms relating to the current situation include:
2019 novel coronavirus — novel, as in, new.
SARS-CoV-2 — the technical name of the new virus.
COVID-19  — the name of the disease caused by the new coronavirus, as in ""coronavirus disease, 2019.""
All three of those terms refer specifically to the coronavirus that was discovered in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread around the world.
Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 and none is expected soon.
One of the leading American experts on coronavirus, Anthony Fauci, who is director of the federal government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News on Feb. 27, 2020, his team is working with a drugmaker and expects to begin a clinical trial within the ""next month and a half.""
""That whole process is going to take about a year to a year and a half. Even though we are going as fast as you possibly can, it's still going to take a good year, year and a half to see if we have a vaccine that works,"" he said.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims: ""America has been vaccinating cattle for coronavirus for years, yet the news tells you it’s new and gunna kill you all so go buy mask.""
Despite what the post suggests, the existence of a bovine vaccine doesn’t mean there is a coronavirus vaccine for humans, and none is expected soon.

Donald Trump","Trump wrong that COVID-19 death projections omit revisions based on social distancing




If Your Time is short




A University of Washington model predicts 134,000 deaths by early August. That model takes into account mitigation.




See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump downplayed academic projections that COVID-19 deaths could rise higher than previously expected this summer.
Trump was asked about new projections multiple times on May 5, the day he traveled to Arizona to tour a mask factory. 
ABC’s David Muir asked Trump about a model by Johns Hopkins University that said the daily death rate could rise to 3,000 a day, as well as a University of Washington update that projected 135,000 deaths by early August.
Trump criticized the models as ""out of whack.""
""Those models that you're mentioning are talking about without mitigation,"" Trump replied. ""Well, we're mitigating, and we've learned to mitigate.""
Mitigation generally refers to steps to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing, requiring people to wear masks and reducing public gatherings. 
In recent days, many states or counties have loosened such restrictions or have announced plans to do so, reopening beaches, restaurants and shops. Medical experts have cautioned that such measures could lead to more cases. 
By saying the new reports don’t factor in mitigation, Trump made it sound like they didn’t reflect ongoing efforts to limit the spread. But Trump is wrong — the University of Washington update does take into account mitigation such as social distancing. The Johns Hopkins data was a draft and was not intended as a forecast.
RELATED: Donald Trump’s 4 biggest falsehoods on ABC News
University of Washington model includes mitigation
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington released an updated forecast showing about 134,000 deaths by early August. That was nearly double their forecast in late April.
The revision reflects the winding down of social distancing measures expected in the majority of states by May 11.
""Increases in testing and contact tracing, along with warming seasonal temperatures — factors that could help slow transmission — do not offset rising mobility, thereby fueling a significant increase in projected deaths,"" the university said.

The ""model includes mitigation and always has,"" Amelia Apfel, a spokeswoman for the institute, told PolitiFact in an email.
The institute’s published frequently asked questions contains more details about how it factors social distancing into the models. 
Some experts have criticized the model as the numbers have fluctuated. 
Johns Hopkins model was in the works
The model from Johns Hopkins University caused a stir after the New York Times reported on an internal federal document showing deaths of 3,000 a day by June, compared with 1,750 now.
The draft slide show, published by the Washington Post, included preliminary information from a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor who is contracted with the Federal Emergency Management Administration. Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology, told the Washington Post that his work contained a range of possibilities. A Johns Hopkins spokeswoman told PolitiFact that it is not a forecast.
""The information illustrates that there are some scenarios, including the premature relaxation of social distancing, that are likely to cause significant increases in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States,"" the university said.
We emailed Lessler directly to ask if his 3,000 figure took into account mitigation and did not get a reply. In Lessler’s interview with NPR, he said the various scenarios took into account how effective current measures are, and that his contract with FEMA prevents him from sharing his final projections with the public.
The White House told media outlets that the numbers had not been vetted or presented to the coronavirus task force.
The Trump administration has made it clear that even with mitigation the U.S. death toll will grow. 
""Our projections have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost, and that's with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance,"" said Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, on Fox News Sunday.
Our ruling
When Trump was asked about new models projecting COVID-19 deaths, Trump responded that they ""are talking about without mitigation.""
The Johns Hopkins data was preliminary, and not designed as a forecast. The researcher told NPR that he assumed some degree of mitigation. Trump is clearly wrong about the University of Washington’s model, which does take into account mitigation efforts.

In separate interviews with reporters on March 18, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said China has been the source of multiple recent contagions breaking out because of what he called a culture of eating some animals such as bats, snakes and dogs.
In remarks captured by The Hill, Cornyn said this applies to the new coronavirus.
""China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the swine flu and now the coronavirus,"" he said. ""I think they have a fundamental problem and I don't object to geographically identifying where it is coming from.""
He made a similar comment on a weekly conference call with reporters in Texas, stating that the ""open meat markets that serve everything from bats to tapirs to snake to dog meat"" allow viruses to jump from animals to humans.
The Hill’s video clip of Cornyn’s remark was shared thousands of times on social media, so we’ll focus on fact-checking that statement, keeping the context of his second claim in mind.
Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie said Cornyn’s statement is referring to the culture behind so-called wet markets in China.
""If people didn’t eat that type of meat, wet markets would not exist,"" he said in an interview, referencing the animals Cornyn identified in his remarks.
Let’s dive in.
SARS, MERS and Swine Flu
Before we address the parts of Cornyn’s claim related to the coronavirus, let’s take a look at his assertion that the viruses SARS, MERS and swine flu originated in China.
Cornyn is right about SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which was first reported in 2003 in the Guangdong province of southern China, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
SARS is thought to be an animal virus, but its source remains uncertain. It is believed to have spread from the source animal to other animals and infected humans, according to the World Health Organization.
But Cornyn is wrong about where the first MERS and swine flu cases were reported. Brandewie said Cornyn misspoke when included them in his list.
MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the CDC.
Swine flu, or the H1N1 flu, was first identified in humans in the United States in 2009, according to the CDC.
Transmission of the virus
The first part of Cornyn’s claim states that people in China ""eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.""
But Peter Li, associate professor of East Asian Politics at the University of Houston, said this type of cuisine is not representative of Chinese culture.
""Chinese as a whole do not have wildlife eating habit,"" Li said in an email. ""It is the eating habit of a small number of people, just like a small number of people in the U.S. dare to eat rattlesnakes or the like. … The eating habit is not Chinese and not traditional.""
Even considering the small population that may consume these animals, Adam Kamradt-Scott, an associate professor of global health security at the University of Sydney in Australia, said ""The consumption of exotic meats is not, in itself, the problem.""
""The issue is instead the level and extent of the human-animal interface that wet markets permit,"" he said in an email. ""Having said this, we have yet to identify the host animal for the COVID-19 virus. … It has also not been verified whether the COVID-19 virus infected humans at the wet market in Wuhan, only that some of the first cases to be identified had a history of having visited the wet market.""
The CDC’s situation page for the new virus states that early cases in China ""had some link"" to the market, as did numerous news articles highlighted by Brandewie in response to PolitiFact’s inquiry.
But researchers have yet to pinpoint when, where or how the virus was transmitted from animals to humans.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







""It was originally suggested that it began at the Wuhan fish market, but there is no longer good evidence to support that,"" said Vincent Racaniello, a virology professor in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at Columbia University who is researching the virus. ""The first case was not associated with that market and now we think there were earlier clusters in November not associated with the market.""
Racaniello pointed to a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of January by researchers in China looking at the first 425 confirmed cases of the virus.
The data shows that while the first reported cases of the new virus were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, the first identified case of the virus predated the publicly reported cases and was found in a person with no connection to the market.
Other researchers also identified early cases unrelated to the market.
In the March 15 episode of his virology podcast, This Week in Virology, Racaniello interviewed coronavirus researcher Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill about the origins of the current pandemic.
Baric said researchers have identified numerous SARS-like strains in bats and said it is ""just a question of time for when a human comes in contact with a bat"" carrying these viruses and that sparks a new pandemic.
He added that it is entirely possible that the current outbreak was caused by a person in rural China who came into contact with a bat or bat guano and then traveled to Wuhan and started the outbreak. 
Baric said the initial contact could have occurred in a farmer harvesting bat guano to use as fertilizer or ""just by random chance"" in a person who came into contact with bat guano when a bat flew overhead and its droppings fell.
Not strictly cultural
It’s true that markets that sell live animals that are slaughtered on the premises pose a risk or viruses to be transmitted from animals to humans, but experts said this risk exists across the globe and is not unique to China.
""His claim, if it were true, is ridiculous,"" said Li, the University of Houston professor. ""No country in the world monopolizes the outbreaks of epidemics.""
Racaniello said that suggesting the new coronavirus is ""spread simply by eating a bat is too simplistic,"" as is pointing only to China as the source of new viruses.
""If you eliminated all eating of bats, you would still have these spillovers,"" he said. ""The four mild coronaviruses we have probably crossed from bats into humans hundreds of years ago — that could have happened anywhere. This is much broader than eating a bat in a meat market. I think that’s the important key here, that there are a lot of ways for viruses to get from various animals into humans.""
Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist and president of the research organization EcoHealth Alliance, said global health experts discussed the potential of a new pandemic in 2018 (labeling it ""Disease X""), as pandemics are on the rise and the world’s strategy for dealing with these illnesses is ""woefully inadequate,"" in  op-ed for the New York Times.
Daszak wrote:
""These spillovers are increasing exponentially as our ecological footprint brings us closer to wildlife in remote areas and the wildlife trade brings these animals into urban centers. Unprecedented road-building, deforestation, land clearing and agricultural development, as well as globalized travel and trade, make us supremely susceptible to pathogens like coronaviruses.""
Science writer David Quammen discussed future risk during an interview on NPR’s Fresh Air in February, and said the reason the globe is seeing more viruses in humans is because we ""are so abundant and so disruptive on this planet that we come in contact with these things.""
He continued:
""There's 7.7 billion of us. We're cutting the tropical forests. We're building work camps in those forests and villages. We're eating the wildlife. We're transporting wildlife around the world. We're raising a lot of domestic livestock that become exposed to viruses through wildlife.
""We're doing all these forms of disruption that I say sometimes that you go into a forest and you shake the trees, literally and figuratively, and viruses fall out. And if they fall out of their hosts, they need a new host. And we're there. We're available. We're their opportunity. And then we fly around the world and carry it every which way.""
Our Ruling
Cornyn said: ""China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine Flu and now the coronavirus.""
First of all, Cornyn is wrong that MERS and the Swine Flu were first identified in humans in China. He is right that SARS and the new coronavirus were first identified in humans there. 
The problem with Cornyn’s claim is his assertion that Chinese culture is at fault. Experts said the threat of viral transmission from animal to human is not unique to China, and the risk of this kind of spillover is growing globally as humans come into closer contact with animals.
Plus, experts noted that any consumption of the animals Cornyn mentioned is not, in itself, the problem.
It is also worth noting that researchers have not pinpointed exactly when, where or how the coronavirus hopped from animals to humans. While early reports indicated that the virus jumped from animals to humans at a seafood market in Wuhan, further study has identified cases predating those in people with no connection to the market.

If Your Time is short





An upcoming book by Dr. Anthony Fauci about the coronavirus pandemic titled “Expect the Unexpected: Ten Lessons on Truth, Service, and the Way Forward,” was developed by National Geographic Books and is slated to publish in the fall.


Fauci isn’t making any money off the book. The book draws from Fauci’s interviews and speeches throughout the pandemic, and is being produced in connection with an upcoming National Geographic documentary film about him.


The earnings will go to the nonprofit National Geographic Society.

Dr. Anthony Fauci has an upcoming book about the lessons he’s learned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The book, ""Expect the Unexpected: Ten Lessons on Truth, Service, and the Way Forward,"" was developed by National Geographic Books and is scheduled to be released on Nov. 2, 2021.
Some online have criticized Fauci over the book, claiming that he’s cashing in on it while Americans continue to suffer. 
""Tony Fauci will make millions off of a new book about ‘Truth’ while Americans continue to suffer because of his endless stream of lies over the past year,"" reads a June 1 tweet by Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. ""The highest paid employee of the federal government is set to profit even more off this pandemic. What a disgrace.""
Kirk got one thing right — as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, Fauci is the highest paid employee of the federal government. 
But he isn’t going to profit from the book.

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







National Geographic Books developed the 80-page book in connection with an upcoming National Geographic documentary film about Fauci.
National Geographic spokesperson Chris Albert told PolitiFact that, although Fauci is listed as the author, he didn’t write anything specifically for the book. Instead, National Geographic drew from interviews and speeches delivered by Fauci for the book.
""He was not paid and will not earn any royalties from its publication or from the upcoming documentary,"" Albert said. The earnings will go to the National Geographic Society, as well as being re-invested in content. The nonprofit conservation and education group has a joint venture with Walt Disney Co. that manages the National Geographic portfolio of media operations, including TV channels, magazines and book publishing.
The claim comes after the release of thousands of emails to and from Fauci during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. The emails, which were obtained legally through Freedom of Information Requests, have fueled several misleading posts online.
On June 1, the book was posted for pre-sale online on Amazon and Barnes & Noble before it was quickly taken down. The move prompted some to claim it was fallout over Fauci’s emails, but Albert said it was because the pre-sale was prematurely posted. The date it will return is still being determined, he said.

TikTok posts","No, Red Cross isn't warning vaccinated people not to donate blood




If Your Time is short





A person can donate blood or plasma following their COVID-19 vaccine. The only stipulations from the American Red Cross are that the individual must know which vaccine they received, be healthy and not have symptoms of COVID-19.


The Red Cross noted the Johnson & Johnson shot in particular as being safe, and said there has been no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots as a result of donating blood after receiving a J&J vaccine or for patients who received blood donated by these people.





See the sources for this fact-check




A TikToker detailed his experience of donating plasma at a location of the American Red Cross, where he said he was warned by a woman who worked there not to get the vaccine. 
""She told me, ‘because you won’t be able to donate plasma if you’ve had the shot,’"" the man in the video said. ""I asked her if it’s just out of precaution because you don’t know what’s in it? She said, ‘no, we know what’s in it. That’s why you can’t donate blood, because it’s completely tainted.’""
The man went on to say that if the Red Cross is warning people that the COVID-19 vaccine is tainted, it’s probably best to listen, since they’ve been around for a long time.
But that isn’t what the Red Cross really says.
Despite what the Tik Tok user might have heard, the Red Cross issued a news release on Feb. 24, 2021, that said people can indeed donate blood, platelets and AB Elite plasma after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.)
The Red Cross offered some additional details: People can donate blood as long as they know which company manufactured the vaccine: Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson. The organization also lists recipients of two vaccines that are in trials in the U.S., Novavax and AstraZeneca, as eligible for blood donation.
As long as a person has the manufacturer’s name and they feel healthy, without symptoms of COVID-19, |it’s safe to donate right afterward. 
""Knowing the name of the vaccine manufacturer is important in determining donor eligibility,"" said American Red Cross spokesperson Jessica Merrill. ""If a donor does not know the name of the manufacturer of the vaccine they received, they will be asked to wait for two weeks before giving blood.""

The donation process for a vaccinated person is the same as usual, Merrill said. It takes about one hour, and includes registration upon arrival, a confidential questionnaire about their health history and places traveled, and checks of temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse. 
Merrill said one reason for misinformation about blood donation following the COVID-19 vaccine is that many regular blood donors are aware that some immunizations do require a wait period. However, Merrill said that’s not the case with the COVID-19 vaccines.
""Similar to other vaccines such as measles, mumps or influenza, the COVID-19 vaccine — including the J&J vaccine — is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream,"" Merrill said.
Distribution of the J&J vaccine resumed in the U.S. after health authorities paused its use to investigate limited cases of blood clots. 
""There is no evidence of or reason to suspect an increased risk of blood clots as a result of donating blood after receiving a J&J vaccine or for patients who receive donations from these individuals,"" Merrill said.
Our ruling
In a TikTok video, a man said he was told by a staff member at the American Red Cross that a person vaccinated against COVID-19 can’t donate plasma, because their blood has been completely tainted. 
The Red Cross refuted this statement, saying that a vaccinated person can indeed donate blood if they know who manufactured their vaccine and they are healthy. If the person doesn’t know who manufactured the vaccine, they must wait two weeks before donating.
All COVID-19 vaccines, including the J&J shot, are safe for blood donations.

If Your Time is short





A U.S. Customs and Border Protection database allows personnel to run background checks on people apprehended at the border and access records collected by U.S. and foreign authorities. 


CBP might not have full access to a person’s medical records, but the agency says it screens people for COVID-19 and other health issues.





See the sources for this fact-check




Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., arguing against President Joe Biden’s immigration agenda, claimed that there’s no screening process for people coming into the United States.
While millions of Americans are out of work, Cotton said in a Feb. 1 Fox News interview, Biden wants to give ""amnesty to 15 million"" people living illegally in the country, invite more guest workers, and give people ""with bogus claims of asylum"" an opportunity to come into the country to work.
""And we are in a pandemic, good job,"" Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade responded sarcastically.
Cotton continued: ""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security."" He praised former President Donald Trump’s ""Remain in Mexico"" policy to keep asylum seekers in Mexico, ""as opposed to being released into our country"" pending a hearing.
During his presidential campaign, Biden promised a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people illegally in the country, and spoke out against the Remain in Mexico program, saying he would allow people seeking asylum to stay in the U.S. while their cases were under review. Biden’s administration stopped enrolling people in the program, but has not revoked it.
We asked Cotton’s press office for more information about his claim that there’s ""no way to screen"" migrants.
""Relying on the honor system for security and health background checks is not a sufficient screen,"" said Caroline Tabler, a spokesperson for Cotton.
But U.S. officials don’t have to rely on an ""honor system."" U.S. Customs and Border Protection has tools and processes to screen immigrants who are apprehended at the border for health and security issues, even if the people aren’t fully upfront or don’t have medical records or documentation on hand proving they have a clean background.
Health screenings by border officials
CBP told PolitiFact that it does initial inspections for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19, and ""pursuant to longstanding infectious disease protocols,"" refers immigrants who might have an infectious disease to local clinics or hospitals ""for appropriate medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.""
Procedures for COVID-19 have been in place since the beginning of the pandemic, said Matthew Dyman, a spokesperson for the CBP.
In late April, CBP said that a 31-year-old Indian man was the first person in its custody to test positive for COVID-19.
The oversight office within the Department of Homeland Security surveyed CBP personnel from April 22 to May 1. Ninety percent of the Border Patrol stations and ports of entry offices that responded to the survey said they conducted risk assessments to determine if people in CBP custody were exposed to COVID-19.
Protocols included ""screening individuals for COVID-19 symptoms when they are initially processed at a facility, and continued monitoring for potential COVID-19 symptoms for as long as they remain in CBP custody,"" said the September 2020 inspector general report. The report said, however, that it was rare for facilities to be able to administer COVID-19 tests on site.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







As of July 13, 58 migrants across all Border Patrol stations had tested positive for COVID-19, the report said.
CBP in late 2019 issued a directive to improve the medical screening of people in its custody  after several children died while in CBP care. The three-phase approach called forCBP personnel to observe people for potential medical issues, conduct health interviews on all people under 18 years old, ""at a minimim""; and ""subject to availability of resources and operational requirements,"" perform a medical assessment on children age 12 and younger and people with a known or reported medical concern. Implementation of the directive was contingent upon funding and resources, the CBP acting commissioner said in 2019.
Whether CBP’s health screening procedures are sufficient and effective can be debated, but it’s inaccurate to say there’s ""no way to screen"" people.
The Texas Tribune and ProPublica reported in August that a different immigration agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was testing unaccompanied children for COVID-19 and deporting those who tested negative. The news organizations said that ICE had agreements with 10 countries requiring that children test negative for COVID-19 before being sent back to their home countries. The Washington Post reported in early December that 1,061 minors in U.S. immigration custody had tested positive for COVID-19 since March.
In March 2020, the Trump administration invoked Title 42, a section of federal law that allows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to deny entry to immigrants coming from countries with infectious disease outbreaks. So far, Biden’s administration has kept that directive, allowing quick expulsion of people arriving at the border.
Security screenings by border officials
CBP has access to international databases through TECS, an information-sharing platform that allows the agency to obtain the criminal history of a person who attempts to enter the United States, said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School.
A 2016 DHS report said that the purpose of TECS was ""to track individuals who have violated or are suspected of violating a law or regulation that is enforced or administered by CBP, to provide a record of any inspections conducted at the border by CBP, to determine admissibility into the United States, and to record information regarding individuals, firms, and organizations to whom DHS/CBP has issued detentions and warnings.""
CBP statistics on the number of ""criminal aliens"" identified at the border prove that CBP regularly identifies individuals with criminal histories before they enter the United States, Hallett said.
If a person poses a threat to national security, they can’t get asylum, said Lynn Marcus, director of the Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic at the University of Arizona. ""There is a process for screening all of this,"" she said.
Our ruling
Cotton said, ""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or security.""
A CBP database allows personnel to run criminal background checks on people apprehended at the border and access records collected by U.S. and foreign authorities. CBP routinely publishes data on immigrants who attempted to enter the country and have a criminal record. 
CBP might not always have access to a person’s full medical records, but the agency says it screens people for COVID-19 and other health issues. 
It’s fair to question whether existing protocols are sufficient, but it’s inaccurate to say ""we have no way to screen"" immigrants.

Facebook posts","No, New York didn’t lift COVID-19 restrictions because of a Cuomo wedding




If Your Time is short



• On June 15, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that state-mandated COVID restrictions would be lifted because 70% of adult New Yorkers have received a COVID-19 vaccine.
• Cuomo’s daughters aren’t “getting married any time soon,” according to a spokesperson.
• Claims about a Cuomo wedding seem to have started because of a Buffalo News article from 1993.



See the sources for this fact-check




On Tuesday, June 15, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that state-mandated COVID-19 restrictions would be lifted immediately because New York had reached an important milestone: 70% of adults have received at least the first dose of a vaccine.
But it didn’t take long for some social media users to start speculating that the governor had a more personal rationale for lifting the restrictions. 
""Cuomo opens New York 72 hours before his daughter's wedding SUCKERS,"" reads one Facebook post shared hours after Cuomo’s announcement.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Is there any truth to the claim? No. Cuomo’s daughters aren’t getting married this weekend, and restrictions were lifted only because New York met its vaccination goal.
None of Cuomo’s three daughters are getting married any time soon ""as far as we know,"" said Rich Azzopardi, director of communications and senior advisor to Cuomo.
He explained that 70% of adults being vaccinated was a ""benchmark for opening,"" and said the administration was ""excited to reach that mark on Tuesday.""
When making the announcement, Cuomo cited the Biden administration’s goal of giving 70% of adults nationwide at least the first dose of a vaccine by July 4.

""It is the national goal and we hit it ahead of schedule,"" Cuomo said. ""What does 70% mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it. [...] The state mandates that have proven right and correct and brought us through the pandemic are relaxed as of today, effective immediately.""
Claims about a Cuomo wedding have been circulating on social media for weeks. Azzopardi, and journalists working to debunk the claims pointed out that they were based on a decades-old article.
""The source of all this is a Buffalo News clip,"" Azzopardi said, noting that the story was from 1993.
The article, dated May 15, 1993, is titled, ""Cuomo daughter to wed judge’s son on June 12."" The story refers to Madeline Cuomo — Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s sister. At the time, Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo’s father, was the governor of New York.
In other words, Azzopardi said, the article that prompted the social media posts was about ""the wrong Governor Cuomo.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presumptively confirmed two cases of the 2019 coronavirus in Florida.


No Florida hospital has reported multiple confirmed patients.





See the sources for this fact-check




A popular article is inflating the number of 2019 coronavirus patients in Florida.
The story was published March 1 by a website called YourContent. Using an anonymous source, it claims there are multiple patients with the coronavirus at Doctors Hospital in Sarasota, Fla.
""A total at least (sic) three but possibly as many as 8 individuals have been exposed,"" the article reads. ""However, that figure does not include individuals that might’ve contracted the virus prior to the patient’s initial arrival, the source says.""
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared several hundred times.

Neither the state, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the hospital in question have confirmed the report.
The story comes from a website run by Nikolaos Hatziefstathiou, a Pennsylvania man who has been accused of fabricating documents, impersonating journalists and writing false news stories. In August, he was charged with tampering with public records, forgery and identity theft. Public domain records show that YourContent runs digital ads.
In a March 1 press release, the Florida Department of Health announced that there were two presumptively confirmed cases of the virus in Florida. One patient is a resident of Manatee County, which is directly north of Sarasota, and is being treated at Doctors Hospital.

Two health care workers in Alaska developed allergic reactions soon after receiving the vaccine, and were treated at the hospital where they worked, the New York Times reported. But we could find no evidence that the Pfizer vaccine has been linked to deaths anywhere since it was first distributed to health care workers. 
On Dec. 16, the Alabama Department of Public Health published a statement on Facebook debunking a rumor that claimed a 42-year-old nurse in Alabama died ""8-10 hours after getting the vaccine."" The post’s source: anonymous family members.
The state health agency ""has reached out to all hospitals in the state which administered the COVID-19 vaccine and confirmed there have been no deaths of vaccine recipients,"" the statement says. ""The posts are untrue.""
The FDA has not found any reason to believe that the Pfizer vaccine could cause death.
In a briefing document published prior to the Pfizer vaccine’s emergency approval, the agency said it had assessed the vaccine and found ""no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance"" of an emergency-use authorization. The vaccine was not found to cause death in any of the 43,448 participants in clinical trials ranging from April to December.

We found no credible reports of people dying because they used masks to stop the spread of the coronavirus.


Public health experts say it is not true that masks reduce blood oxygen levels. 


The CDC says that people with underlying medical conditions should still wear masks.

For more than seven minutes, a video on Facebook shows a man in a large brown chair reading calmly from his notes, predicting global food shortages as ""a side effect of the coronavirus hoax,"" and misleading about the use of masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
About 34 seconds in, the man says: ""The masks will kill quite a few people, it’s well known that they reduce blood oxygen levels and those with respiratory and cardiac disorders will die. It’s true that surgeons wear masks, but they are different masks and different circumstances and not usually worn all day.""
As he reads in a matter-of-fact tone, big red capital letters frame the video: ""They want to kill 6 billion of us. Here’s how they will do it.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The man in the Facebook video was described by The Bangkok Post, a Thailand-based news outlet as a doctor, prolific author, and former newspaper columnist ""who has built a career on being anti-establishment,"" and is now ""peddling played-out COVID-19 conspiracy theories.""
This video includes several unfounded and wrong claims, but this fact-check will focus on the claim about masks having a deadly effect.
Bottom line: Public health experts say masks are effective in reducing the spread of the coronavirus, and while some people may experience some discomfort wearing them, masks are generally safe to use. (The American Lung Association has suggestions on how to get used to wearing a mask.)
What’s known about mask usage
For months, people around the world have been using masks to prevent getting or spreading the coronavirus. We found no credible reports of people dying as a result of wearing a mask. Reuters in October debunked a false claim that three children in Germany died from wearing face masks. PolitiFact has also fact-checked a lot of misinformation about masks.
No, masks do not shut down or weaken the immune system. No, masks will not reduce blood oxygen levels.
""As a pulmonologist — a doctor who specializes in the respiratory system — I can assure you that behind that mask, your breathing is fine. You’re getting all the oxygen you need, and your carbon dioxide levels aren’t rising,"" Jonathan Parsons, a pulmonologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and director of the Ohio State Asthma Center, wrote in an August blog post.
Parsons wrote that people who experience anxiety or claustrophobia when wearing a mask can try to calm themselves by taking long, slow breaths.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard’s School of Public Health, told PolitiFact in May that, ""on the margins we could probably find extreme cases where someone, somewhere with some condition has had an issue with a mask, but that's not the average.""
Tsai said there was no data suggesting that it was harmful to wear a standard surgical or cloth mask under normal situations.
N95 masks (ones that create a tight seal) are considered to be the most effective in protecting the wearer from airborne particles, and are commonly used by health care workers. Because of a shortage of those masks, public health officials recommended that the general public instead use other types of masks, like cloth masks, and reserve the N95s for health care workers who are routinely exposed to patients with COVID-19.
What about people with underlying medical conditions?
The American Lung Association says that people with chronic lung diseases may be asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 and should wear cloth face masks in public areas.
There is some evidence that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body, the association said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters earlier this year that the level of carbon dioxide likely to build up in a mask ""is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it"" and that it is ""unlikely to cause hypercapnia,"" a condition that develops when there is too much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.
The CDC also says that most people with underlying medical conditions can and should wear masks. People with respiratory conditions who remain concerned about wearing a mask safely should talk with their healthcare provider, the CDC said.
The CDC does not recommend masks for children under 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

In a call with past members of his administration, former President Barack Obama criticized the Trump administration for bungling the response to the coronavirus.
""It would have been bad even with the best of governments,"" Obama said May 8. ""It has been an absolute chaotic disaster.""
Obama’s words drew anger from President Donald Trump’s supporters, one of whom tweeted on May 10: ""Barack Hussain Obama is the first Ex-President to ever speak against his successor, which was long (a) tradition of decorum and decency.""
Trump retweeted the claim, adding the comment: ""He got caught, OBAMAGATE!""

By tradition, former presidents extend some graciousness to their successors. But there is no hard and fast rule. And as you’ll see, former presidents have, when it suited them, criticized the person who followed them into the White House.

Hoover’s warnings against the New Deal
The first example that leaped to mind of three presidential historians we contacted is President Herbert Hoover, who lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932.
""He railed against the New Deal, FDR, liberalism and, in some ways, modernity itself, from the time he left office in 1933 until his death in the mid-1960s,"" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.
At the 1936 Republican convention, Hoover cast Roosevelt and the New Deal as a step toward dictatorship. 
""The New Deal may be a revolutionary design to replace the American system with despotism,"" Hoover said. ""Their product is the poisoning of Americanism.""
A generation later, Harry Truman seized the moment at the Democrats’ convention in 1956 to attack his Republican successor, Dwight Eisenhower, Claremont McKenna College’s John Pitney noted.

""For three and half years, the Eisenhower administration has been using every trick and device to pry our water power, and our forest, our parks and oil reserves out of the hands of people and into the pockets of a few selfish corporations,"" Truman said Aug. 17, 1956.
Ford, Carter and Reagan
Jump forward to 1977, when Republican Gerald Ford ridiculed the economic policies of the man who ousted him from office, Jimmy Carter.
""Mr. Carter's anti-inflation program came in like a lion,"" Ford said three months into Carter’s presidency. ""It's going out like a mouse.""
Carter carried on the tradition. In November 1982, he said President Ronald Reagan had undermined confidence in America’s global leadership.
""There's not that assured feeling now that our country is in the forefront of peace, nuclear arms control, human rights and environmental concern that it was before,"" Carter said in a news conference.
At the same event, Carter chastised Reagan for faulting Carter for the problems Reagan faced.
""There is always the temptation for an incumbent politician to blame all his mistakes on his predecessor,"" Carter said. ""Most are willing to withstand the temptation. Mr. Reagan, apparently, is not.""
The idea that Obama is the first president to criticize his successor has been around since at least 2018, when Snopes found it false, citing Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton as recent examples.
""Trump’s claim is simply not true under any possible definition of ‘speak against’ or ‘successor,’"" said Rutgers University historian David Greenberg.
Our ruling
A Twitter post, retweeted by Trump, claimed that Obama ""is the first ex-president to ever speak against his successor."" 
There are several examples of former presidents criticizing the person who followed them into office. For much of the past century, Republicans have spoken ill of Democrats, and Democrats have done the same with Republicans.
While the tradition of exercising restraint exists, it has its limits, and in at least one case, an ex-president spoke out as early as three months into the new administration.

Donald Trump","Fact-checking Trump’s claim that Pennsylvania ‘never opened’ after coronavirus closures




If Your Time is short




Day-to-day life in Pennsylvania hasn’t returned to normal, and it may not until a coronavirus vaccine is widely available. But the state’s schools and businesses aren’t uniformly shuttered as they were in the spring. 

 
All 67 Pennsylvania counties are in the “green” phase of Gov. Tom Wolf's three-phase reopening plan and have been since July 3, meaning most businesses may operate at 75% capacity, and school districts may decide whether to offer in-person instruction.

 
Pennsylvania ordered non-life sustaining businesses to close on March 19. Wolf issued a statewide stay-at-home order on April 1. Twenty-four counties moved from the “red” phase to the “yellow” phase on May 8. 

 



See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump has criticized some governors for imposing restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus, and at a rally in Erie on Tuesday, he lambasted Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf. 
Trump told his supporters that Pennsylvania ""never reopened"" after Wolf ordered the shutdown of ""non-life-sustaining businesses"" in March, soon after the outset of the pandemic.
""What the hell is going on with your state?"" Trump said. ""You guys never opened."" 
Day-to-day life in Pennsylvania hasn’t returned to normal, and it may not until a coronavirus vaccine is widely available. But the state’s schools and businesses aren’t uniformly shuttered as they were in the spring. 
All 67 Pennsylvania counties are in the ""green"" phase of the Wolf administration's three-phase reopening plan and have been since July 3, meaning most businesses may operate at 75% capacity, and school districts may decide whether to offer in-person instruction. Lebanon County, east of Harrisburg, was the last county to move from ""yellow"" to ""green."" 
Pennsylvania’s lockdown began on March 19, when Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close to help stop the spread of the virus. Two weeks later, Wolf issued a statewide stay-at-home order, and one week after that, he announced that schools would remain closed through the end of the academic year. 
At that point, all counties were in the ""red"" phase, with severe restrictions imposed by Wolf.  
In mid-April, the governor announced the criteria for counties to reopen — fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per 100,000 residents reported to the state in the previous 14 days. He said the state would also assess whether a county had enough testing and contact tracing, and he set May 8 as a target date to begin lifting restrictions.

By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







He followed through. 
That day, 24 counties moved from ""red"" to the ""yellow"" phase of reopening, and over the next two months, all counties moved into ""yellow"" and eventually to ""green,"" the least restrictive phase. 
Now that all Pennsylvania counties are in ""green,"" it has been up to each of the state’s 500 school districts to determine whether or not to offer in-person instruction. Philadelphia will welcome some students back to classrooms on Nov. 30, and Pittsburgh plans to reopen on Nov. 9. Students in the Central Bucks district returned on Sept. 30. 
All Pennsylvania counties have remained in the ""green"" phase even as case counts have climbed to the highest level since April, and Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine said as recently as Oct. 14 that the state has no plan to impose any new restrictions. 
""We're in a much better place than we were in the spring,"" Levine said.
Besides, whether Wolf has the power to impose another lockdown remains unsettled. In September, a federal judge struck down key elements of the governor’s virus mitigation strategy, labeling the limits he imposed on businesses and gatherings unconstitutional. The state appealed the ruling, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed to restore the restrictions on gatherings until it rules on Wolf’s petition for relief.
The state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which displays real-time data on confirmed cases of the virus, shows that Philadelphia, Delaware, Berks and Centre counties all have more than 2,000 cases per 100,000 residents, well above the threshold the state deems safe. Two dozen other counties have more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 residents. 
But so far, Wolf has not imposed any new restrictions. 
Our ruling 
Trump said Pennsylvania ""never opened."" That’s not true. Most businesses were closed and residents were ordered to stay home in April, but restrictions have been lifted gradually since May, and no new lockdowns have been ordered even as case counts climb.

Facebook posts","No, a CDC-WHO study does not prove that masks do not prevent spread of COVID-19




If Your Time is short





The study was done on influenza, which spreads in ways similar to COVID-19, but it makes no mention of COVID-19.


The study was published by the CDC and supported by WHO, but it was done by the University of Hong Kong.


One of the study’s authors told us the claim is incorrect.





See the sources for this fact-check




As Americans argue over whether face coverings stop the spread of COVID-19, a video shared on Facebook makes a stark claim about masks and viruses generally.
A 2020 study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the video declares, ""proves face masks do not prevent the spread of a virus."" 
The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
One of the study’s authors, University of Hong Kong public health professor Ben Cowling, told PolitiFact that the claim amounts to an ""incorrect interpretation"" of the study, ""confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence.""
Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, said of the study cited in the video: ""The bottom line is that this paper doesn’t prove that face masks don’t prevent transmission, but that the available data didn’t show a statistically significant effect.
""The available data is incomplete and more studies need to be done to better understand whether masks are effective at reducing community transmission or not. That is why I continue to wear a mask in public places.""
What’s known about masks
As we’ve reported, facial coverings are not in themselves totally effective in fighting the coronavirus, and there is a need for more study. But health officials largely agree that wearing any kind of face mask, coupled with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, is more protective than going unmasked. 
The CDC generally recommends wearing masks in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. 
As the CDC puts it: ""Your cloth face covering may protect them. Their cloth face covering may protect you.""
The video
The 15-minute video was narrated and posted by Ben Swann, who describes himself as a ""journalist who speaks truth to power!"" Swann, who has 486,000 Facebook followers, runs TruthInMedia.com, which says it provides ""content focusing on issues that impact humanity.""
The video was also shared the same day on YouTube by RT, a news network formerly known as Russia Today that is funded by the Russian Federation.
In February 2018, YouTube began labeling state-funded posts and videos promoting conspiracy theories. The step was significant, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time, in part because YouTube has been a major conduit for RT, ""which U.S. intelligence officials called ‘the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet.’""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







CDC and WHO ties to the study 
The study cited in the video was conducted by researchers at the University of Hong Kong — not by the CDC and WHO, as the video claims — although there are affiliations.
First published in February, the study appears in the May edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases, a peer-reviewed journal published by the CDC. The study says it was ""conducted in preparation for the development of guidelines by the World Health Organization on the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza in nonmedical settings,"" and was supported by the WHO.
The CDC confirmed it did not participate in the study and would not comment on it, but a spokesman cited a separate CDC study published in July. It looked at clients exposed to two hair stylists who were symptomatic with confirmed COVID-19. Among 139 clients who wore face masks while the stylists also wore face masks, there were no symptomatic secondary cases reported. Among 67 clients who tested for COVID-19, all test results were negative. ""Adherence to the community’s and company’s face-covering policy likely mitigated spread of COVID-19,"" the study said.
WHO did not provide comment before we published.
The study cited in the video reviews flu research
The study cited in Swann’s video amounts to a review of research on personal protective equipment and influenza spread. It does not mention coronavirus or COVID-19. 
After reviewing 10 studies on randomized and controlled trials that were published from 1946 to 2018, the study determined there was ""no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks."" That was regarding masks worn by infected persons or by persons in the general community.
""We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility,"" the researchers wrote. ""However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched.""
Cowling, one of the study’s authors, told us that because COVID-19 spreads in similar ways as to influenza, the study findings should apply to COVID-19.
But University of San Francisco research scientist Jeremy Howard cautioned that influenza and COVID-19 are different diseases, ""and we do not know whether evidence from influenza trials are relevant to COVID-19."" 
The ""we did not find evidence"" phrase doesn't prove either that masks are effective or ineffective, Howard said. He added that it’s important to note that none of the 10 trials reviewed was done during a pandemic.
Rasmussen reiterated that ""this was a systematic review of other published studies and it tells us much of what we already know: there’s not a good evidence base for masks outside of a healthcare setting, but there are still many knowledge gaps, especially regarding mechanisms of transmission."" 
Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman said the study reflects the understanding of masks in the early phase of the pandemic, but scientific opinion has shifted because of several important papers published since then.
""The kicker is,"" he added, ""just weeks later, a group with the same senior author, plus some coronavirus specialists, produced a paper demonstrating that masks are indeed highly effective in stopping infected people from releasing airborne viruses.""
The post claims a CDC study proved that masks do not prevent COVID-19. But it wasn’t a CDC study, and it didn’t ""prove"" that masks were ineffective.

A Facebook post claims new federal legislation to support contact tracing “is about controlling/tracking population, not about coronavirus.”


The bill strictly targets the novel coronavirus. It would provide $100 billion to organizations that do COVID-19 contact tracing and testing, or that offer services to people who are isolating at home.





See the sources for this fact-check




Proposed legislation in the U.S. House would provide new funding for testing and contract tracing to help public-health officials track and control the spread of the coronavirus.
But a Facebook post claims that the $100 billion bill ""is about controlling/tracking population, not about coronavirus.""
The May 12 post, which had more than 100,000 views by the next day, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The $100 billion is strictly targeted to fight COVID-19. It would fund not only contact tracing, a process aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, but also COVID-19 testing and services for people isolating at home.
What is contact tracing?
Contact tracing has become a key strategy of the White House plan to reopen states that went into shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. The process tasks public health workers with learning as much as they can about whom a patient has been in contact with, so they can be notified about their potential exposure.
While it does raise some privacy concerns, contact tracing has been used to slow the spread of other diseases, such as SARS and HIV. It’s a common strategy in public health agencies across the country.
State and local public health officials are hiring thousands of new contact tracers, but some experts say the federal government needs to spend billions of dollars to bolster those efforts.
The post
The claim about the proposed legislation is made by former television news reporter Ben Swann, who describes himself as a ""journalist who speaks truth to power!"" He runs TruthInMedia.com, which says it provides ""content focusing on issues that impact humanity.""
The headline of Swann’s post is: ""H.R. 6666: $100 Billion Contact Tracing Bill is About Controlling/Tracking Population, Not About Coronavirus.""
The post says: 
""A House resolution from Illinois Democrat Rep. Bobby Rush that would put Big Government in charge of tracking citizens’ movements as they relate to COVID-19 mitigation efforts — even sending health bureaucrats to ‘individuals’ residences, as necessary,’ as the legislation states.""

That wording is nearly the same as the first paragraph of a Washington Times article that’s labeled opinion/analysis and was published the same day as the Facebook post.
The post also includes a 15-minute video in which Swann claims the bill would create ""a massive new surveillance structure in this country."" 
In the video, which we did not fact-check, Swann argues that contact tracing is useful only in the early stages of an outbreak and now ""is completely useless"" in the United States because ""a massive amount of the population have been exposed to the disease."" Based on that, Swann argues that the contact tracing supported by the bill would be done to ""monitor you in your own home, traced in your home, your associations monitored, your movements monitored.""
Bill broader than contact tracing
H.R. 6666 was introduced by Rush on May 1 and is called the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone Act, or TRACE Act.
It would provide $100 billion in grants in the current fiscal year to faith-based organization, clinics, medical centers and other organizations that:


Perform testing for COVID–19;


Do contact tracing; or 


Provide services for individuals who are isolating at home. 


The bill would ""authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes.""
Swann told PolitiFact that the ""other purposes"" wording ""leaves room for interpretation and expansion.""

""The claim was not that the jump was ‘due to’ or caused by the election, but merely that it was linked,"" Bielinski said in an email. ""Linked is meant to convey correlation.""

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







That, frankly, doesn’t make any sense.
The entirety of Larson’s post was about the election, and it described the April 22 increase as occurring ""two weeks after the election."" Larson followed that by quoting an oft-criticized ""incredibly safe"" statement Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, made while working the polls on Election Day in full protective gear.

The only reasonable takeaway for readers is that Larson is claiming the election had something to do with the increase.
Brown County meat plant outbreak driving state increase
A cursory glance at the data, or headlines around the state, show jumps around April 22 weren’t about the election in general, but one outlier county.
Brown County has seen a tremendous surge in new cases due to a COVID-19 outbreak at several meat-packing plants. From April 19 to April 24, the county jumped from 215 confirmed cases to 605.
County health officials have traced about half those cases to meatpacking employees and their families, primarily from JBS Packerland in Green Bay. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration are both investigating.
But let’s turn back to April 22, the date Larson cited.
Wisconsin posted a record 225 new cases that day, after averaging 152 per day the week leading up to that. (As usual, the change in new cases corresponded with a change in testing, which rose to 1,886 on April 22 compared to an average of 1,558 the preceding week).
But Brown County accounted for 88 of those cases. Officials haven’t said exactly how many of those 88 were meat-packing related, but they have said there is no evidence linking the recent spike and the April 7 election.
If we take Brown County out of the equation, the number of new cases in Wisconsin was 137, not far off the daily average of 121 over the preceding week.

Of course, there have been coronavirus cases linked to the election. And officials say it’s too soon to say for sure what impact the election had on the coronavirus trends in Wisconsin.
On April 21, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services said 19 people who voted or worked the polls April 7 had tested positive, but officials said there is ""no way to know with certainty"" if they contracted the illness at the polls or somewhere else.
And those were factored into the state tallies before the April 22 spike Larson zeroed in on.
Our ruling
Larson referred to an April 22 jump in new coronavirus cases as coming ""two weeks after the election,"" then mocked Vos’ quote about the election being ""incredibly safe."" The obvious takeaway is that the jump and election are related.
We haven’t seen any evidence that’s true.
The increase that day was due in large part to a spike in Brown County, where outbreaks at meat-packing plants led to a surge in new cases. Brown County officials say there has been no evidence of a link between their case surge and the election.
We can’t say for sure how the election impacted the April 22 statistics, but connecting the entirety of that day’s increase to the election is an exaggeration.

Chris Murphy","Sen. Chris Murphy overstates travel from China after Trump restrictions




If Your Time is short





The number of people that flew directly in from China after Trump’s travel restrictions went into effect was reported in April to be around 40,000, not 400,000. 


Those travelers were American citizens and other authorized travelers who were exempted from the restrictions.


That number is now higher, according to new U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data of both direct and indirect flights from China through mid May.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump often credits restrictions he imposed on travel from China with saving American lives. But Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the ""ban"" didn’t stop everyone.
""We have had just an absolute abysmal failure of leadership from the White House since the very beginning,"" Murphy told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace in a May 11 interview.
""Effectively, after the travel ban — a travel ban that just didn't work, 400,000 people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions — after that, the president just gave up.""
We won’t weigh in on whether the travel ban ""just didn’t work,"" as Murphy claimed. But Murphy is wrong on the number. He mixed up two numbers from an April 4 New York Times report. 
The New York Times analysis detailed the number of travelers that arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China toward the start of 2020. The analysis relied on flight and other data from the U.S. Commerce Department, American firms MyRadar and FlightAware, and VariFlight, an aviation data company based in China, according to the report.
RELATED: Are COVID-19 travel restrictions ‘more critical in saving lives’ than testing? Not really
Murphy was referring to a larger number that included travel both before and after Trump’s restrictions kicked in. According to the report, there were at least 430,000 people who flew directly into the U.S. from China between Dec. 31, 2019, when China notified the World Health Organization that it was treating cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown illness, and early April. 
That total included a smaller number of travelers whose direct flights occurred after Trump imposed travel restrictions on China starting Feb. 2 — and this smaller number is what Murphy should have used when talking about what happened after the restrictions.
Almost 40,000 ""Americans and other authorized travelers"" entered in the two months after the Trump administration announced the restrictions, the report said. The travel restrictions made exceptions for U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their family members. 
The New York Times report mentioned both numbers in its first paragraph:
""Since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonialike illness to international health officials on New Year’s Eve, at least 430,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after President Trump imposed restrictions on such travel, according to an analysis of data collected in both countries.""
Murphy spokesperson Jaime Geller said the senator ""misspoke and meant to say that 400,000+ people traveled to the U.S. from the start of the outbreak, referencing this New York Times reporting.""

The report said ""the bulk"" of the passengers arrived in January on more than 1,300 direct flights to the U.S. from China. It said 279 direct flights from China flew in between the time of the report and the start of Trump’s travel restrictions, which have since expanded in several ways.

The New York Times’ passenger counts didn’t include the number of travelers who came from China through connecting flights, stopping in another country en route to the U.S. But a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection gave us that information.
The spokesperson said the agency’s preliminary data for both direct and indirect flights counted 68,409 authorized travelers — most of whom were U.S. citizens — that entered the U.S. from China between the implementation of the travel restrictions and May 11. 
It’s unknown how many people who came into the U.S. from China had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, or whether many of the individuals who returned to the U.S. in the months after the travel restrictions took effect were infected. 
The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S. returned to the state of Washington from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak was first documented. Chinese government data shows that the earliest known case was Nov. 17, per the South China Morning Post.
Travel into the U.S. is currently prohibited for ""certain foreign nationals who have been physically present"" in China, Iran, Ireland, the United Kingdom or 26 other countries in Europe in the previous two weeks, the CBP spokesperson said.
American citizens, legal residents and other exempted individuals can continue to travel into the U.S., the spokesperson said, but they require screening upon arrival and can only come in through one of 13 U.S. airports.

Our ruling
Murphy said Trump implemented ""a travel ban that just didn't work, 400,000 people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions.""
That is wrong. The New York Times reported a much lower number for people who flew directly into the U.S. from China after Trump’s limits went into effect — around 40,000 over two months. Those travelers were American citizens and other travelers exempted from the restrictions.
The number is slightly higher when you factor in the number of travelers who took indirect flights and the number who have come in since the New York Times published its analysis in April. But it’s still far from 400,000.

Gordon Hintz","No, unemployment is not a 'fake' crisis in Wisconsin




If Your Time is short





Wisconsin’s outdated unemployment insurance system has remained largely unchanged despite an array of warning signs across the last three gubernatorial administrations.


Hintz was condemning Republicans for not acting in 2020 as tens of thousands of Wisconsin residents saw checks delayed — often by months — due to the overwhelmed system.


But Hintz moved beyond blame in claiming that Republicans are now pushing a “fake” crisis, which is flat wrong.





See the sources for this fact-check




The floundering unemployment system has been an ongoing thorn in Wisconsin’s side, as the outdated system has staggered beneath the weight of a pandemic-fueled surge in claims.
It has provided yet another excuse for partisan finger-pointing, with Republicans blaming Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for not taking action to address the crisis, and Democrats noting Republicans haven’t pursued substantive upgrades for the system through the eight years they controlled state government — or throughout 2020.
RELATED: No, Evers cannot unilaterally OK a new unemployment system
The sides came together — a rare occurrence in recent Wisconsin politics — on the first steps of an overhaul plan, which Evers signed into law Feb. 25, 2021. The project is expected to cost around $100 million and take years to complete.
But the runup to that agreement included an interesting moment on the Assembly floor, as Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, took the microphone and chastised his Republican colleagues for the lack of action to that point.
""You guys can try to spin this and try to play politics with something like unemployment insurance, but it’s cynical, and it’s contrary to what we’re here to do today,"" Hintz said Feb. 23, noting steps Republicans have taken in recent years to add requirements for collecting unemployment. ""We need to have some urgency, we need to depoliticize the pandemic, and we need to be honest.
""You need to be honest with yourselves about what the obstacles to UI have been and quit trying to create a fake unemployment insurance crisis because of your guilt over all the things that you did over eight years.""
The last line jumped out to us.
Is it reasonable to claim Republicans are ""trying to create a fake unemployment insurance crisis""?
The unemployment mess
An audit released in September 2020 found fewer than 1% of calls to the Department of Workforce Development call centers were answered between March and June. That came shortly after Evers had asked the head of the agency to resign over the lingering backlog.
RELATED: Evers right that unemployment benefits harder to access, but multiple factors involved in delays
In November, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel detailed the devastating struggles of people who had been waiting months for their unemployment checks. For instance, Robert Johnson, a Milwaukee resident, had to sell a snowmobile, guns and a computer to pay bills, and he said his thoughts at one point turned to suicide.

“Before the pandemic, just over 40,000 were on continuing UI claims. Now, there are well over 100,000 on state or federal UI benefits.”












By D.L. Davis • June 18, 2021







At that point in time, more than 74,000 Wisconsin residents were still caught in the backlog of unemployment claims, adding up to over 554,000 weekly claims in need of processing.
In December, the Journal Sentinel reported 27,000 people were still stuck in the monthslong backlog. The article included the story of Angela Torres of Berlin, who had to file for bankruptcy while waiting since June for her claim to be processed.
News outlets and legislators alike have been flooded with similar stories from people forced into impossible decisions by the system’s failure to do timely processing. The Journal Sentinel in January detailed stories of people still waiting for their checks after the department asserted in December the backlog had been eliminated.
In short, there’s nothing fake about this crisis.
Joanna Beilman-Dulin, a spokeswoman for Hintz, defended his phasing this way:
""To be clear: Rep. Hintz absolutely believes, and has consistently highlighted, that people not getting their unemployment benefits when they need them was and still is a crisis in Wisconsin,"" she said in an email. ""People not getting their benefits more quickly over the last nine months because legislative Republicans chose to try to make Gov. Evers look bad rather than taking legislative action to address the UI delays, on the other hand, is an artificially-created, or fake, crisis.""
DOCUMENT: View a full transcript of Hintz’s remarks here
That simply doesn’t ring true.
There’s plenty of blame to go around in a discussion of why this crisis existed and persisted, but that doesn’t make it any less of a crisis. And it stemmed from an insufficient system that leaders from both parties failed to address for more than a decade.
Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle started a project to upgrade the system, but it was abandoned in 2007 after spending $23 million because of delays and cost overruns. His successor, Republican Gov. Scott Walker didn’t revive the project in his eight years despite having full Republican control of the Legislature and audits that showed significant deficiencies.
Our ruling
Criticizing Republican inaction in the face of a staggering Wisconsin unemployment system, Hintz said they are ""trying to create a fake unemployment insurance crisis.""
There’s a point to be made about Republican inaction throughout 2020, as the Wisconsin Legislature was one of the least active in the nation in the face of the pandemic.
But Hintz’s claim went beyond that — to a description that flies in the face of what many Wisconsinites have experienced. This is a very real crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people around the state.

Greg Abbott","Examining the effectiveness of Texas' statewide shutdowns




Several days after Gov. Greg Abbott declared that he wouldn’t impose ""any more lockdowns"" amid rising coronavirus cases, he defended that decision in a Nov. 19 press conference in Lubbock, where he was promoting the state’s distribution of a new antibody therapy.
He gave two reasons for not imposing the sort of shutdown measures he had implemented statewide twice before. First, shutdowns can have severe consequences on the mental, emotional and financial health of people, he said.
""Lesser known, however, is the ineffectiveness of it,"" Abbott continued.
""One thing that we’ve learned over the course of COVID is, one of the most common ways that COVID is spread today is not by someone going to work, but by people gathering together in home settings or in casual settings — after bars close or something like that,"" he said. ""So shutdowns will not lead to the positive results that some people think.""
Abbott issued his last statewide order restricting business operations near the end of June, when Texas was reporting what were then record-breaking daily case numbers — over 5,000 new cases for several consecutive days. He ordered bars closed, scaled back restaurant occupancy to 50% and allowed local governments to place restrictions on outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people.
In mid-September, as daily cases had dropped to an average of about 3,500, Abbott allowed restaurants, stores and offices to expand to 75% capacity in trauma service areas where COVID-19 patients occupied 15% or fewer of available hospital beds. In mid-October, he gave county officials the authority to allow bars to reopen, again as long as COVID-19 patients occupied 15% or fewer of hospital beds in the area. But by then, daily case numbers were beginning to rise again, and have continued to increase. This past week saw multiple records posted, with 14,600 new coronavirus cases recorded on Wednesday.
With such a rapid escalation of transmission across the state, we wanted to know whether statewide shutdowns are ineffective as Abbott says. And have we learned over the course of the pandemic that the virus is not commonly spread in workplaces?
Shutdown efficacy
It’s difficult to broadly determine the effectiveness of shutdowns without identifying a metric by which to gauge them. Abbott’s office didn’t respond to several inquiries asking for clarification on what he meant by ""ineffectiveness.""
But experts say that if effectiveness is measured strictly by case numbers and transmissions, then shutdowns or lockdowns have been shown to be effective in Texas and across the globe.
""If you say we’re just going to look at reducing the number of transmissions and cases, do lockdowns work? Yes they do. We clearly saw that during the spring,"" said Dr. Diana Cervantes, an epidemiologist at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.
""If you're looking at economic factors, social factors, or other factors — like what (shutdowns) mean for the big picture — then that's a different case,"" Cervantes said. ""There are ongoing implications that take longer to see their effects. But in regards to transmission, we know that lockdowns can be effective.""
On March 19, as the state was ramping up its testing capacity, Abbott issued the state’s first sweeping executive order, effective April 2, that closed bars, gyms and restaurants for dine-in and ordered people to avoid gathering in groups larger than 10. That same day, 26 new cases were reported statewide.
""Working together, we must defeat COVID-19 with the only tool that we have available to us — we must strangle its expansion by reducing the ways that we are currently transmitting it. We are doing this now, today, so that we can get back to business as usual more quickly,"" Abbott said then.
That shutdown lasted until May 1, when the state was reporting between 800 and 1,000 daily new cases with a positivity rate hovering around 10%. About a month later, daily case numbers started to rise precipitously, cresting at nearly 11,000 on July 15.
A primary reason that shutdowns were implemented during the early period of the pandemic was to allow government officials and scientists time to better understand the nature of the virus and its spread.
""When it comes to lockdowns, originally the idea was, we’re trying to learn more about the virus and until we get to that point, we need to be as safe as possible,"" Cervantes said. ""Now the idea is, we do know how the virus is primarily transmitted and what those prevention and control measures are.""
Furthermore, enforcing a shutdown at this point during the pandemic — as people are more likely to experience shutdown fatigue — is quite different than enforcing one in the pandemic’s early period, said Angela Clendenin, a public health assistant professor at Texas A&M University.
The first lockdown certainly slowed the spread, Clendenin said, ""but think about where we were as a population psychologically. All of a sudden we had this new and novel virus where there's no vaccine. … People were scared. They didn’t know what it was. At that point, the fear of the unknown I think made people much more compliant with the idea of a lockdown.""
But that fear began waning as the virus was better understood, she said. The diminishment of that fear combined with fatigue with virus restrictions makes lockdown enforcement much more difficult.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







""The idea of a lockdown seems intuitively to be a good answer when you're experiencing spikes in cases like what we've been seeing,"" she said. ""In theory they work, but it's implementing them that presents a lot of challenges. … The enforcement of a lockdown sometimes is just not practical.""
Workplace gatherings
It’s not clear upon what basis Abbott claims that the virus is not commonly spread in the workplace. While the ability for many employees to work remotely has reduced the number of transmissions borne out of workplace gatherings, many workers don’t have that remote option.
One of the most extreme examples was recorded in the Panhandle, when the first wave of the virus struck meatpacking plants and their refugee and immigrant workforce. With people working shoulder to shoulder, the plants became an incubator for the virus’ spread.
According to an analysis by the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, 12 meatpacking plants in Texas have reported nearly 1,500 cases and nine deaths.
In May, President Donald Trump declared the meatpacking plants essential businesses, which allowed the plants to keep running despite shutdown orders.
To Cervantes, Abbott’s comment that ""one of the most common ways that COVID is spread today is not by someone going to work"" ignores people’s limited options when it comes to earning a living.
""There’s a lot of people who don’t have choices and are put in a setting where they have increased exposure and there’s very little that can be done about it,"" she said.
On April 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration released guidelines that advise meatpacking plants to stagger shifts, implement social distancing among workers, add hand-washing stations and install plastic barriers.
Those guidelines, where implemented correctly, have helped keep the virus under control since those initial outbreaks, although some plants have been accused of violating the protocols.
The construction industry also has experienced COVID-19 transmissions and hospitalizations. In April, Abbott declared all construction work permissible statewide, exempting the industry from stay-home orders enacted by cities or counties.
In Austin, the stay-home order enacted in late March resulted in an estimated 73% reduction in the rate of local transmissions, according to a study published by the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. However, researchers found that the construction industry’s exemption was associated with an increase of COVID-19 hospitalizations among those workers. From the beginning of the pandemic through mid-August, hospitalization rates of construction workers increased from 0.22 per 1,000 workers to 9.3 per 1,000 workers.
""As the United States navigates relaxing and enacting policies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, communities should recognize the disproportionate burden of illness already experienced by workers in low-paying, high-contact industries,"" the study says.
However, this multifold increased risk of hospitalizations is estimated to be offset by safety measures, such as cleaning equipment between uses, wearing personal protective equipment and limiting the number of workers on a work site. These precautions were modeled to result in a 50% decrease in transmissions.
If these kinds of at-risk industries abide by preventative safety measures, then they can be kept relatively safe, Clendenin said. Rather, it’s the casual at-home settings — where people let their guard down around trusted friends and family — that is most troublesome to public health experts, she said.
""It really is at home in these small gatherings where people are letting their vigilance slip a little bit,"" she said. ""You forget to socially distance and you forget people should be wearing masks or washing hands, and you're laughing and having a great time, and you're propelling those droplets further than 6 feet.""
""It’s a comfort level that drives (transmissions) at those gatherings, more so than at the workplace,"" Clendenin said.
Our ruling
Abbott defended his decision to not impose a statewide shutdown in a Nov. 19 press conference, describing shutdowns as ineffective and saying that ""one of the most common ways that COVID is spread today is not by someone going to work.""
It’s hard to know by what metric Abbott gauges the efficacy of a shutdown. Experts say that if measuring strictly transmission rates and case numbers, shutdowns have proven to be effective in managing spread. But it’s harder to quantify the efficacy of a shutdown when considering all the social and economic consequences.
In Texas, case numbers rose after each time that Abbott lifted shutdowns.
Abbott’s comments about workplace gatherings not being a common way for COVID-19 to spread also ignores workplaces where proper precautions can be difficult to achieve.

And as for Prince Charles, he announced on April 1 that he experienced mild symptoms and is ""on the other side"" of his illness.

Chris Kapenga","Claim that there was mask requirement Wisconsin in May not true




If Your Time is short





Chris Kapenga said during an Oct. 11, 2020 interview on WKOW’s “Capital City Sunday” show that the effectiveness of masks was disproven in May in Wisconsin when a mask order was struck down 


But Gov. Tony Evers did not issue a mask mandate until July 30, 2020.


It went into effect Aug. 1





See the sources for this fact-check




Masks have become the center of political debate in Wisconsin, with Republican lawmakers going after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ mask order in court. 
While some GOP lawmakers acknowledge mask-wearing can help in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus, they have generally opposed any mandate for them.
That includes state Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), who in an Oct. 11, 2020, appearance on WKOW’s Capital City Sunday show offered this argument:
""According to what the governor is saying, logic would tell us, if we are wearing masks, we should see a reduction in cases if we went into, you know, from no masks to a mask. Or, if we went from a mask mandate to no masks, the governor’s logic would mean that we should see a significant decrease in cases. 
""Well, we’ve actually had that test take place, because back in May, the Legislature did not implement the mask mandate after it went away. And if you look at the numbers, we went from masks, to no masks, and there’s no significant difference in cases.""
We’ve looked at the science behind mask wearing, rating False a claim from a GOP Assembly member that wearing masks had been ""proven ineffective.""
But in this case, it’s less a science question than a history lesson.
Is Kapenga right that in May ""we went from masks, to no masks, and there (was) no significant difference in cases""?
In a word: No.
Kapenga off with his timeline 
When asked for backup for the claim, Kapenga’s office said the senator was referring to the natural experiment that took place when the state was placed under lockdown and what happened once Evers’ stay-at-home order was lifted.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







But that stay-at-home order, which began in March and ran until blocked by the Supreme Court in May, did not include a mask mandate.
The governor’s mask mandate did not begin until Aug. 1, and remains in effect. Indeed, it’s the very thing Republicans are in court fighting now.
On Oct. 12, 2020, St. Croix County Circuit Judge R. Michael Waterman denied a motion to suspend the mask mandate. That measure has been appealed.
While we are looking here at the timeline claimed by Kapenga, it’s worth a brief look at his broader argument -- that, if the mandate were successful, it should have resulted in sudden and dramatically lower case counts.
""In the roughly ten and a half weeks since the first mask mandate was enacted, the average daily positive test rate and the daily positive case rate have risen faster than when the state had no mandate or lockdowns,"" Kapenga said in the email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. 
But that suggests that the mask mandate is being strictly followed, when in many parts of the state it is being largely ignored -- including at campaign rallies for Trump.
And it ignores the fact that case counts have stayed lower in Milwaukee County, where the City of Milwaukee instituted a mask ordinance weeks earlier. And that in other states, a drop in cases did follow the institution of mask orders.
Our ruling
Kapenga claimed that in May, Wisconsin effectively had a test of mask effectiveness when ""we went from masks, to no masks, and there (was) no significant difference in cases.""
But Kapenga has his orders and lawsuits wrong. What was lifted in May, under a Republican lawsuit that went to the state Supreme Court, was Evers’ stay-at-home order. 
The governor’s mask mandate did not begin until Aug. 1, and remains in effect.

But three days later, on July 2, the website revised the article and replaced the original headline with this:

Here’s what Hayes said on his show, per a July 2 tweet from the show: 
""On Monday, I said that in Oklahoma, authorities tested 352 people for coronavirus over the weekend and found every test positive. They then tested another 178 people and found them all positive, as well. I was so incredulous over those numbers, I even checked the website of the Oklahoma State Department of Health to confirm those numbers before we went on air. Indeed, that is what is on the official website. We weren’t wrong. That’s what they report. The problem is, there is a lag in the way that Oklahoma reports its data. With fewer, but almost entirely positive tests being reported on the weekends, and then larger numbers, including negative tests bulk-reported later in the week. So, those numbers I cited on Monday did not provide a clear or complete picture because they were not the final numbers for Oklahoma’s weekend testing. I have a cardinal rule that I violated there, that if a statistic sounds too wild to be true, it probably is. I’m going to remind myself of that in the future.""
Oklahoma City TV reporter Dillon Richards had already knocked down the original article, tweeting: ""Not only are these dates incorrect (this is referring to Sunday and Monday) ... Oklahoma generally doesn't report negative tests on Sundays and Mondays, so the rate always appears to be 100% when it really isn't.""

There is no nationwide law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask.

 


The Facebook post comes from a blog post about an Illinois statute that prohibits carrying a firearm while wearing a face covering. Violating that law is punishable by a class four felony.

 


However, the Illinois State Police said the state’s COVID-19 mask requirements are not intended for lawful concealed-weapon permit holders.





See the sources for this fact-check




A popular meme of Kevin Hart and Keanu Reeves is spreading misinformation about face mask requirements and concealed-weapon permits.
Rapper King Chip shared the meme in a July 2 Facebook post. It shows a fictional exchange between Hart and Reeves.
""STOP! You have to wear a mask in here,"" the comedian says in the meme.
""I can’t, it’s a class 4 felony violating section 24-1(a)(9) prohibiting a mask while carrying a gun,"" the actor responds.

We’ve previously fact-checked inaccurate claims about face mask rules and concealed-weapon laws, so we wanted to investigate this Facebook post.
There is no federal law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask. The Facebook post comes from a blog post about an Illinois statute that prohibits carrying a firearm while wearing a face covering. But the Illinois State Police said that law does not apply to lawful concealed-weapon permit holders who abide by the state's COVID-19 mask requirements.
The claim stems from an April 25 article on a website called Illinois Leaks.
Illinois Leaks is run by the Edgar County Watchdogs, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization that aims to expose government corruption and waste. The article focuses on Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker’s April 30 executive order, which required the public to wear face coverings in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order went into effect May 1.
Illinois Leaks wrote that the order either ""strips a gun owner of his rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask, or makes them a criminal if they exercise their gun rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask.""

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







It does neither of those things.
The source of the Illinois Leaks article is a state statute that says it’s illegal for someone to carry a gun when ""hooded, robed or masked in such manner as to conceal his or her identity."" Violating that law is punishable by a class four felony, which comes with a maximum prison sentence of three years, or six years for an extended term.
On its face, the article seems to have a point about the letter of the law and Pritzker’s executive order. But the spirit of those rules paints a different picture.
A statement published in late April by the Illinois State Police says the executive order ""was not intended to negatively impact permit holders under the Illinois Concealed Carry Act while legally carrying firearms.""
""The executive order does not require or suggest that law enforcement should arrest or criminally charge conceal carry license permit holders for wearing protective masks while in public as long as they are complying with the other provisions of the Illinois Concealed Carry Act and are not committing any other violations of Illinois law,"" the state police said.
The Illinois attorney general’s office told us that it would be up to the discretion of local prosecutors whether to bring charges against someone for violating the statute. The state police said in its statement that it expects police officers ""will use appropriate judgment"" and state’s attorneys ""will likewise exercise sound prosecutorial discretion."" 
RELATED: No, wearing a mask doesn’t void concealed-carry permit
According to some tallies, about 15 states, as well as cities and counties, have anti-mask laws on the books that pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. Some states, especially those in the South, enacted those laws around the turn of the century to combat the Ku Klux Klan, whose members don white hoods.
One of those laws is in North Carolina. It prohibits people from covering their faces in public, but that law is currently suspended and does not mention firearms at all. We couldn’t find any other state where wearing a protective mask while carrying a concealed weapon is currently banned.
Our ruling
A Facebook post says wearing a face mask while carrying a firearm in public is a class four felony.
There is no federal law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask. There is a law against being ""hooded, robed or masked"" while carrying a gun in Illinois, but the Illinois State Police said the state’s COVID-19 mask requirements do not require law enforcement to arrest lawful concealed-weapon permit holders.

Rachel Maddow","What Trump said to encourage COVID-19 vaccine use




If Your Time is short





As president, Donald Trump expressed support for the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination by touting their life-saving potential and saying they would be safe and available to all. In a Dec. 17 tweet, he explicitly said, “Get those ‘shots’ everyone!”





See the sources for this fact-check




One day after former President Donald Trump urged Americans to ""go get your shot,"" the New York Times reported that he and first lady Melania Trump had quietly received their own COVID-19 vaccines on their way out of the White House in January.
The news rankled MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who criticized Trump as having failed to promote the vaccines during his time in the White House.
""While he was president, President Trump never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated,"" Maddow said March 1 on her prime-time TV show. ""Now we know that he himself took the vaccine in secret and never told anyone. What possible benefit was there to him to keep that secret from the public?""

""I mean, think about all the good that could have done,"" Maddow continued, citing recent polling that showed vaccine hesitancy is disproportionately high among Republican voters.
Trump had been a vaccine skeptic for years before he entered the White House. 
His under-the-radar vaccination marked a divergence from the example set by other officials who got their vaccines in front of TV cameras, including President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former Vice President Mike Pence.
But is it true that as president, Trump ""never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated,"" as Maddow claimed?
In short, no. Trump’s public comments about the vaccines were typically in reference to his administration’s efforts to fast-track their development. But in several cases, he touted the life-saving potential of the vaccines. And in a tweet, Trump gave the encouragement Maddow said he never did during his time in the White House.
""The Vaccine and the Vaccine rollout are getting the best of reviews,"" Trump tweeted Dec. 17, one day before the Food and Drug Administration cleared a second vaccine for use. ""Moving along really well. Get those ‘shots’ everyone!""

MSNBC did not offer comment for this fact-check. But after PolitiFact reached out, Maddow showed Trump’s December tweet on air as part of a correction. 
""I thought when we reported last night that while he was president, he had actually never told Americans to get vaccinated,"" Maddow said March 2. ""It turns out he did say, in one tweet in December, that everybody should get their shots.""
What Trump said, and what he didn’t say
Maddow’s original comments echoed the New York Times’ report about Trump’s private vaccination. The newspaper wrote that Trump’s ""go get your shot"" comment at the Conservative Political Action Conference Feb. 28 was ""the first time he encouraged people to go get vaccinated,"" and that ""he never publicly encouraged people to take it while he was in office."" That is not accurate. The New York Times did not respond to requests for comment.
PolitiFact reviewed months of Trump’s vaccine comments using Factba.se, an interactive transcript website that tracked his public statements throughout his presidency.
Trump’s ""get those ‘shots’ everyone"" comment from December was a specific example we found of him publicly and explicitly urging people to get vaccinated. But the former president signaled his support in many other ways, expressing hope that the vaccines, once tested and approved, would end the pandemic and help bring about a return to normal life. 
For months leading up to the arrival of the first vaccines, Trump feverishly claimed credit for their quick development. At campaign rallies, he told supporters a vote for Biden would ""delay the vaccine,"" while a vote for him would result in a vaccine to ""quickly eradicate the virus.""

The COVID-19 vaccines make people ""magnetized. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick.""












By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







As clinical trials were getting underway, Trump said in a September press conference that he ""encourage(d) everybody to enroll, as many people as we can,"" in the trials.
The vaccines, he said, should go first to frontline workers, the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions. They would not be mandated, he said, but they would be widely available.
Trump attended a White House summit celebrating the expected approval of the first vaccines. ""Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine,"" Trump said Dec. 8.
Even as he repeatedly claimed, falsely, that the U.S. was rounding the corner on the pandemic without vaccines, Trump continued to tout the progress on development, saying at one October rally: ""We have unbelievable vaccines that are coming out real soon.""
By the time the first vaccine was cleared for use, Trump had lost his reelection bid, and his public comments focused more on promoting false claims about the election. A few weeks later, following the U.S. Capitol riot, Trump was barred from Twitter, his preferred communication tool.
Top government officials publicly urged him to encourage people to get the vaccine, and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany promised he would do so because ""he wants to see all Americans get this vaccine."" But behind the scenes, Trump declined to be the face of the vaccination campaign, instead letting Pence handle the load, the Associated Press reported. 
Trump was vague about when he would be inoculated, writing in a Dec. 14 tweet, ""I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.""
But Trump also celebrated the rollout of the vaccines on Twitter. He repeatedly said that the vaccine was a ""miracle,"" that it was ""safe and effective,"" and that it would end the pandemic.
""It will save millions of lives, and soon end the pandemic once and for all,"" Trump said Dec. 11, the day the FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use.

""These vaccines are also very safe,"" Trump continued. ""American citizens participated in clinical trials that were far larger than normal, and had no serious side effects. The dedicated and independent experts at the FDA meticulously studied the results of the trials, and it has now passed the gold standard of safety."" 
In remarks toward the end of the year, Trump said the world would benefit from the vaccines and held up the rollout as a historic medical achievement.
Some health experts said Trump could have done more.
Peter Hotez, from the Baylor College of Medicine, said on CNN that if Trump had regularly encouraged Americans to take the vaccine, it would have made a ""big difference,"" especially among his followers, who have relatively high vaccine skepticism, polling shows.
""If the president had been out there touting the impact of vaccines, we would have melted away a lot of that chunk of vaccine hesitancy and vaccine refusal, I believe,"" Hotez said.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said he wasn’t aware that Trump got vaccinated. He called it a ""lost opportunity"" to persuade vaccine hesitant people to get shots.
""That would’ve been an extraordinarily good opportunity to get a signal to the people who would clearly have listened to him the way they listened to him in many other ways,"" said Fauci, who got his own shot on camera. ""He has a great deal of influence.""
Our ruling
Maddow said, ""While he was president, President Trump never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated.""
Trump expressed confidence in the vaccines and vaccination in many different ways — on Twitter and in public remarks — touting their life-saving potential and saying they would be safe and available to all.

Facebook posts","President Obama declared H1N1 a public health emergency before anyone in the United States died




If Your Time is short





The Obama administration declared swine flu, or H1N1, a public health emergency six weeks before H1N1 was declared a pandemic.


No H1N1 deaths had yet been recorded in the United States.


Six months after that initial declaration, when more than 1,000 deaths had occurred, Obama himself declared H1N1 a national emergency.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus is being defended with an attack on how President Barack Obama handled the outbreak of H1N1, also known as swine flu, in 2009.
The headline of an article shared on Facebook made this claim:
""Flashback: Obama waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The article was published on Prntly, which describes itself as a conservative news website that defends Trump. The article goes on to say that ""it wasn’t until six months after"" H1N1 became a global pandemic that ""then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S.""
Not only is this timeline wrong, but the story and headline eliminate important facts and distort others, imparting a false narrative that social media users are resharing.
Let’s take a look.
Online, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.  
The H1N1 virus 
The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world. 
It was originally referred to as ""swine flu"" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America.
It was serious. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, in the United States, there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated.
Obama and his administration issued two emergency declarations, but the article refers only to one.
Obama acted before pandemic declared
Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency on April 26, 2009.
That was when only 20 cases of H1N1 — and no deaths — around the country had been confirmed.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Two days later, the administration made an initial funding request for H1N1 to Congress. Eventually $7.65 billion was allocated for a vaccine and other measures.
H1N1 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on June 11, 2009.
In other words, the Obama administration’s public health emergency declaration came more than six weeks before the pandemic designation.
Now to Obama’s second action.
On Oct. 24, 2009, six months after his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency, Obama declared it a national emergency. 
At that point, H1N1 had claimed more than 1,000 American lives, according to the CDC.
When Obama made his declaration, the New York Times reported at the time, thousands of people were lining up in cities across the country to receive vaccinations, as federal officials acknowledged that their vaccination program had gotten off to a slow start, with some states having requested 10 times the amount they have been allotted.
Millions of people in the United States had had H1N1.
The national emergency declaration allowed the federal government to temporarily waive or modify requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs. It also permitted doctors and hospitals to bypass certain requirements as they responded to H1N1.
By way of comparison, Trump declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Jan. 31, 2020, also prior to any deaths in the United States. One effect was that U.S. citizens who had been in China's Hubei Province, the source of the outbreak, in the previous 14 days were subjected to 14 days of mandatory quarantine if they traveled back to the United States.
NBC News reported March 3, 2020, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is planning for the possibility that Trump could make a national emergency declaration to bring in extra funds and personnel to assist the administration's coronavirus response.
Our ruling
The headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed: ""Obama waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died.""
In October 2009, after more than 1,000 people in the United States had died of swine flu, also known as H1N1, Obama declared a national emergency.
But six months earlier, his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. At that point, no deaths in the United States had occurred.

Facebook posts","No, chip on COVID-19 vaccine syringes would not be injected or track people




If Your Time is short





COVID-19 vaccines do not include microchips for tracking patients.


A medical technology company has been producing prefilled syringes for coronavirus vaccines. The syringes can include an optional chip on the label — not inside the injected dose itself — that would show if a particular dose is expired or counterfeit. 


The chips would not be injected with the vaccine, nor would they gather information on patients or allow their locations to be tracked.





See the sources for this fact-check




A video circulating on social media wrongly claims that some COVID-19 vaccines could include microchips to let government officials track patients. That’s inaccurate.
The Dec. 9 video spread on Facebook and Instagram as the U.S. distributed its first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The video pulls from a May interview with Jay Walker, executive chairman of ApiJect Systems Corp., a medical technology company. In the interview, Walker described how ApiJect’s prefilled syringes could include optional chips to show when a vaccine dose is expired or counterfeit.
The video uses selective editing and misleading text overlays to give the impression that the ApiJect’s radio-frequency identification technology would enable government officials to track the vaccinated population. 
""The chip would give officials information on who has and has not been vaccinated, as well as when doses expire,"" the text over the video says. ""The chip tracks the location of the patient.""

A pair of screenshots from a social media video falsely claiming some COVID-19 vaccines could include microchips to track patients.
But in reality, the optional chip would be on the syringe label, spokespersons for ApiJect and the Department of Health and Human Services told PolitiFact. It would not be injected into patients with the vaccine, nor would it allow those patients to be tracked in any way.
Fact-checkers from Reuters and Lead Stories previously debunked the video’s claims. Elizabeth Johnston, who describes herself as a blogger, author and activist, posted the video with a watermark from her website. We reached out to her, but she did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Patients won’t be tracked or have chip injected with vaccine
In his May interview with CBN News, Walker described ApiJect’s partnership with the U.S. government to expand production of injection devices for a future COVID-19 vaccine. The company had recently entered into a $138 million contract with the Pentagon and HHS. (In the interview, Walker is misidentified as ApiJect’s CEO.)
The interviewer asked Walker about ""the optional RFID chip"" on the prefilled syringes that could help health workers tell if a vaccine dose was expired or counterfeit.

""What that chip does is it has the unique serial number for each dose,"" Walker said. ""It is designed so that there is no counterfeiting. It is designed so that we'll know exactly that the right dose hasn't expired.""
Walker went on to explain that the chip ""only refers to the dose"" of the vaccine in the prefilled syringe. ""There’s no personal information, no patient information,"" he said. ""It's simply like a barcode. Only we know instantaneously where and when that dose has been used.""
But the video circulating on social media omits that section of the interview. It mutes Walker’s words and, in a text overlay on the screen, says the chip ""would give officials information on who has and has not been vaccinated"" and ""tracks the location of the patient.""
Steven Hofman, a spokesperson for ApiJect, rejected the video’s claims. ""No chip is vaccinated into anyone,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact.
The technology is optional for purchasers of the syringes and ""would go on the label on the outside of the container holding the vaccine,"" Hofman said. So far, it hasn’t been requested by any government or private company, he said. And if it were, it wouldn’t be able to track people.
""The chip does not and will not collect any personal information on who is vaccinated,"" Hofman said. The chips could record where each shot was administered, but they ""would not and could not record information on who has been vaccinated.""
The chips could also help keep tabs on the devices as they ship to pharmacies and other locations for vaccine administration, an HHS spokesperson said in a statement. 
""The video is inaccurate,"" the statement said. ""ApiJect technology doesn’t inject a microchip into a person receiving the vaccine.""
PolitiFact has debunked numerous false claims about tracking devices in vaccines. Experts previously said microchips are too large to be injected when patients are vaccinated.
""Even the smallest version of RFID chips are rather large, such that none would ever fit into a vaccine needle,"" Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, told PolitiFact in April.
Our ruling
A Facebook video said an optional microchip for COVID-19 vaccines ""would give officials information on who has and has not been vaccinated"" and ""tracks the location of the patient.""
The chips are part of the label for ApiJect’s prefilled syringes, and they help identify the vaccine doses, not patients. They would not be injected into patients seeking the vaccine, nor would they be used to track information and locations.

The WHO test lacked FDA approval because it was never submitted to the FDA for evaluation.

A persistent but inaccurate talking point is that the United States turned down coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization. We found that WHO never offered kits to the United States, and when a reporter asked President Donald Trump if that was true, he confirmed, and took it a step further.
""No. 1, nothing was offered,"" Trump said March 17. ""No. 2, it was a bad test.""
There is zero evidence that the WHO’s preferred test is unreliable.
Based on a test developed in Berlin, Germany, by the end of February, WHO had purchased and sent materials to over 100 countries for 1.4 million tests.
A review from the National University of Singapore reported that the German test gave neither false positives, nor false negatives. In technical terms, it was ""highly sensitive and specific,"" and did not ""cross-react with other coronaviruses.""
Before Trump spoke, top officials explained that the United States wanted a test that came through American commercial vendors and had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

If Your Time is short



• Oklahoma’s daily caseload has risen consistently in June, and to levels higher than at any point in the pandemic.



See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump is receiving criticism for his decision to restart in-person, indoor rallies with an event in Tulsa on June 20. During a White House roundtable on June 15, Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump’s decision by praising Oklahoma’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
At a discussion of issues affecting older Americans, Pence said, ""The president and I have both spoken to (Oklahoma) Gov. Kevin Stitt in the last several days and even earlier today. And Oklahoma has really been in the forefront of our efforts to slow the spread. And in a very real sense, they've flattened the curve. And today, their hospital capacity is abundant. The number of cases in Oklahoma — it's declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward with the rally this coming weekend.""
However, Pence’s remarks represent an unduly optimistic reading of Oklahoma’s actual coronavirus data. (The Trump campaign and the White House did not respond to inquiries.)
The state opened some businesses on April 24 and others on May 1.
We looked at the raw data for Oklahoma from the Covid Tracking Project. The following chart shows both the daily number of new, confirmed cases in Oklahoma and the seven-day rolling average, which smooths out day-to-day variations in the data. (For instance, weekends often show artificially low totals because offices are closed.)

 
The strongest evidence for Pence’s characterization comes in the early part of the period. From early March to early April, the daily case count skyrocketed, but then it eased and remained more or less in check through the end of May. 
This fits the pattern of ""flattening the curve,"" a term that gained currency early in the pandemic to describe a hoped-for phenomenon by which Americans would stay at home to stop the virus’ spread, thus keeping new infections from overwhelming the hospital system.
However, Pence overstated the case.

First, it’s incorrect to say that infections in Oklahoma ""declined precipitously."" As the chart shows, it was, at best, a modest decline between early April and the end of May. It could be more accurately described as a plateau.
Second, any ""flattening the curve"" period is old news. Over the most recent week, the number of new cases has increased every day and produced a spike beyond anything previously seen in Oklahoma. The seven-day rolling average for new infections is now more than double where it stood at the end of May, just before the spike began.
""It looks from the data that the number of cases is on the rise, and rising quite steeply,"" said Nicole Gatto, associate professor in the School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University.
Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, agreed.
""The seven-day average doesn't look great for the most recent part of June,"" Smith said. ""They had slowed new cases for a while, but the trend now seems to be reversing.""
Equally important, the recent spike does not appear to be traceable to a big surge in testing. Here’s a chart of the seven-day rolling average of daily tests in Oklahoma:

The number of tests conducted has generally risen over time. But the number of tests actually fell during the period when the number of new infections was spiking. 
Our ruling
Pence said, ""In a very real sense, (Oklahoma has) flattened the curve. ... The number of cases in Oklahoma — it's declined precipitously.""
This observation is outdated and inaccurate. In June, Oklahoma’s daily caseload has risen consistently, and to levels higher than at any point in the pandemic.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump wrong that greater testing is driving coronavirus case load




If Your Time is short



• If increased testing were the only reason for a surge in new cases, the percentage of positive tests should be dropping or at least remaining about the same.
• That pattern did occur from early April to early June, a period when the availability of testing expanded significantly. 
• However, that’s no longer the case. Since early June, the amount of testing being conducted has continued to reach new highs, yet the positivity rate has risen by a full percentage point.



See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump’s explanation for rising counts of U.S. coronavirus cases is that we’re testing more people for the virus.
On June 23, Trump tweeted, ""Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!!""
Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!! https://t.co/bKFmgOLEGZ— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 23, 2020 
We’ll look at his statement on mortality in a separate fact-check. In this article we’ll focus on his mistaken connection between increased testing and increased cases.
While the number of coronavirus tests being conducted is rising over time, the positivity rate — which is the percentage of tests that come up positive for the virus — has also been rising since early June. And that undermines Trump’s argument.

The following chart shows that the number of tests across the country has risen steadily since late March. The orange line shows how the positivity rate has changed over time.

 
Initially, the rise in tests did show the pattern Trump touted: As more tests were conducted, the percentage of positive results declined. After peaking above 20% positive in early April, the positivity rate fell to about 4% in early June. 
A likely reason for this pattern is that early in the pandemic, tests were scarce and were reserved for people who showed visible symptoms. As testing kits became more widely accessible for people without obvious symptoms, a wider cross-section of the population was tested, with a resulting decline in tests showing the patient was infected.
The problem for Trump’s assertion is that the decline in the positive rate reversed itself in early June.
The positivity rate bottomed out around June 10 at about 4.3%. By June 22, it had risen to about 5.3%.

That may not sound like a big increase, but if more infections are being tallied simply because more tests are being given, as Trump suggested, the positivity rate should be going down, or at least staying about the same, not rising.
""The up-turn in positive rate is sufficient to debunk"" what Trump said about testing, ""particularly given that the total number tests conducted is at its highest yet, and still we see an increase in the seven-day rolling positive rate,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.
The rise in the positivity rate appears to be driven by a handful of states.
Early coronavirus hot spots, notably New York, have seen a decline in new infections despite widespread testing. But other states are seeing both an increase in infections and an increase in the percentage of positive tests.
In Arizona, Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, the positivity rate has increased consistently since late May.

 
The White House told PolitiFact that anecdotally, the increased testing has uncovered a growing number of people who are asymptomatic or who have mild or moderate cases than earlier in the pandemic, when tests were hard to get. 
However, an increase in the number of infections also means the potential for accelerated spread.
Our ruling
Trump said that the coronavirus case count is ""up only because of our big number testing.""
Testing has increased nationally, but epidemiologists say that if this were the only reason that new cases were rising, the percentage of positive tests should be dropping or at least remaining about the same.
That pattern did occur from early April to early June, a period when the availability of testing expanded significantly. However, that’s no longer the case.

Darin LaHood","LaHood overstates Chicago’s share of Illinois COVID-19 cases




If Your Time is short




Arguing his region of the state should be allowed to start reopening, the congressman said Chicago accounts for nearly all cases of the novel coronavirus in Illinois.
But state public health data show the city makes up less than half of the state’s total.




See the sources for this fact-check




Calling for restrictions under the state’s stay-at-home order to be relaxed in his west-central Illinois district, U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood claimed Chicago accounts for the vast majority of the state’s COVID-19 cases.
""Peoria is not like Chicago,"" LaHood told a CBS affiliate in Peoria. ""93% of the cases in the state of Illinois have come from Chicago … There has to be a tiered system, a more measured and a balanced approach.""
LaHood, a Republican who represents Illinois’ 18th Congressional District, which includes Peoria, made those remarks May 1 after Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker acknowledged some regions may be ready to reopen sooner than others depending on when they pass their peak.
While there’s no doubt major urban centers with large, concentrated populations have seen a higher number of confirmed positive cases, LaHood’s figure for Chicago — where about 20% of the state’s 12.7 million residents reside — seemed improbably high.
On the day he made his claim, the number of cases in Chicago had reached 22,700, about 40% of the state’s 56,000 cases at the time, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. Chicago’s share of the total hasn’t varied much in the days since, the same dataset shows. LaHood’s own Peoria County has seen just 148 positive cases.
Debates over how and when to resume different kinds of business and other activities have raged across states as the nation continues to confront both a rising death toll and historic surges in unemployment.
Pritzker has since released a plan to gradually reopen Illinois that divides the state into four regions. None of the counties LaHood represents are included in the same region as Chicago. Some businesses, such as restaurants, would not open anywhere until the end of June at the earliest under the plan. LaHood said it’s ""unrealistic"" for Downstate regions to wait that long.
When we asked LaHood’s office for evidence of his claim, a spokesperson indicated LaHood was referencing an area that included Chicago and the northern part of the state.
""Northern or upstate IL and Chicago, as of last week, accounted for approximately 93% of the cases, and ‘Northern’ was inadvertently left out during the interview,"" a spokesman wrote in an email.
Asked if LaHood misspoke when he cited Chicago instead of ""upstate"" or ""northern"" Illinois, we got no response.

Had LaHood referred to counties in northern Illinois that include the Chicago metropolitan region, he would have found himself on much firmer ground. The vast majority of the state’s cases have occurred in Cook County and the five counties that surround it: DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will. Together, those six counties are home to about two-thirds of Illinois residents but accounted for 90% of the state’s COVID-19 cases as of May 13.
It’s common for residents outside of the Chicagoland area to refer to the significantly larger and more populous northeastern region collectively as ""Chicago,"" according to state political experts. But they said the inaccuracy reinforces regional stereotypes.
""If you’re already disposed to think of things as us versus them, then that’s reinforcing that narrative,"" said Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois Springfield. ""But it’s not precise, it’s not accurate … If you’re referring to northeastern Illinois, then be specific about what you’re referring to.""
Our ruling
LaHood said 93% of COVID-19 cases in Illinois ""have come from Chicago.""
Confirmed cases in Illinois’ largest city account for less than half of the state’s total cases, public health data show. That’s far from the figure LaHood cited during his TV appearance.
LaHood’s spokesperson said he was referring to the northern region of the state more broadly, but experts told us that’s no excuse.

Tom Reed","State holds power over school re-openings




If Your Time is short




Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in March, and subsequently closed schools by executive order.
During a state of emergency, the state holds power over local entities, such as school districts. 




See the sources for this fact-check




Rep. Tom Reed weighed into the debate over how to begin the new school year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It should be up to local authorities - not the state - to establish their re-opening plans, Reed said. 
""I caught the governor’s comment yesterday that ‘opening the schools is not the president’s choice,’"" Reed said during a news conference in Buffalo on July 9. ""That’s true. That is a local determination, but it’s not a state determination."" 
Reed, a Republican from Corning who said he wants to see schools re-open, said that the state ""should defer to the local school districts, and the superintendents, and the school boards. They’re the ones that know their school districts."" 
He added: ""It’s not the governor’s call either. It’s the local officials that should be doing that."" 
Since reopening schools matters to parents, teachers and employers among many others, we wondered if Reed is correct, that the decision to reopen is a local determination, not a state one. 
Range of opinions
We consulted with five people who work in education and know New York well, including lawyers, people who study education and a representative of school superintendents. 
Their opinions differed on Reed’s statement. Some said an argument could be made for local or state authorities holding the power, while others said that executive authority during an emergency gives the governor control. Another said the state has authority over the districts regardless of whether a state of emergency has been declared. 
During an emergency, the governor has complete authority to open and close public schools, said Brian Backstrom, director of education policy studies at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York. The details of how schools will operate will be left to the state Board of Regents in consultation with districts, but the governor will set the standards for when districts can be open, Backstrom said. 

 
A spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Jason Conwall, said that schools typically have local authority, but that during a declared emergency, the governor’s powers supersede local governments. The schools were closed by an executive order, Conwall said, and will be reopened by one. 
Conwall directed us to several executive orders that Cuomo has issued since the coronavirus became a concern in New York, including 202.4, which closed ""every school in the state of New York"" by March 18, for two weeks. It was subsequently extended by other orders. On May 7, executive order 202.28 closed schools through the end of the school year. These orders stipulated that state aid would not be lost by the districts because they are closed. An executive order on June 5 allowed for in-person special education instruction for summer school. A subsequent order, 202.45, issued June 26, continued to close schools to in-person instruction, except for special education.  
The executive director of an organization that advocates for public school students said that districts are creations of state governments, and that states have authority over opening and closing, even in non-emergency situations. 
""When you think about it legally, in New York, like in all 50 states, (states) are required to maintain and support public school systems,"" said David Sciarra of the Education Law Center, which is based in New Jersey and is partially funded by teachers’ unions.

""Authority is granted by the state, period, pandemic or not,"" he said. 
But some experts said that in times when an emergency has not been declared by the governor, the circumstances would be different. 
Several, including Robert Lowry, deputy director for advocacy, research and communications at the New York State Council of School Superintendents, said that public schools must be in session for 180 days in New York or they risk losing state aid for every day they are not in session. 
""A district could elect to remain closed, but few districts would be willing to go more than a few days losing aid,"" Lowry said. 
Lowry pointed to Section 3604 of state education law, which provides that the state education commissioner may forgive state aid penalties for ""any day or days on which session had been previously scheduled but the superintendent was required to close the school or schools due to a properly executed declaration of a state or local state of emergency."" Cuomo signed such an executive order on March 7.  
Kathryn McCary, an education lawyer based in Schenectady, said that although public school districts have ""significant local autonomy"" and are funded with property taxes raised locally, they are dependent upon state aid, as well as federal funding for certain programs. ""So yes, it is theoretically a local decision, but it isn’t an unconstrained one,"" she said. 
David Bloomfield, an education lawyer and professor at Brooklyn College and The CUNY Graduate Center, said that in New York, reopening would typically be a local determination, as long as the district meets the statutory 180-day minimum attendance requirement. But Cuomo, under executive powers conferred to him by the Legislature, has emergency authority that preempts local school boards. 
We also approached Reed’s office for evidence of his claim. 
""School districts in collaboration with other local elected officials, teachers, and parents, as opposed to one-size-fits-all mandates from Albany, should determine school reopenings,"" Reed said in a statement. ""Members of our school boards are duly elected by the communities they serve and are in the best position to determine the appropriate course of action for their students and teachers, including when to safely reopen.""
In April, PolitiFact New York found that both New York state and New York City had authority to close New York City schools.  
Our ruling
Reed said that the decision to open schools is not a state determination. School calendars are typically set by districts, as long as they can meet the state’s 180-day statutory requirement. 
During this pandemic, however, the governor closed the schools by executive order, and Cuomo’s spokesman said that he will be opening them by executive order. A few days after  Reed made his statement, the executive branch and the state Education Department announced guidelines and detailed what should be contained in plans for re-opening.
If districts do not work with the state, and seek its approval for their reopening plans, they could lose state funding.

Bloggers","Websites spin unproven link between Canada, China about coronavirus outbreak




A widely shared article on social media inaccurately claims Canada is the source of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak in China.
Zero Hedge, a blog with a track record of publishing false information, said in a Jan. 26 story that the coronavirus is part of a Chinese plot to develop a bioweapon. The article was republished from a website called Great Game India.
""Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab,"" the story reads. ""Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.""
The story weaves together unrelated facts to construct a conspiracy theory. Officials are still trying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak, but there’s no evidence of it being created for use as a bioweapon.

(Screenshot from Zero Hedge)
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The virus, which originated in the central China city of Wuhan, has infected more than 4,000 people worldwide, and China has restricted travel within the country amid a rising death toll.
The Canadian lab
Great Game India claims that the current coronavirus outbreak can be traced to Chinese agents who infiltrated a Canadian lab to steal virus samples. But there’s no evidence for that.
The story focuses on the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. In 2013, researchers there were investigating a new cluster of coronavirus infections that appeared to have originated in Saudi Arabia. 
Great Game India implies that disease is the same one that’s currently affecting China. But the lab was examining the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. (There are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans.)

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Great Game India goes on to claim that Chinese scientists working in the Canadian lab were ""bio-warfare agents"" and took the samples to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
One of the scientists mentioned in the Great Game India story, Xiangguo Qiu, is under investigation for a possible ""policy breach"" after she was invited to the Wuhan lab twice a year for two years. Qiu, her husband and her students from China were removed from the lab in July 2019.
There are questions about what information Qiu shared with Chinese officials while visiting Wuhan, and the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory has sent viruses to China in the past for research. But there is no evidence to support the claim that Qiu stole coronavirus samples and gave them to the Wuhan lab to create biological weapons.
The Wuhan lab
The assertion that the origin of the coronavirus outbreak is a Chinese lab near Wuhan also lacks evidence.
The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and the SARS coronavirus. Some experts have linked the lab to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons.
""Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus,"" the Great Game India story reads.
As of now, however, the lab’s proximity to the seafood market is a coincidence, as there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the coronavirus outbreak.
RELATED: No, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus
The CDC and the World Health Organization are still investigating the cause of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the CDC said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus.
Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."" Early reports suggested that the disease appeared to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States.
Our ruling
A Zero Hedge story claims that Chinese agents stole coronavirus samples from Canada to create a biological weapon, which has now caused an outbreak of the disease around the world.
A Chinese scientist who worked in a Canadian lab studying coronaviruses is under investigation for trips she took to Wuhan. But there’s no evidence she gave China coronavirus samples to develop a biological weapon. Plus, the lab worked on MERS, not the Wuhan coronavirus.

Chain message","Audio shared on Facebook Messenger spreads false information about coronavirus prevention




If Your Time is short





An audio message lists 10 ways people can avoid contracting COVID-19. We fact-checked five of the most questionable claims.


There is no evidence that sipping water every 20 minutes or exposing your clothing to the sun can help prevent the coronavirus.


Officials advise people to wash their hands, but not every 20 minutes, as the message claims. There’s also no evidence that consuming cold things makes you more susceptible to the virus.


There’s no proof that the coronavirus can live for up to nine days on metallic surfaces. A preliminary study suggests it can remain viable on stainless steel for up to three days.





See the sources for this fact-check




A false post about COVID-19 is being shared in a new format on Facebook.
In an audio message that a reader sent us on March 23, a woman with a British accent lists 10 ways that people can avoid being infected with the coronavirus. The message claims to be based on research from Chinese scientists.
""It was sent to me by a colleague who has a friend that works at Dr. Negrin, which is the main hospital on our island,"" says the woman on the audio message. ""It’s obviously in Spanish, so I’m just going to read it and translate it for you.""
University Hospital of Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin is located in the city of Las Palmas on Gran Canaria, one of Spain’s Canary Islands. The island chain’s tourism industry has been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here’s some of the questionable medical advice in the audio message that caught our eye:

""Take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes""
Hang clothes ""in direct sunlight, which also neutralizes the virus""
""Wash your hands every 20 minutes""
""Try to avoid eating and drinking cold things""
""Wash metallic surfaces very carefully because the virus can remain viable on these for up to nine days""

If some of those claims sound familiar, it’s because many of them have been circulating on social media in some form since January, when the World Health Organization addressed a slew of COVID-19 rumors on Twitter. We’ve also debunked several bogus coronavirus prevention and treatment methods.
But this audio message was new to us, so we decided to check out each of the five claims. All of them either lack evidence or have been debunked by public health officials.
""Take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes""
This is inaccurate — we rated a similar claim False.
While health experts recommend drinking water regularly to stay healthy, there is no evidence that sipping some every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. 
The primary way the virus spreads is through close contact with infected people and respiratory droplets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When someone with the coronavirus coughs or sneezes, their germs land on surfaces around them. The virus then infects people who touch those surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
So to prevent contracting the coronavirus, the CDC advises people to avoid touching their face as much as possible. Other ways to prevent infection include washing your hands with soap and water, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and regularly sanitizing the surfaces in your home or at your workstation. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus.
In a tweet published Feb. 7, the WHO said it does not advise people to drink water as a way to avoid coronavirus infection.
Hang clothes ""in direct sunlight, which also neutralizes the virus""
While air-drying your clothes may save you some money on your electricity bill, there is no evidence it will kill the coronavirus. We’ve rated similar claims False.
There is ample evidence that viruses, including human coronaviruses, don’t like heat. Influenza, for example, thrives in dry, cold weather, which is one reason the flu season typically spans from fall to spring. And high-intensity UV light can kill viruses. 
RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself
But that doesn’t mean sun exposure kills the coronavirus. Experts told us natural sunlight doesn’t provide the UV intensity needed to kill the virus, and the WHO says on its website that COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, ""including areas with hot and humid weather.""
Neither the WHO nor the CDC lists sunlight exposure as a method to kill the coronavirus. In fact, the WHO has debunked the claim, saying ""there is no evidence that sunlight kills the new coronavirus.""
""Wash your hands every 20 minutes""
Public health officials say washing your hands is one of the primary ways to prevent COVID-19 infection. But if you’re healthy and in self-isolation, there is probably little reason to lather up so frequently.
The CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time — ""especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







On its website, UNICEF lists a few more examples of when people should wash their hands: ""after touching surfaces outside the home, including money; before, during and after caring for a sick person; and before and after eating.""
So if you’re doing any of those things every 20 minutes, you may want to wash your hands. 
""Try to avoid eating and drinking cold things""
This claim is baseless.
As we’ve covered before, there is evidence that human coronaviruses don’t like heat. But just as there’s no scientific proof that hot things prevent COVID-19, there’s no proof that cold things make you more susceptible.
This claim is similar to one made in a fake UNICEF handout that circulated on Facebook in early March. It said people should ""stay away from ice cream and eating cold"" to avoid contracting COVID-19.
In a statement, UNICEF debunked that claim. On its website, the WHO did, too.
""There is no scientific evidence that eating hygienically made frozen food and ice-cream spreads the new coronavirus,"" the organization says.
""Wash metallic surfaces very carefully because the virus can remain viable on these for up to nine days""
There’s no evidence to support this.
An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17 tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard.
""SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),"" the authors wrote. ""SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.""
RELATED: Novel coronavirus could live up to 3 days, depending on the surface
Aside from air, the least hospitable medium for the virus was copper; researchers could detect viable virus particles there for only up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel — up to three days.
That’s far from nine days, as the audio message claimed. And while the journal article hasn’t been peer-reviewed, its findings are similar to those of other researchers.
An article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about the surface viability of various coronaviruses that infect humans, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19. The authors wrote that scientists found some of these viruses could live for up to five days on steel, and eight hours on aluminum. Another study they cited found a SARS virus strain remaining viable for up to five days on an unspecified metal.
The article did find that one strain of SARS could live for up to nine days on plastic surfaces. But two other strains of the virus remained viable for only five days or less, and MERS could live for only up to 48 hours at a certain temperature.
More recently, a March 23 report from the CDC said novel coronavirus RNA was found on surfaces on the Diamond Princess cruise ship 17 days after passengers disembarked. That finding raised questions about whether the coronavirus can last longer on some surfaces than previously thought, but researchers have noted that viral RNA doesn’t necessarily mean live virus was present.
Our ruling
A chain audio message on Facebook Messenger lists 10 ways to prevent infection from COVID-19. We fact-checked five and found them inaccurate.
First, there is no evidence that sipping water every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. There is also no evidence that exposing your clothing to the sun will kill the coronavirus.
Health officials recommend that people avoid touching their face and wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at a time —  not every 20 minutes, as the message claims. There’s also no evidence that consuming cold things makes you more susceptible to the virus.
Finally, while the science is far from settled, there’s no proof that the coronavirus can live for up to nine days on metallic surfaces. The best available evidence suggests that it can remain viable on stainless steel for up to three days.
We rate the claims False.

Ron DeSantis","No indication that Biden administration is planning to shut down the Florida border




If Your Time is short



• An anonymous official told the Miami Herald that the Biden administration was considering domestic travel restrictions on states where the UK COVID-19 variant is surging, including Florida. However, it’s unclear so far what particular domestic travel regulations the administration is weighing and how they would be implemented. 
• No one has suggested closing Florida’s border. It’s not clear if a president has the authority to shut down a state border. 
• DeSantis previously placed travel restrictions on people flying to Florida from New York. ​



See the sources for this fact-check




Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent out a fundraising plea attacking the Biden administration for considering domestic travel restrictions in an effort to curb the spread of a highly contagious COVID-19 variant. 
President Joe Biden ""is trying to shut FL’s border,"" DeSantis texted potential donors. In an accompanying email, DeSantis said: ""Joe Biden is considering treating Florida like East Berlin and shutting down our border over ‘coronavirus concerns.’""
Is that so?
We found no indication of anything so dramatic.
We reached out to DeSantis’s office and asked where they had gotten the information that the Biden administration was planning to shut down the Florida border. Cody McCloud, a DeSantis spokesperson, did not answer our questions directly and instead referred us to a Twitter video posted to the governor’s account. What he says in the video is far less sweeping than what he claimed in the fundraising email.
DeSantis’ fundraising message followed a front-page article in the Miami Herald on Feb. 10. The story quoted an anonymous government official saying that the Biden administration was considering new domestic travel restrictions for regions affected by the highly contagious U.K. strain of the coronavirus. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that Florida currently has a third of the nation’s cases of the U.K. COVID-19 variant. 
But according to the Herald, the White House has not said that it is considering a Florida travel ban.
It’s unclear so far what particular domestic travel regulations the administration is weighing and how they would be implemented. The administration has not publicly discussed a border shutdown as an option.
One possible restriction could be to require travelers to show negative COVID-19 test results before they take domestic flights.
During a Feb. 7 interview, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that the Biden administration was considering this idea. Such a requirement would not apply to Florida in particular, but to the U.S. more broadly.

Desantis imposed travel restrictions on travelers from some states earlier in the pandemic. On March 23, 2020, he required travelers from coronavirus hot spots like New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to self-quarantine for 14 days. Later that month, he ordered the Florida Highway Patrol to set up checkpoints on a highway connecting Florida and Louisiana. 
In public appearances, Biden spokespeople and federal officials have stressed that no policy announcements regarding travel restrictions are coming soon. 
""We are always considering what steps are necessary to keep the American people safe, but we are not currently in the process of… No decisions have been made around additional public health measures that would delay or would change, I should say, domestic travel considerations,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Feb. 11.
The Miami Herald story quoted two anonymous federal officials who said that ""no policy announcements are imminent,"" and that ""any move to restrict travel or impose new health measures would be taken in partnership with state and local governments.""
It’s not clear that the president has the power to close a state border.
The right of Americans to travel interstate in the United States has never been substantially judicially questioned or limited, according to Meryl Justin Chertoff, the executive director of the Georgetown Project on State and Local Government Policy and Law.
""The baseline ... is that freedom of movement within and between states is constitutionally protected,"" Chertoff wrote.

Desantis said Biden is trying to close Florida’s border.

Instagram posts","Fact-checking unproven claims that rapper DMX suffered heart attack after getting COVID-19 vaccine




If Your Time is short





The rapper DMX died April 9 after suffering a heart attack days earlier. Statements from his family and the hospital did not mention a COVID-19 vaccine. Murray Richman, DMX’s longtime attorney, told PolitiFact that DMX did not die from a COVID-19 vaccine.


The claims that DMX received his COVID-19 vaccine days before his heart attack trace back to an article quoting an unnamed family member. NewsGuard said the website in question “frequently publishes unsubstantiated claims based on unclear sourcing.”


The CDC wrote that it found “no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths” after reviewing months of reports to its vaccine safety surveillance program.





See the sources for this fact-check




DMX, the raspy-voiced rapper behind several hip-hop anthems such as ""X Gon Give It to Ya"" and ""Party Up (Up In Here),"" died April 9 at a hospital in New York, where he had been on life support after suffering a heart attack days earlier. The rapper, born Earl Simmons, was 50.
The hospital where DMX died said in a statement that he died ""peacefully with family present after suffering a catastrophic cardiac arrest.""
It is not clear what preceded the rapper’s heart attack. But in the days surrounding DMX’s death, social media users circulated posts suggesting that the rapper died days after getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The implication: the vaccine made his heart fail.
Various social media posts sharing the same headline — ""DMX Received Covid Vaccine Days Before Heart Attack"" — got tens of thousands of interactions on Facebook and Instagram, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.

The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The source of the viral headline was MTO News, a gossip news site. One day before DMX died, the site quoted an unnamed family member as saying that DMX got his COVID-19 shot once he became eligible to receive it ""so that he could go travel and perform, stuff like that.""
PolitiFact could not verify the accuracy of the quotes or whether DMX was recently vaccinated before he died, as the headline claimed. MTO News did not respond to a request for comment, and our inquiries to DMX’s manager also went unanswered.
But Murray Richman, DMX’s longtime attorney, told PolitiFact that the rap icon did not die of COVID-19 or because of a COVID-19 vaccine.
""Earl Simmons did not die of COVID or a COVID vaccine,"" Richman said. ""Earl Simmons died of a heart attack, spurred on by I don’t know what, but certainly not COVID or the vaccine.""

The MTO News article does not provide proof that DMX died because he received the COVID-19 vaccine. The statements from his family and the hospital did not mention a vaccine, and Richman had told several news outlets that he was not sure what caused the heart attack even before the MTO News article published. (He was responding to a tabloid report that said DMX had suffered a drug overdose.)
""You can get a COVID vaccine and still die from something else,"" said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
MTO News ""frequently publishes unsubstantiated claims based on unclear sourcing,"" according to NewsGuard, a service that reviews and rates news and information sites according to nine basic journalistic criteria. NewsGuard identified several articles on MTO News that made false claims about celebrities’ sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as articles that embedded a doctored video about former President Donald Trump’s hair.
In 2020, PolitiFact rated False an MTO News headline attributing a fabricated quote about George Zimmerman to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
The claim about DMX mirrors other social media posts that wrongly blamed COVID-19 vaccines for the deaths of other celebrities, such as baseball legend Hank Aaron. Aaron died after receiving his vaccine, but not because of it, we found. 
The U.S. administered over 167 million COVID-19 vaccine doses between Dec. 14, 2020, and April 5, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC’s vaccine safety surveillance program received 2,794 reports of death, affecting 0.00167% of recipients. 
The agency wrote that after reviewing death certificates as well as autopsy and medical records for those people, it found ""no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.""
Our ruling
Instagram posts claimed, ""DMX received COVID vaccine days before heart attack.""
The rumor can be sourced to a website that purported to quote an unnamed family member. Statements from the rapper’s family and the hospital that kept him on life support after a heart attack did not mention the coronavirus or a COVID-19 vaccine. 
DMX’s attorney told PolitiFact that the rapper did not die because of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Health experts say there is no evidence that injecting ultraviolet light into the body would kill viruses like the novel coronavirus.


There is no scientific evidence to support alternative health treatments like ultraviolet blood irradiation.





See the sources for this fact-check




Health experts have debunked President Donald Trump’s idea to potentially use sunlight to treat coronavirus patients. But some social media users say the president is onto something.
An April 24 Facebook post shows an image of what appears to be someone hooked up to an IV that is emanating blue light. The caption claims it shows a ""UV radiation"" treatment.
""For all you dummies that have absolutely no idea what trump is talking about... INTERNAL DISINFECTANT aka Ultraviolet Radiation is administered into the body as a ‘disinfectant’ to kill bacteria and viruses and this has been used for a while now,"" reads the post. 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
During an April 23 press briefing, Trump floated the idea of using light to treat COVID-19 patients after a Department of Homeland Security official presented a preliminary study that found sunlight kills the coronavirus on certain surfaces. We found no evidence to suggest such a treatment would work on patients, but we wanted to take a closer look at this recent Facebook post.
While the exact origin of the image in the post is unclear, its central claim — that some health care providers inject UV light into patients to kill bacteria and viruses — is inaccurate. We reached out to the original poster for evidence, but we haven’t heard back.
We used a reverse image search to scour the internet for the source of the photo in the Facebook post. While we couldn’t find the source, we did find several tweets from the same day that included the image.
One user who shared the photo claimed it shows ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI). The treatment involves drawing a patient’s blood, then exposing that blood to an external light box before returning it to the body. It was popular in the mid-20th century before the development of antibiotics and was used to treat conditions including pneumonia, tuberculosis, arthritis and asthma..
Now UBI is mainly used in the alternative-medicine community. But UV light is not ""administered"" into patients’ bodies, as the Facebook post claims, and experts who have experimented with the treatment say there is no scientific evidence that it kills bacteria or viruses.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Dr. Edzard Ernst, an emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, said the research into UBI and related methods has been limited in scope.
""Yes, there are quite a few papers on UBI and related methods. But most of them are in-vitro studies, while robust clinical trials are missing completely,"" Ernst wrote in an April 25 blog post. ""Needless to say also that UBI is an invasive treatment where lots of things might go badly wrong.""
RELATED: Why Trump’s comments on using disinfectants, sunlight to treat COVID-19 are wrong
There are three types of UV light: UVA, UVB and UVC. The first makes up the majority of radiation that reaches the Earth, the second can cause sunburn and skin cancer, and the third destroys genetic material.
Applying UVC light to rooms and surfaces has helped some hospitals cut the transmission rate of diseases like MRSA, which can linger in rooms after patients are discharged. The light waves kill bacteria and viruses by disrupting their DNA.
But applying UVC light directly to the body would damage genetic material and cause burns within seconds, experts told PolitiFact. Physicians do sometimes use UVA or UVB light to treat skin lymphoma, but they avoid giving patients too much, as it could increase their chances of developing skin cancer later in life.
""There is a modified version of this in which a drug can be injected ahead of time to increase cell sensitivity to externally applied UV, but in general it’s not possible to inject UV light itself,"" said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, an associate research scientist at Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity, in an email.
Health care providers also sometimes treat donated blood or plasma with radiation before performing infusions to prevent certain diseases, but most American blood banks use gamma rays or x-rays. That’s different from using UV light to treat blood or plasma that’s still inside a patient. 
""There is no evidence that injecting UV light into the body will kill bacteria or viruses,"" said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, a clinical assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University, in an email. ""We irradiate blood that has been taken out of the body, but that is different than using UV light. I am not sure what that picture is in the Facebook post.""

Tweets","Michigan residents can still buy car seats in stores




If Your Time is short



• Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order does not ban the sale of car seats.
• Initial confusion about the order led to some Michigan Walmart stores mistakenly prohibiting the sale of car seats. 
• Walmart said it clarified the policies for store managers in Michigan.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s aggressive steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 in her hard-hit state have earned her a lot of national attention. 
Back home in Michigan, they’re stirring up complaints from conservatives who say the Democratic governor is overstepping her power or banning the sale of things they need.  
On April 15, thousands of people clogged the streets of the state capital, Lansing, in their cars to protest the governor’s latest statewide stay-at-home order, which tightened restrictions on residents and businesses and extended them to April 30. The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition.
The governor is taking flak on social media, too, with critics claiming falsely that her order bans the sale of American flags and bug spray. 
Untrue claims that Whitmer banned the sale of car seats for infants began circulating on social media soon after she issued the order, which required large stores to close off their garden centers and sections selling paint, flooring and furniture, but didn’t affect baby supplies.
An April 10 Twitter post from Tori Sachs, executive director of the conservative group Michigan Rising Action, showed a picture of car seats at a Walmart roped off by yellow caution tape and a sign that said: ""By order of the State of Michigan, items in this ‘non-essential’ area are not available for purchase. Please use Walmart.com for your needs until further notice.""
Sachs said in the tweet accompanying the photo: ""Per order from @GovWhitmer, people in Michigan are now banned from purchasing a new baby car seat in stores. This is dangerous and this order needs clarification immediately.""
The photo was originally shared by a Facebook user before it was tweeted by Sachs.
Another Facebook user posted about a Walmart in Big Rapids, Mich., refusing to sell her a car seat that was in a restricted area on April 10.
Child seats are not in the categories restricted by the order
Fortunately for Michiganders in the market for one, the governor’s executive order did not ban the sale of car seats.
""To be clear, the EO asks stores over 50K square feet to close down sections of their store to protect against unnecessary traffic, like garden centers, furniture, paint, carpet/flooring,"" a Whitmer spokesperson said April 12 in a statement to a local TV channel. ""Child car seats aren't in any of those categories.""
The statement suggests the Michigan stores that instituted temporary bans on the sale of car seats misinterpreted a provision in Executive Order 2020-42 that required large stores to close off areas selling some products.
The executive order says: ""For stores of more than 50,000 square feet: … Close areas of the store — by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means — that are dedicated to the following classes of goods: carpet or flooring; furniture; garden centers or plant nurseries; paint.""
Whitmer tweeted links to a frequently-asked-questions page repeatedly on April 12 in an effort to correct the misunderstandings about the executive order. It says:

Q: Does Executive Order 2020-42 ban the purchasing of car seats for children? 
A: No. Car seats may be available for purchase.
Whitmer also addressed the confusion and misinformation surrounding the order in an April 13 press conference and COVID-19 update.
""First and foremost, I want to be clear: Nothing in the stay-at-home order prohibits people from buying car seats for your children,"" she said. ""There’s no prohibition on that.""
Whitmer encouraged people to be cautious about whether what they see on social media is people sharing facts or just ""political posturing.""
Her office didn’t respond to requests for comment for this article.
Walmart clarifies order for store management
The average Walmart Supercenter is 187,000 square feet, meaning the Michigan Supercenters would need to adhere to the regulations about closing certain sections. But it is unclear why the two Michigan Walmarts cordoned off their car seats.
Could it have been confusion about the term ""nurseries""?
Walmart did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the retail chain has since clarified its policy on the sale of car seats in Michigan.
""Michigan customers are able to purchase baby car seats, baby furniture and other infant products at their local Walmart,"" a Walmart representative told Business Insider in a statement. ""We are reiterating this direction with store management to ensure consistent service to our customers across our Michigan stores. Customers are also welcome to purchase these items from the convenience of their home through Walmart.com.""
Sachs said on April 12 that she meant for her original tweet to raise awareness about the confusion Whitmer’s executive order caused throughout the state.
""My intention was for the order to be clarified so this didn't happen to another mom,"" Sachs said in a tweet. She added that after her tweet received media coverage and caught the attention of prominent public figures, Whitmer ""finally clarified.""
Our ruling
Sachs tweeted: ""Per order from @GovWhitmer, people in Michigan are now banned from purchasing a new baby car seat in stores.""
No part of the executive order bans the sale of car seats, but large stores are under orders to keep customers away from areas selling items in categories such as gardening, flooring and furniture. Two Michigan Walmarts cited the order in initially roping off and prohibiting the sale of car seats, but Walmart clarified for store managers that baby products can be sold in stores or online.
Whitmer has repeatedly stated that the sale of car seats is not banned in Michigan.

Donald Trump","Trump wrongly claims Biden wants to prosecute churchgoers




If Your Time is short





We found no statements from Joe Biden or other leading Democrats suggesting that they want to prosecute churchgoers, but not people who set churches on fire.


Biden and other Democrats have spoken out against the violence and destruction that took place at some Black Lives Matter protests.





See the sources for this fact-check




At a Tulsa, Okla., rally on June 20, President Donald Trump said that presumptive Democratic rival Joe Biden posed a threat to the rights of churchgoers.
""Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church,"" he said.
Those claims do not align with statements from Biden or other leading Democrats. 
PolitiFact reached out to Trump’s campaign for comment, but got no response. 
How large-gathering rules affect churches
In efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the spring, Democratic and Republican governors across the country imposed stay-at-home orders and limits on large gatherings, which in some cases restricted the number of people allowed to assemble at churches and other venues.
States are now in varying stages of reopening and loosening limits on public gatherings, though some are still requiring or recommending social-distancing practices.
Some church leaders have tried to defy states’ social-distancing rules, and lawsuits claiming that these regulations threaten First Amendment rights have been filed in states including California, Louisiana and Virginia. 
Such cases have pitted protections for religious freedom against public health concerns. In a 5-4 decision in May, the Supreme Court rejected a California church’s challenge to state rules restricting the number of people who can attend services.
Prosecuting churchgoers
The first part of Trump’s claim, that ""Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church,"" is not consistent with Biden’s statements.
In a speech in Darby, Pa., on June 17, Biden spoke broadly about the dangers of large gatherings and criticized Trump for not taking the coronavirus pandemic seriously enough. 
""He’s so eager to get back on his campaign, to his campaign rallies, that he’ll put people at risk as everyone’s pointed out, in violation of the CDC guidelines that still warn against large gatherings,"" Biden said.
But Biden hasn’t said that churchgoers should be prosecuted.
A Pew Research Center study of executive orders in effect on April 24 found that only 10 states prohibited in-person religious gatherings through extensive social-distancing regulations. Three of those states have Republican governors, and six have Democratic governors (Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party).

By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







In Florida, religious service gatherings were exempted from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect in April. The order came after a pastor of a Tampa church was arrested for holding services that defied Hillsborough County public health orders. Prosecutors later dropped the misdemeanor charges against the pastor, citing his cooperation with social-distancing rules.
We couldn’t find examples of Biden or any other leading Democrats saying they wanted to prosecute churchgoers for disobeying social distancing guidelines.
Burning churches
The second part of Trump’s statement claims that Biden and other Democrats don’t want to see people prosecuted for burning churches.
During demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality on the night of May 31, a fire was set in the basement nursery of St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is near the White House. Earlier that day, Biden condemned the violence occurring at some Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response,"" Biden wrote in a statement on Medium. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.""
In a May appearance on ABC News' ""This Week,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there is room for peaceful protest in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
""I do think that there’s a place for protest at the sign of a knee going into the neck of a person who’s not offering resistance,"" Pelosi said. ""When you have a crowd, you will have those who will disrupt, and that is most unfortunate.""
Democratic mayors, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, have also condemned destruction that’s taken place at some demonstrations.
""When you burn down this city, you’re burning down our community,"" Bottoms said in May after people set cars on fire during protests.
Our ruling
Trump said that Biden and other Democrats were in favor of prosecuting churchgoers, but didn’t want to prosecute people for burning churches. 
We didn’t find any leading Democrats who said they wanted to prosecute churchgoers for disobeying social distancing rules. 
We also didn’t find statements from Biden or other leading Democrats that people who set fires at churches shouldn’t be prosecuted.
In fact, Biden and other leading Democrats spoke out against violence and burnings that took place at some Black Lives Matter demonstrations.

Instagram posts","Claim about 920 miscarriages caused by COVID-19 vaccination lacks evidence




If Your Time is short





The post does not provide evidence supporting its claim, and we found none confirming that COVID-19 vaccines have caused hundreds of miscarriages.


Public health experts generally recommend that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people who are pregnant.





See the sources for this fact-check




There’s still a lot to learn about COVID-19 and the vaccines created to protect people from catching and spreading the virus. But based on what’s known about how the vaccines work and available data, health care experts believe it’s generally safe for someone to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if they are pregnant.
Despite that, a screenshot of a headline posted on Instagram makes this claim: ""920 women lose their unborn babies after getting vaccinated."" The caption for the photo says ""this data is from the U.K."" It also references the United States, adding that there have been ""571 miscarriages following the Covid vax that have been reported in the U.S. The info is very easy to access and is confirmed by the CDC since the CDC uses VAERS data.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)
We found the article that goes with that headline on a website called The True Defender. The story does not offer support for 920 miscarriages or repeat the number.
The article claims that statistics from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database, called VAERS, shows ""395 women have reported losing their unborn child as a result of Covid vaccinations.""
VAERS is a tool that can be used by anyone to report any reactions and adverse events experienced after any vaccination. But the fact alone that something was submitted to the database does not prove that the reaction or event happened as a direct result of vaccination. (Years ago, someone testing the system entered a report claiming that an influenza vaccine turned him into The Hulk.)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the federal agencies that oversees VAERS, told PolitiFact that as of May 28, there had been 439 reports of miscarriages among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.
""However, these are not confirmed cases,"" said Benjamin Haynes, a CDC spokesperson. ""VAERS is not designed to determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event. While some reported adverse events may be caused by vaccination, others are not and may have occurred coincidentally. Each of these are investigated with local health officials.""
A spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which also oversees VAERS, told PolitiFact that VAERS has ""received reports of spontaneous abortions after COVID-19 vaccination. However, a review of available clinical information does not establish a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.""
The VAERS website also cautions that the reports in its database ""may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. In large part, reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind.""

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







PolitiFact has reported that VAERS has been useful for health agencies and researchers to collect and analyze data on vaccine after-effects and to detect patterns that may warrant a closer look. But given the database’s open-access system, allowing reports to be entered before they are verified, some have mischaracterized the data or taken it out of context. (We have fact-checked similar claims about deaths following vaccines.)
For this fact-check, we also reached out to the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for more information. We did not hear back in time for publication. But the agency in April told PolitiFact that ""there is currently no pattern to suggest an elevated risk of miscarriage related to exposure to the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy.""
Miscarriage is estimated to happen in about 1 in 4 pregnancies in the U.K. (outside of the pandemic) and most occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, so some miscarriages would be expected to occur following vaccination purely by chance, the agency said. The agency also said that it was closely monitoring a small number of reports of miscarriage following vaccination in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Studies in animals receiving a COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies, the CDC said.
Clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy are underway or planned, the CDC said. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and analyzing data from people who participated in the completed clinical trials, received the vaccine and became pregnant.
The CDC has more details about the safety of vaccines for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Our ruling
A headline in an Instagram post said: ""920 women lose their unborn babies after getting vaccinated.""
We did not find evidence confirming that COVID-19 vaccines directly caused hundreds of miscarriages.
A U.S. database aiming to monitor vaccine side effects has recorded more than 400 reports of miscarriages following a COVID-19 injection. But agencies overseeing the database say that the number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of potential problems associated with vaccines.
Public health experts say that there is limited data about the effect of vaccines on pregnancy. But the research so far indicates they are safe and effective.

WorldNetDaily","No, Dr. Anthony Fauci did not fund research tied to COVID-19 ‘creation’




If Your Time is short



• There is no evidence that the coronavirus was made in a lab. The overwhelming consensus among public health experts is that the virus evolved naturally.



See the sources for this fact-check




Editor’s note, May 17, 2021: When this fact-check was first published in February 2021, PolitiFact’s sources included researchers who asserted the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have been manipulated. That assertion is now more widely disputed. Read our May 2021 report for more on the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. That dispute notwithstanding, the claim that COVID-19 was created with research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci remains False.
More than a year after the coronavirus first arrived in the U.S., conspiracy theories continue to spread about a virology lab in Wuhan, China, which has drawn scrutiny throughout the pandemic for research it conducted on bat viruses. 
One new claim about the lab comes from conservative news site WorldNetDaily, which tried to connect Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, to the origin of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. 
""New evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci,"" reads the headline.
Despite its promise of ""new evidence,"" the WorldNetDaily article largely resembled other conspiracy theories that we have fact-checked in the past. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
As evidence of its claims, the article cited an investigation by Fox News commentator Steve Hilton, who claims that the coronavirus was created at the Wuhan lab with NIH grant money. 
Although the NIH did fund a project at the Wuhan lab, there’s no proof that the coronavirus was bioengineered. Both the WorldNetDaily article and Hilton’s segment rely on a series of unsubstantiated allegations to spin a conspiracy theory about the virus being a lab creation.
WorldNetDaily has since dialed back on many of its claims, issuing three separate corrections, all of which cite scientists pushing back on the notion that SARS-CoV-2 was manmade. It has also placed a question mark at the end of the original headline. However, the bulk of the article text has not been updated.
The NIH grant to EcoHealth Alliance
In 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the part of the NIH headed by Fauci, awarded a $3.4 million grant to the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to protect people from viruses that jump from species to species. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including Thailand, Vietnam and China. 
The group hired the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct genetic analyses of bat coronaviruses collected in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest of Wuhan. EcoHealth Alliance paid the lab $598,500 over five years. The lab had secured approval from both the U.S. State Department and the NIH. 
That the NIAID funded the project is not in question. However, the WorldNetDaily article goes further than that, claiming that the grant covered ""gain of function"" research on a bat coronavirus, which ""created"" SARS-CoV-2. 
Gain-of-function research is a controversial form of study that involves boosting the infectivity and lethality of a pathogen. Proponents of gain-of-function say it helps researchers spot potential threats to human health and allows them to figure out ways to tackle a new virus. Fauci has advocated for gain-of-function research in the past. In a 2011 article he co-wrote for the Washington Post, he promoted it as a means to study influenza viruses. 
However, there’s no hard proof to support the article’s claims about gain-of-function research. The overwhelming consensus among public health experts is that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 evolved naturally. 
All parties involved in the grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have denied that it involved gain-of-function research.

""We have not ever participated in gain-of-function research. Nor have we ever been funded to participate in gain-of-function research,"" Robert Kessler with the EcoHealth Alliance told PolitiFact last May. 
The NIH told us: ""The research supported under the grant to EcoHealth Alliance Inc. characterized the function of newly discovered bat spike proteins and naturally occurring pathogens and did not involve the enhancement of the pathogenicity or transmissibility of the viruses studied."" 
The grant was approved in May 2014. Five months later, on Oct. 17, the Obama administration announced it would not fund new projects that involved gain-of-function research, citing safety and security risks. 
The NIH told us that it reviewed the EcoHealth Alliance project after the funding pause and determined that it did not involve gain-of-function research. As a result, it was not affected by the White House’s new policy.
Hilton and WorldNetDaily do not provide evidence that the grant covered gain-of-function research. When we reached out to Fox News, a spokesperson pointed us to the transcript of Hilton’s segment. Art Moore, the author of the WorldNetDaily article, did not respond to a request for comment. 
MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt reviewed a paper that appears to have been published with financial assistance from the grant. According to Esvelt, certain techniques that the researchers used seemed to meet the definition of gain-of-function research. But he told PolitiFact that ""the work reported in this specific paper definitely did NOT lead to the creation of SARS-CoV-2"" because the genetic sequences of the virus studied in the paper differ from that of the new coronavirus. 
No evidence that the coronavirus was manmade
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and the NIH have all said that the virus was not derived from a lab. 
If the virus had been altered in a lab, its genomic data would show signs of tampering. Although scientists from around the world have publicly shared the virus’ genetic makeup thousands of times, there’s still no evidence that the virus was bioengineered. 
On Feb. 19, 2020, public health experts signed a public statement to ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.""
""Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes"" of SARS-CoV-2 ""and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,"" the statement reads, citing nine scientific studies. 
A detailed computational analysis of the coronavirus conducted by five researchers in March found that its genetic makeup showed no signs of alteration. The ability of the virus to bind to human cells is most likely the result of natural selection in an animal host or in humans after the virus jumped from animals. 
""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" the researchers wrote.
There are unresolved concerns that a protective lapse at the lab could have allowed a natural virus to escape, but there is no hard proof of such a lapse. 
Our ruling
WorldNetDaily wrote that ""New evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci.""
Both the NIH and EcoHealth Alliance have denied that a grant to the Wuhan lab funded gain-of-function research, though a scientist told us that one paper published with assistance from the grant seems to describe techniques similar to gain-of-function. 
The CDC, the WHO, and the NIH have all said that the virus that causes COVID-19 evolved naturally. There is no evidence to support that claim that it was created by researchers.

Van Wanggaard","No, order doesn’t require masks in your house or walking your dog




If Your Time is short





State mask order applies to public spaces, both indoors and confined outdoor spaces.


The order specifically exempts private residences.


And masks are not required — though they are “strongly recommended” — in general outdoor areas where one would walk a dog.





See the sources for this fact-check




In a state Capitol where the response to COVID-19 — and pretty much everything else — splits along party lines, the response to Gov. Tony Evers’ July 30, 2020, statewide mask order was predictable.
Republican lawmakers launched a flurry of news releases condemning the Democratic governor’s decision, although more than 30 states now require masks in some public spaces. Republicans successfully sued Evers in March over his stay-at-home order.
In a July 30, 2020 news release titled ""Statement on statewide mask mandate,"" state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, said mask decisions should be made by businesses and individuals, not governments.
""I can understand why some businesses are requiring masks. That is their choice, just as it is my choice to do business elsewhere. That’s what America is about,"" he wrote. ""But no one is going to make me wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog. That is also what America is about – free choice.""
Given the context, Wanggaard is suggesting the governor’s mandate requires masks while walking a dog or in one’s house.
Just one problem.
Evers’ order does neither of those.
What the order says
The July 30, 2020, mask order generally requires all Wisconsin residents to wear face coverings in public spaces indoors starting Aug. 1, through the end of September.
The order lays out numerous exceptions, including children under age 5, people who are eating or sleeping, individual speakers making a presentation for an audience and people who are unable to wear a mask due to a medical condition. Violating the order could result in fines of up to $200.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The core of the mandate is worded like this:
Every individual, age five and older, in Wisconsin shall wear a face covering if both of the following apply:
a. The individual is indoors or in an enclosed space, other than at a private residence; and;
b. Another person or persons who are not members of individual's household or living unit are present in the same room or enclosed space.
Face coverings are strongly recommended in all other settings, including outdoors when it is not possible to maintain physical distancing.
The order earlier defines an ""enclosed space"" as a place open to the public, including outdoor bars, restaurants and park structures.
Nothing there lines up with Wanggaard’s declaration about masks at home or walking his dog. The order explicitly refers only to indoor or enclosed spaces and notes private homes as an exception.
Asked for evidence of Wanggaard’s claim, staffer Scott Kelly noted the City of Racine’s order would apply while walking a dog. It requires coverings within six feet of a non-family member in any outdoor space.
But the news release was focused on the statewide order, not local ones.
Our ruling
Wanggaard said he opposes statewide mask order because it would require him to ""wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog.""
But an open outdoor area where a person would walk a dog isn’t within the requirements of the mandate, and the order has a specific exemption for private homes.

Facebook posts","A 2010 Rockefeller Foundation report does not show that the COVID-19 was planned




If Your Time is short





The report, which explored “the role of technology and the future of globalization,” presented four possible future scenarios of how the world might evolve, including one in which an influenza pandemic and lockdowns occurred.


The scenarios were hypothetical. They weren’t predictions or plans.





See the sources for this fact-check




A Facebook post claims that a 2010 report by the Rockefeller Foundation shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and the international response, with lockdowns and other restrictions, were ""meticulously planned"" at least a decade before they occurred. 
The post includes video from a far-right legislator in the Netherlands reading from the report and drawing connections to the pandemic. 
""The house of cards is collapsing,"" the caption on the post says. ""This Dutch politician reads excerpts from the 2010 Rockefeller report and shows us clearly that this entire shit-show was meticulously planned AT LEAST 10 years ago. So what now? Are the tell-a-vision worshippers going to stick to the media drip-fed lies purely out of pride and ego? Is it too late now that so many are playing Russian Roulette by taking the mystery shot?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post mischaracterizes the content of the Rockefeller report.
The report from the New York-based philanthropy, ""Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development,"" was not a plan for creating the COVID-19 pandemic. It envisioned four ways in which the world might evolve, including one that involved an influenza pandemic and tighter government controls in response to it. 
The foundation’s president wrote that the foundation uses scenario planning, ""a process of creating narratives about the future based on factors likely to affect a particular set of challenges and opportunities,"" for use in philanthropy to ""identify unique interventions, simulate and rehearse important decisions that could have profound implications, and highlight previously undiscovered areas of connection and intersection."" Foundation staff and others worked with the Global Business Network consulting firm, which does scenario planning, according to the report.
The video
The video shows remarks by Thierry Baudet, a member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands and leader of the far-right Forum for Democracy party. 
In March, Twitter marked as misleading a tweet in which Baudet said he would not receive a COVID-19 vaccination, that the virus risk to him ""is completely negligible"" and the vaccine’s side effects ""severe."" 
In the five-minute video, posted June 4, Baudet reads excerpts from the report, drawing connections to the COVID-19 pandemic. He closed his remarks by saying ""that the locking down of the entire country, half the world for 1.5 years because of a flu variety is insane…. This COVID phase has been a practice to train obedience."" 
What the report says
The 54-page report explores ""the role of technology and the future of globalization,"" and considers ""the multiple, divergent ways in which our world could evolve"" in four possible scenarios:
""LOCK STEP: A world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback.

""CLEVER TOGETHER: A world in which highly coordinated and successful strategies emerge for addressing both urgent and entrenched worldwide issues.
""HACK ATTACK: An economically unstable and shock-prone world in which governments weaken, criminals thrive and dangerous innovations emerge.
""SMART SCRAMBLE: An economically depressed world in which individuals and communities develop localized, makeshift solutions to a growing set of problems.""
The scenarios, the report’s introduction says, ""are not predictions. Rather they are thoughtful hypotheses that allow us to imagine, and then to rehearse, different strategies for how to be more prepared for the future.""
The ""Lock Step"" scenario, which is what Baudet read from, goes like this:
In 2012, a pandemic of a new influenza originating from wild geese infected nearly 20% of the global population and killed 8 million in seven months, most of them healthy young adults. Economies were devastated. China fared better than the United States and other nations by imposing a quarantine on all citizens and sealing all borders. 
Countries imposed measures such as mask requirements and, ""even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified,"" with developing countries ordering biometric IDs for all citizens. 
""Virulent nationalism created new hazards: spectators at the 2018 World Cup, for example, wore bulletproof vests that sported a patch of their national flag."" 
In the developed world, ""scientists and innovators were often told by governments what research lines to pursue and were guided mostly toward projects that would make money."" 
By 2025, ""people seemed to be growing weary of so much top-down control,"" and ""disaffected youth and people who had seen their status and opportunities slip away — largely in developing countries — incited civil unrest.""
The report indicates that some of the events of the past year may have been conceivable or predictable a decade ago, but not that they were ""meticulously planned.""

A widely shared Facebook post says a 2010 Rockefeller Foundation report shows the COVID-19 pandemic and the international response were ""meticulously planned at least 10 years ago.""

Laura Ingraham","Laura Ingraham wrong about 'no real scientific basis' for social distancing




If Your Time is short





Experts in public health and epidemiology said Ingraham’s claim is wrong. There’s plenty of science behind social distancing.


Two influential 2007 studies looked at the 1918 influenza pandemic and found that places with layered and sustained social distancing policies were generally better off.


The coronavirus is believed to spread mainly among people in close contact.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News host Laura Ingraham falsely claimed on her TV show that there’s ""no real scientific basis"" behind social distancing, the practice of keeping distance from others to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.
""Although intuitively I think it probably seemed like social distancing would be necessary, there was no real scientific basis for believing that, since it had never been studied,"" Ingraham said.

Americans have widely followed social distancing directives to ""flatten the curve"" of new coronavirus cases and prevent hospitals from being stretched beyond capacity. In the absence of widespread testing, most Americans have supported such mitigation efforts. 
But scattered protests have also captured attention and led pundits like Ingraham and fellow Fox News host Tucker Carlson to call for an end to more statewide shutdowns as U.S. deaths due to the coronavirus top 70,000.
Members of the White House coronavirus task force have encouraged social distancing. President Donald Trump credited nationwide closures with saving ""millions of lives"" as recently as May 3 in a town hall.
But while it’s difficult to assess the exact impact of social distancing policies so far, experts told us Ingraham’s claim is wrong. There’s plenty of science behind social distancing.
""It’s one of the few tools that we know works in the case of an unknown, novel virus such as this,"" said Thomas Novotny, an epidemiologist at San Diego State University.
Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.
Studies of the 1918 influenza are informative
With the coronavirus still running its course, studies on the impact of mitigation efforts are only just emerging. But past respiratory disease outbreaks have been informative, experts said.
On her show, Ingraham cited a recent study on the effects of lockdowns in western Europe and a clip of Stanford University biologist Michael Levitt calling European lockdowns a ""mistake.""
She also highlighted a recent CBS News interview in which Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said mitigation ""didn’t work as well as we expected.""
Gottlieb has himself encouraged social distancing, however. And the study of European countries, which hasn’t yet been peer reviewed, doesn’t say social distancing is futile, but rather that social distancing measures ""have approximately the same effects"" as full lockdowns.
""My work does not question the efficiency of social distancing,"" said Thomas Meunier, the researcher behind the study. 
Charles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University, said social distancing ""is a fundamental way to interrupt the transmission of disease in populations.""
""To say that there was no scientific basis for believing that is like saying there is no scientific basis for epidemiology,"" he said.

The COVID-19 vaccines make people ""magnetized. They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick.""












By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







The concept of limiting person-to-person contact dates back centuries. But non-pharmaceutical interventions, as the practices we associate with social distancing are known, became official U.S. policy under President George W. Bush in 2007, according to the New York Times.
The shift came after researchers looked back at government responses to the 1918 influenza, which killed about 675,000 Americans. Elaine Nsoesie, assistant professor of global health at Boston University, said that pandemic saw many social distancing measures put in place, including bans on gatherings and school closures.
RELATED: What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing
One study in the Journal of the American Medical Association examined social distancing in 43 cities for about 24 weeks in 1918 and 1919. It found cities suffered less when they implemented social distancing swiftly, comprehensively and for a sustained period of time.
A second study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on 17 U.S. cities. It found those with early, layered interventions had flatter epidemic curves and peak death rates about 50% lower than cities that didn’t take similar steps.
Those findings became the basis for the policies adopted by the Bush administration and later modified under President Barack Obama.
Studies of the 1918 pandemic ""indicated that early implementation of multiple social distancing interventions was associated with a lower death rate at the peak of the epidemic,"" Nsoesie said.
David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, told us Ingraham’s claim is incorrect: ""Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been shown to help reduce the overall number of cases and virus-related mortality."" 
That’s because shrinking gatherings ""should lead to less exposure to potentially infected individuals and thus reduce the potential for transmission,"" Hamer said.
Other evaluations of social distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing and related interventions have been compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially as they relate to influenza pandemics. (See page 23 of this 2017 CDC document, for example.)
Now more than ever, it’s important to sort fact from fiction. Please donate to support our mission.
Social distancing and COVID-19
What we know about COVID-19 also suggests that social distancing works, experts said.
Hamer cited the Imperial College of London's projection that the U.S. could see up to 2.2 million COVID-19 deaths if it did nothing to slow the spread, as well as a not-yet-peer-reviewed study from Swiss researchers that estimated the impact of various interventions on new cases.
The Swiss researchers said non-pharmaceutical interventions contributed to ""a strong overall reduction"" in new cases, with venue closures, border closures, work-from-home policies and limits on large gatherings having the highest impact.
The coronavirus spreads mainly among people in close contact, through respiratory droplets launched into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, according to the CDC.
""Those droplets, as they’re falling out of the air, someone else may inhale them or get them into their mouth or their eyes,"" said Johns Hopkins University’s Lauren Sauer on a university podcast. ""And that’s why you have to be less than 6 feet away to really be at risk.""
Our ruling
Ingraham said ""there was no real scientific basis for believing that"" social distancing would be necessary, ""since it had never been studied.""
Experts we spoke to cited a number of studies — including two influential analyses of the 1918 influenza — that show social distancing can help slow the spread of new infectious diseases.

Dan Forest","NC Republican wrongfully says masks 'do not work'




If Your Time is short




North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who’s running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, said scientific evidence shows masks ""do not work with viruses.""
Masks don't guarantee protection from the virus. But that's beside the point, since no experts are arguing that.
Multiple studies published this year show that mask-wearing on a broad scale can reduce the spread of COVID-19, a fact that's been emphasized by the news media, the CDC and Trump advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci.




See the sources for this fact-check




At a campaign event in western North Carolina on July 4, the state’s Republican candidate for governor dismissed the need for face coverings during the coronavirus pandemic.
Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who’s running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, said scientific evidence doesn’t support mask mandates.
""There have been multiple comprehensive studies at the deepest level held to scientific standards in controlled environments that have all said for decades, masks do not work with viruses,"" he told a reporter for The Hendersonville Times-News.
Is it true that studies ""all said"" that masks ""do not work on viruses?""
Forest’s statement that they ""do not work"" ignores recent studies -- and federal healthcare guidance -- showing that mask-wearing does reduce the spread of coronavirus.
What Forest said
While virologist and Trump advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and other experts have said masks alone don’t guarantee protection from the virus, they do believe masks can help slow down the spread of COVID-19.
But, by saying ""all"" studies show no use for masks, Forest left himself no margin for error. So we asked the Forest campaign to cite Forest’s sources.
Campaign spokesman Andrew Dunn noted an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 1 titled, ""Universal masking in hospitals in the Covid-19 era.""
Dunn quoted a line from the authors’ opening statement, which reads:
""We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."" Authors go on to say the purpose of their article is to examine ""whether a mask offers any further protection in health care settings in which the wearer has no direct interactions with symptomatic patients.""
Authors later noticed that people were quoting their article to discourage mask-wearing, so they released a follow-up letter to clarify their position. 
""We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less,"" researchers wrote in a June 1 letter.
They acknowledged writing the sentence that Dunn cited, then said: ""but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments. A growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact.""
Dunn also cited a study, published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine in 2015, that examined the use of ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" to reduce the spread of the flu.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions are public health strategies used to reduce virus transmissions. These interventions include home quarantine for infected persons, social distancing, reduction in public gatherings, and masks.

Dunn pointed out that researchers wrote that there are ""widely disparate findings on masks' effectiveness in combating viruses."" The study examined existing reports on NPIs, but found that many of the reports were flawed.
Researchers reviewed 100 studies on intervention strategies and found inconclusive results for most of them, including masks. Of those 100 studies, researchers wrote that ""only seven met all selection criteria and pooled analysis was not feasible"" because they had ""significant design flaws.""
Researchers wrote:
""Reduction of viral transmission by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) has a significant appeal and is often recommended. However, the efficacy of such interventions is unclear … Despite the potential for NPI in preventing influenza transmission, there is very limited data available. … Properly designed studies evaluating large populations including ‘at risk’ patients and in a variety of communities are needed.""
That was 2015. Now fast forward to the emergence of COVID-19.
Other studies
Researchers have launched multiple studies on potential methods for stifling the outbreak, finding that masks could help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Back in April, researchers wrote in the U.S. National Library of Medicine that ""to date, no study has been done to examine the effectiveness of masks against the SARS‐CoV‐2 causing COVID‐19. However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets.""
A study published in The Royal Society on June 10 found ""the results of two mathematical models and show that facemask use by the public could make a major contribution to reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.""
Another study, published in The Lancet medical journal on June 1, found that ""face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection.""
Another study, coming out in the August edition of the International Journal of Nursing Studies, concluded that ""community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic.""
Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health, noted that a study out of Germany found that a mask mandate decreased the COVID-19 growth rate by about 40%.
When it comes to mask-wearing, Graham said: ""It’s not that there’s no transmission, it’s that there’s less.""
The CDC, which earlier this year said masks weren’t necessary in public places, changed its guidance on April 3 after studies found that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals. Now, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering saying they ""help protect people around you"" and are ""most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings."" 
PolitiFact has reported on the effectiveness of masks on several occasions, quoting experts who say coverings, when worn properly, can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 when combined with other prevention methods such as frequent hand washing and social distancing.
Our ruling
Forest said ""there have been multiple comprehensive studies at the deepest level held to scientific standards in controlled environments that have all said for decades, masks do not work with viruses.""
His statement overlooks recent data, news stories, CDC guidance and the advice of one of President Trump’s top pandemic advisors. While face coverings alone can’t guarantee protection from a virus, recent studies show they do reduce the risk of spreading the virus.
And that’s the goal in this pandemic: to stop the spread. So Forest’s claim that masks ""do not work"" is inaccurate.

Facebook posts","States do use masks to contain COVID-19 in prisons




If Your Time is short





Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus.


Despite a claim on Facebook, New York, Michigan and California prisons all are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response.


Certain groups of inmates are being freed early as a way to try to limit the spread of COVID-19. They include pregnant women with less than six months left on sentences for nonviolent offenses, and other inmates who are either over 60 with health issues or months away from being eligible for parole.





See the sources for this fact-check




Health officials and governors in states hit hard by COVID-19 are recommending masks to help contain the spread of the virus.
But if masks really work, a Facebook post asks rhetorically, why aren’t governors using them more in jails and prisons that have become COVID-19 hotspots? 
The post — accompanying images of governors Mario Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California — claims the three Democrats have ""released thousands of dangerous prisoners into the public to kill innocent people and cause stress to our citizens,"" and that the governors ""make"" citizens wear masks. 
""If the masks actually work to prevent COVID-19,"" the post continues, ""then why didn’t we just hand them out to all inmates … instead of releasing them to prevent the spread?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It is inaccurate on several fronts. Medical experts now agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the states cited in the post have distributed masks to inmates. 
Meanwhile, states that are releasing inmates are considering the potential danger to the public in deciding which ones to release.
Claim overstates prison releases
Across the nation in response to the coronavirus, many more inmates are being released from local jails — which hold people charged with crimes or convicted of low-level crimes — than from prisons, which mostly hold people convicted of felonies. That’s according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, and the New York Times. (In Florida, an inmate released from the Hillsborough County jail, where he was being held on nonviolent drug charges, was charged with second-degree murder the next day.) 
Some are being released from prisons. In New York, Michigan and California, thousands of prison inmates have been released in response to the coronavirus. The Facebook claim goes too far in characterizing them all as posing a threat to kill.
In New York, Cuomo announced in April that pregnant women with less than six months remaining on their sentences for nonviolent offenses would be released from prison. The state announced in March that up to 1,100 inmates being held in local jails for low-level parole violations and deemed not a danger to the public would be released to stem the flow of coronavirus cases in the correctional system. 
Michigan is releasing 200 prison inmates per week because of the coronavirus, WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Mich., reported on April 14. The state is looking to first release inmates eligible for parole who are nonviolent offenders older than 60 with health issues, though no offenses are off-limits, the report said. 
California announced in March that it planned to release as many as 3,500 prison inmates by expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with 60 days or less left on their sentences.
Why COVID-19 spreads in prisons
Correctional and detention facilities pose ""unique challenges"" in combating COVID-19, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. 
Inmates live, work and eat in close settings, heightening the potential for the virus to spread. The virus can be brought into the facility in many ways, including through staff, medical professionals or others who enter from the outside. And options for isolating inmates are limited, the CDC notes.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Across the country, more than 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 of them have died, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that reports on criminal justice.
Staff and inmates are required to wear masks amid large outbreaks:
New York: More than 1,200 prison staff have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the state. The Department of Corrections requires all staff to wear face masks while on duty and supplies all inmates with surgical-type masks.
Michigan: There are more than 2,100 COVID-19 infections among prisoners and Michigan ranks third for the number of prisoner cases, according to the Marshall Project. Each prison employee and inmate has received three masks that can be laundered and worn again, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections. Staff are expected to wear a mask during their entire shift, and prisoners are expected to wear masks except while eating, sleeping or showering.
California: More than 430 cases of COVID-19, including five deaths, have been confirmed at the California Institution for Men in Chino, with tents being set up to provide more space and treatment for inmates, the Sacramento Bee reported. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it provides masks and hand sanitizer to all staff and prisoners.
The effectiveness of masks
While masks alone cannot stop the spread of the coronavirus, health officials agree that facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, help slow the spread of the virus, as we’ve reported. 
The CDC recommends that nearly everyone wear a facial covering while out in public and in areas where social distancing isn’t possible. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snugly and are made of multiple layers.
New research since the start of the coronavirus outbreak supports the use of masks.
For correctional facilities, a May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with physical distancing, movement restrictions and other measures. 
""Prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and consistent application of prevention measures are critical to protecting incarcerated and detained persons, correctional and detention facility staff members, and the communities to which they return,"" the report said.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them.
Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus. New York, Michigan and California prisons are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response. 
Inmates in those states are being freed early as a way to try to limit the spread of COVID-19 — mostly nonviolent offenders or those who aren’t seen as a safety threat.

Jim Steineke","Steineke’s actions, words don’t match on COVID-19 bill




If Your Time is short




Steineke puts forth the Assembly action as the result of compromise, but it simply isn't.

 
The Republican-run state Senate reached a deal with the Democratic governor, but the Assembly set that aside and passed its own bill. The Assembly bill did not involve the governor. And it was immediately criticized by the head of the state Senate.

 
Wisconsin still hasn't passed a COVID-19 bill since April 2020, making it one of the least active legislatures in the country in addressing the pandemic.




See the sources for this fact-check




After going through the last eight months of 2020 without passing a single bill, Wisconsin’s Republican-led Legislature is taking another run at addressing the coronavirus pandemic.
The Legislature was at odds with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers throughout the past year, and rebuffed numerous attempts by Evers to force them into session. 
But the state Senate signaled a potential move toward the middle when it passed a coronavirus relief package Jan. 12, 2021, that had been negotiated with Evers.
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said that bill ""addresses the critically-important needs of school districts, non-profit organizations, and small employers."" Evers called that bill — an amended version of an Assembly bill — ""a good faith effort in compromise and bipartisanship"" and urged the Assembly to pass it as amended and send it to his desk for a signature.
Instead, the Assembly added back in many of the elements the Senate had removed, passing their own version on Jan. 26. This new version now goes back to the Senate, which must decide whether it’s close enough to their version to approve.
If approved, Evers would have to decide whether he is comfortable signing it as well.
Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, touted the bill this way on Twitter:
""Here in Madison, you learn quickly that give and take is needed to get things done,"" Steineke said. ""Assembly Republicans have come to the table and made concessions to get this much-needed relief to hard-working Wisconsin families.""
This paints a picture of a back-and-forth where Assembly Republicans worked with the other side to reach a consensus. Is that really what happened?
Let’s take a closer look at how Steineke’s words and actions line up.
Actions speak louder
We’re coming out of a year in which the Wisconsin Legislature did less than almost any other state legislative body to address the ongoing pandemic, even though it is one of just 10 full-time legislatures in the nation.

“Before the pandemic, just over 40,000 were on continuing UI claims. Now, there are well over 100,000 on state or federal UI benefits.”












By D.L. Davis • June 18, 2021







The Legislature has passed no bills on the topic since mid-April, when both bodies passed wide-ranging legislation addressing unemployment, health care, education and government procedures, many of which applied only during the first public health emergency that Evers declared in March.
The state Senate moved to block this partisan logjam in negotiating with Evers — a step that was rarely taken between the legislative and executive branches in 2020 — by producing the compromise bill. The Republican-run Senate passed the bill 29-2, and Evers promised to sign it.
The Assembly, which had expected the Senate to pass its original version, balked at the changes. Their updated version doesn’t restore all the elements of the original, but it does add back in elements the Senate removed amid its negotiations with Evers. 
In short, the Assembly rejected the Senate’s bipartisan deal that Evers would have signed in favor of its own version that ""fights for the conservative ideals we know are important to our constituents throughout the state,"" as Steineke phrased it in another tweet.
Alesha Emmert, a spokeswoman for Steineke, said Jan. 26 the ""give and take"" he referenced was with his own party. She said Republican leaders of the Assembly and Senate ""discussed amendment language ahead of today’s floor period to see if common ground could be achieved.""
But LeMahieu, the Senate leader, disputed that characterization.
""We are concerned that the changes that the Assembly made will cause the governor to veto the bill, and all along we wanted to make sure that we produced a bill that the governor could sign and would address the needs of Wisconsin,"" LeMahieu told WisPolitics.com after the Assembly vote.
And Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Gov. Tony Evers, said the Assembly didn’t work with Evers on their new version of the coronavirus bill.
Our ruling
After the Assembly ignored a Senate-backed compromise to pass its own coronavirus bill, Steineke said, ""Here in Madison, you learn quickly that give and take is needed to get things done,"" claiming Assembly Republicans had ""come to the table"" and compromised.
This characterization of the Assembly action is disingenuous at best.
Steineke’s verbiage referencing compromise — typically used to refer to politicians from opposing parties finding a middle ground — doesn’t reference bipartisanship at all. Evers wasn’t part of this process. And whatever negotiations occurred between the GOP leaders of the Senate and Assembly, this description clearly overreaches given LeMahieu’s immediate criticism of the result.
That’s not getting things done, and it’s not in line with Steineke’s ""give and take"" description.

We looked through all of the patents assigned to both Gates and his foundation by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of now, none of them have to do with the novel coronavirus.
Federal guidelines stipulate that there is an 18-month confidentiality period after the first filing date. That means Gates or his foundation could have applied for a patent within the past 18 months and it would not be publicly listed.
There is no known treatment or vaccine for the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said a vaccine could take at least a year and a half to roll out.
The Gates Foundation is funding some of the 70 potential vaccines that are currently in development. The philanthropy said in a Feb. 5 statement that it is investing up to $60 million to ""accelerate the discovery, development and testing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics"" for the coronavirus.
Gates and his philanthropy frequently apply for patents with partner organizations. But as of now, they’re not listed on a future vaccine patent.

As American officials brace for new potential coronavirus outbreaks, a conspiracy theory about the cremation of victims in China is gaining traction online. The source is a website connected to Steve Bannon and an exiled Chinese billionaire.
A Facebook video published Feb. 25 by a page called China Declassified asserts that coronavirus patients in Wuhan are being ""cremated alive."" The Chinese city was where the virus, officially known as COVID-19, first broke out in December.
The 15-minute clip starts by showing two people wearing face masks in a car. Speaking in Chinese, a woman who is purportedly a Wuhan resident claims she witnessed Chinese officials put a coronavirus patient in plastic bags while still alive. 
The video then cuts to unrelated footage of the coronavirus outbreak and a newscast from NTD News.

The video was uploaded by Guo Wengui, a Chinese billionaire and political activist. Wengui fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party. Since then, Wengui, who is a member of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has become known for his criticism of Chinese leaders. 
A watermark for G News, the media arm of Wengui’s company Guo Media, appears on the YouTube video. The site, which also employs Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, has previously published misinformation about the coronavirus. Other conspiratorial websites, such as pro-Trump outlet the Epoch Times, have amplified the video on social media.
We could find no other evidence that Chinese officials are cremating coronavirus victims alive. And to be clear, at no point does the video offer any firsthand evidence. We reached out to G News for the source of Wengui’s video, but we haven’t heard back.

Facebook posts","No, the CDC isn’t recommending men shave their beards to protect against the coronavirus




If Your Time is short





A 2017 CDC infographic shows how facial hair could interfere with respirator masks.


The graphic is unrelated to coronavirus protection and the CDC has not recommended people should shave their beards to ward off the virus.





See the sources for this fact-check




Amid increased fears about a potential coronavirus outbreak in the United States, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention graphic from 2017 has resurfaced online along with the claim that the organization is recommending men shave their beards to protect against the virus.
This is not true. The organization has made no such recommendation. 
The wrong information developed out of a CNN wire story that was re-packaged by San Francisco-based news station Kron4.com. We saw it shared on plenty of other news websites.
The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Though the original Feb. 26 CNN story differs slightly, it also states that the CDC has suggestions about facial hair in relation with coronavirus protection, and fails to mention that the graphic is old and has no connection to the illness.
The infographic, which covers over 30 different types of facial hair styles, is from 2017 and is unrelated to the current coronavirus outbreak – or any other illness. It instead warns that some beard styles can interfere with face masks.
The graphic was originally posted in a CDC blog post that year during ""No Shave November"" that pointed out some of the problems certain types of beards could present with tight-fitting respirator masks. It’s one of several respiratory protection posters for the workplace compiled by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a CDC department.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The graphic is specific to respirators, which the CDC does not recommend using outside of the workplace for protection against the coronavirus: 
""CDC does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings (in the community). Most often, spread of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among close contacts (within 6 feet). CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue.""
For the record, a respirator is different than a surgical mask, as evidenced by this CDC graphic. Surgical masks aren’t considered adequate protection for respiratory illness, and only protect the face from large droplets and should be worn to shield others from your own coughs and sneezes.
Our ruling
A headline claims that the CDC recommends men shave their beards to protect against coronavirus.
The story, and others like it, say that facial hair can interfere with masks – and that isn’t untrue – but these posts in connection with the coronavirus are ultimately misleading. 
The story inaccurately says the CDC is telling people to shave their faces to help ward off the coronavirus and omits that the graphic was made years ago and unrelated to the current outbreak. It also misses health officials’ actual recommendation against using respirators for protection outside of the workplace.

Facebook posts","No, OSHA does not say that 'masks don’t work' against COVID-19




If Your Time is short





OSHA recommends that masks be worn to help slow the spread of COVID-19.


Masks aren’t a cure to prevent spread of COVID-19, experts say. But they are an effective tool in slowing transmission.





See the sources for this fact-check




When it comes to fighting the spread of COVID-19, the consensus among health authorities is that masks provide some measure of protection for people around the wearers.
So, has the federal agency charged with ensuring healthy conditions in the workplace declared that face coverings don’t work, and actually pose a health risk?
That’s the claim of an article (archived here) widely shared on Facebook that carries this headline:
""OSHA says masks don't work — and violate OSHA oxygen levels.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
In fact, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Department of Labor, recommends the use of masks.
Change in advice
Initially, the lead federal agency on the coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not recommend face coverings. That changed in April:
""We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.  In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.""
OSHA recommends masks
The article we’re checking is on a website called GreenMedInfo. The article doesn’t have text per se, but rather two videos and links to OSHA web pages. 
But we found that on its website, OSHA repeatedly recommends the use of face coverings:

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







From OSHA’s ""COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions"":
Cloth face coverings are worn in public over the nose and mouth ""to contain the wearer's potentially infectious respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and to limit the spread"" of the coronavirus. 
From OSHA’s ""Guidance on Returning to Work"": 
Employers must determine PPE (personal protective equipment) such as gloves, surgical masks and face shields) are necessary for employees. 
From OSHA’s ""Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19"":
""Provide a face mask, if feasible and available, and ask the person to wear it, if tolerated. ...Most workers at high or very high exposure risk likely need to wear gloves, a gown, a face shield or goggles, and either a face mask or a respirator, depending on their job tasks and exposure risks.""
OSHA’s response to the post
A Department of Labor spokeswoman told PolitiFact that OSHA ""generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work. Face coverings are intended to prevent wearers who have COVID-19 without knowing it from spreading potentially infectious respiratory droplets to others. 
""OSHA has not suggested they are ineffective for that purpose.""
The spokeswoman also said OSHA has not made any determination on whether masks have any impact on oxygen levels. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims ""OSHA says masks don't work"" to reduce COVID-19 transmission ""and violate OSHA oxygen levels."" OSHA actively recommends masks, when appropriate, in the workplace, and has made no determination on whether they affect a person’s oxygen levels.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump’s false claim that 99% of COVID-19 cases are harmless




If Your Time is short





Based on identified cases, the CDC shows a cumulative case death rate of 4.5%


About 4% of new cases require hospitalization.


Doctors are beginning to see longer term impacts on patients who had mild cases that never sent them to the hospital.





See the sources for this fact-check




In a Fourth of July celebration with jets flying overhead and soldiers parachuting through the air, President Donald Trump minimized the threat of the coronavirus. With cases surging across many states, Trump said the latest numbers were promising.
""We have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump said July 4. ""By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country will show, because no other country has testing that we have — not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.""
""Totally harmless"" is a strong term, and while people can debate the finer points of what represents harm, no definition backs up Trump’s 99% figure.

We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for the underlying data and did not hear back.
A case death rate over 4%
Death is the least likely outcome of catching this disease. If Trump’s figure was going to be right, it would show up in how many people the virus has killed.
Counting deaths from COVID-19 is an inexact science, but no data source shows a rate lower than 4.2%, based on the numbers of identified cases
According to the government’s tally at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the virus hit, there have been about 2.8 million cases. The death toll has reached nearly 130,000. 
That would produce a case death rate of 4.5%.
Remember, researchers don’t know the number of people infected — only the confirmed cases. The infection tally would be larger than the number of identified cases.
Some researchers expect the global fatality rate to come down, with the caveat that it will be higher for more vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and people with underlying health problems.
Other examples of harm
Epidemiologists say we continue to learn more about COVID-19 and the damage it causes short of death.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







""To cavalierly say that only 1% of infections result in problems is wildly inaccurate,"" said  Donald Thea, Boston University professor of global health. ""We are seeing reports of young people who have recovered from mild cases developing diabetes or blood clots and suffering from chronic fatigue, respiratory compromise, persistent fever or coming back with bacterial sepsis weeks later. There's too many reports of other organ damage that hints that there are possible long term serious implications.""
And that doesn’t speak to hospitalizations. By most standards, anything that sends someone to the hospital has done significant damage.
Numbers from the COVID Tracking Project give some idea of the hospitalization trends. Unlike the cumulative death rate, this data gives a window into the number of hospitalizations that emerged out of each day’s newly identified cases. The rate has been falling since early June, when it was 8%. But it still sits at 4%, or four times higher than Trump’s 1% figure.

 
Total infections — the great unknown
Researchers agree that while counting the number of cases is important, one of the most important aspects of the coronavirus remains murky — how many people have been infected by the virus.
This is very different from looking at the known cases, because it includes the people who never show symptoms. By one CDC estimate, the total could be 10 to 12 times higher than the number of identified cases. If deaths and hospitalizations remained the same, the threat of death and harm would fall dramatically.
The problem is, Thea said, we lack reliable numbers to fill in any of those boxes. He expects the estimated number of infections to grow, but so will the estimated number of deaths.
""We’re undercounting those deaths by 20% to 40%, conservatively,"" Thea said. ""There is a year-to-year-stability in death rates. We’ve seen an enormous amount of excess deaths, and the large majority of the excess mortality is due to the infection itself."" 
Our ruling
Trump said that 99% of all COVID-19 cases are totally harmless. The White House provided no supporting data.
Looking at the worst possible outcome, the government’s numbers show a cumulative death rate of 4.5%, although the actual fatality rate could end up lower once we learn more about the disease 
The rate at which new cases lead to hospitalizations has fallen, but it still remains at 4%. And public health researchers note that more and more, there are reports that even people with mild cases are hit with medical problems after they’ve recovered.
There’s a lot more to be learned about this disease, but nothing says that it’s harmless for 99% of the people it touches.

Other news outlets including FactCheck.org and Reuters have also debunked claims that philanthropist Bill Gates planned to use microchip implants to combat coronavirus.
This claim about microchips may have originated from a misinterpretation of a statement Gates made about possibly using ""digital certificates"" for health records on immunity. But he never said those certificates would be contained in microchips going into people. 
Gates’s interest in digital certificates may have also triggered false claims that he was pushing tracking bracelets and ""invisible tattoos"" to monitor Americans under lockdown.
Fauci, too, has spoken about digital certificates of immunity.
""You know, that’s possible,"" Fauci told CNN when asked if he could imagine a time where Americans carried certificates of immunity. ""It’s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not. This is something that’s being discussed. I think it might actually have some merit under certain circumstances.""

The claims in the post are speculative and misleading in a number of ways, and have been debunked by another fact-checking organization.
COVID-19 has killed more than half a million people worldwide, including nearly 130,000 in the U.S. Companies around the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine, and many potential vaccines are undergoing safety trials in humans. 
Health officials are struggling to reassure some skeptics that a vaccine can be developed quickly without compromising safety.
As of June 30, only one coronavirus vaccine had been approved for limited use. The Chinese government has approved it only for military personnel. 
Currently there is no coronavirus vaccine that has been approved for the American public. And there is no evidence that children have died because they received one of the COVID-19 vaccines being developed.

In April, PolitiFact investigated a claim that seven children in Senegal died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and discovered the Facebook post’s claim was false. 
In May, Reuters also reported that social media posts were incorrect in claiming that a TV news report from 2019 showed the deadly results of a COVID-19 vaccination trial in Guinea. 
PolitiFact found no evidence that anyone has died from complications related to a trial COVID-19 vaccination.
PolitiFact has also debunked several false claims involving the coronavirus vaccine and microchips. The U.S. isn’t developing an ""antivirus"" for COVID-19 that will include an RFID chip, for example. There’s also no evidence that Democrats are pushing for mandatory vaccinations or microchip implants to fight the coronavirus.
And there is no evidence yet of any requirement that students be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to school, though some states could require it if a vaccine becomes available. 
State laws govern immunization requirements for schoolchildren, including those in private schools and daycare centers, but all states allow exemptions for medical reasons, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and some allow exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump’s false claim that COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu




If Your Time is short





The average number of flu deaths each year has been about 36,000.


So far, about 210,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19.


COVID-19 is estimated to be about 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump’s fight with COVID-19 has left him striking a defiant tone. When he headed back to the White House from the hospital, he advised people on Twitter, ""Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.""
He followed that up with another tweet the next morning.
""Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu,"" he wrote Oct. 6. ""Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!""
Twitter has now flagged that tweet for ""sharing misleading and potentially harmful information"" about COVID-19. For the same reason, a similar post from Trump on Facebook was taken down completely. 
In the U.S. so far this year, about 210,000 people have died from COVID-19.
Trump’s figure for the number of people who have died from seasonal flu is wrong on its face, and distorts the government’s actual estimates.
For the worst season this decade — 2017-18 — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the death toll at 61,000. Taking into account uncertainties in reporting flu deaths, the CDC offered a range of 46,000 to 95,000 deaths.
But the more typical range is significantly lower.

The average number of deaths per year over the past decade has been 35,900. And even taking the high-end of the range for each year, the average is 51,800. That’s half Trump’s number.
Infectious disease researcher Marm Kilpatrick at University of California Santa Cruz said one has to go back to 1968 to find a seasonal death toll of 100,000 — and that was when a brand new strain emerged.
Trump also said that for ""most populations,"" COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu.
That’s also wrong, but it reflects that the patterns for the two diseases are different.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







The CDC reports that flu is most deadly for children and the elderly. The CDC said that ""the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19.""
Broadly, for people of all ages who show flu symptoms, the CDC data shows a death rate of about 0.1%. Given that the CDC says only about half of all flu infections lead to symptoms, the actual infection fatality rate could be in the range of 0.05%.
Data on COVID-19 remains a moving target, and current estimates should be seen in that light.
Using the CDC’s age-specific data on COVID-19, and the U.S. age distribution, Kilpatrick estimated the infection death rate for COVID-19 is about 0.7%. That’s in the ballpark of other estimates, and would make the coronavirus more than 10 times more deadly than the flu.
Drilling into the details for different age groups, Kilpatrick cautioned that the data is still emerging. But he said the best comparison he’s found of the death rates among age groups for COVID-19 and the seasonal flu comes from independent researcher Marc Bevand.
Bevand drew on 13 studies of COVID-19 and the CDC’s influenza data. In every age group over the age of 30, COVID-19 was more deadly than the flu.
For people in their 30s, COVID-19 was 2.9 times more deadly. For those in their 70s, it was 14.4 times deadlier.
The CDC doesn’t provide an apples-to-apples comparison of flu and COVID-19 deaths by age. It currently estimates that the COVID-19 death rate ranges from .003% for children and teens to 5.4% for people 70 and up. 

We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign and did not hear back.
Our ruling
Trump said that more than 100,000 people die from the flu and ""in most populations, COVID-19 is far less lethal.""
In the past decade, the average yearly death toll from the flu has been 35,900. About 50 years ago, 100,000 people died one year, but that was an anomaly.
Overall, the data show that COVID-19 is more deadly than the flu. By one estimate, it is 10 times more deadly.
Comparing death rates for age groups is more challenging, but the data shows that for everyone over 30, COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu.

A video from Breitbart shows a group of doctors airing unproven conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. Before social media platforms removed it, the video was viewed millions of times. President Donald Trump retweeted it.


There is no known cure for COVID-19. And public health officials advise everyone to wear face masks in public to prevent the spread of the virus.


The Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Research on whether the drug could assuage symptoms is not conclusive.





See the sources for this fact-check




Millions of people, including the president of the United States, have seen or shared a video in which a doctor falsely claims there is a cure for the coronavirus, and it’s a medley starring hydroxychloroquine.
The video shows several doctors in white coats giving a press conference outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. It persists on social media despite bans from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and it was published by Breitbart, a conservative news site. 
The July 27 event was organized by Tea Party Patriots, a conservative group backed by Republican donors, and attended by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C.
In the video, members of a new group called America’s Frontline Doctors touch on several unproven conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. One of the most inaccurate claims comes from Dr. Stella Immanuel, a Houston-based primary care physician and minister with a track record of making bizarre medical claims, such as believing in alien DNA.
""This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,"" Immanuel said. ""I know you people want to talk about a mask. Hello? You don’t need a mask. There is a cure.""
As of July 27, nearly 150,000 Americans had died because of the coronavirus. Could those deaths have been prevented by a drug that’s used to treat lupus and arthritis?
No. Immanuel’s statement is wrong on several points.
‘This virus has a cure’
There is no known cure for COVID-19. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no specific antiviral treatment for the virus. Supportive care, such as rest, fluids and fever relievers, can assuage symptoms.
""There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19,"" according to the World Health Organization.
The cure is ‘hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax’
In spite of Immanuel’s anecdotal evidence, hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other drugs is not a proven treatment (or cure) for COVID-19.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In mid-June, the FDA revoked its emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
""It is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,"" FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton wrote.
The WHO and the National Institutes of Health have also stopped their hydroxychloroquine studies. Among the safety issues associated with treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine include heart rhythm problems, kidney injuries, and liver problems. 
While some studies have found that the drug could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, the research is not conclusive. Few studies have been accepted into peer-reviewed journals. And large, randomized trials — the gold standard for clinical trials — are still needed to confirm the findings of studies conducted since the pandemic began.
In the video, Immanuel cited a 2005 study that found chloroquine — not hydroxychloroquine — was ""effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV,"" the official name for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. But the drug was not tested on humans, the authors wrote that more research was needed to make any conclusions, and SARS is different from COVID-19.
‘You don’t need a mask’
Health officials advise everyone to wear masks in public.
The reason why has to do with how the coronavirus spreads. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they expel respiratory droplets containing the virus. Those droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.
Since some people infected with the coronavirus may exhibit no symptoms, public health officials say everyone should cover their faces in public — even if they feel well.
""The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth face coverings are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces,"" according to the CDC.
Our ruling
In a viral video, Immanuel said there is a cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine can treat it and people don’t need to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
All of those claims are inaccurate. There is no known cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment, and public health officials advise everyone to wear face masks in public.

Facebook posts","Face masks, including homemade ones, are effective COVID-19 protection, experts say




If Your Time is short





N95 masks offer the most protection from viral particles, health officials say, but they should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients.


Mask effectiveness varies, but claims that cloth masks provide 0% protection aren’t accurate.


More studies need to be done to examine variables such as the material and fit of the mask, the wearer, and the environment.


Health officials largely agree that wearing any kind of face mask, coupled with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, is more protective than going unmasked.





See the sources for this fact-check




Face masks have become a controversial symbol of the fight against COVID-19. 
Varying state rules and shifting guidance from leading health officials has caused confusion over who should be wearing masks and whether some types are effective at slowing disease transmission. 
Take this Facebook post, for example. It displays an image of four different masks: An N95, a surgical mask, a sponge and a cloth mask.
It claims that N95 and surgical masks both provide 95% protection, while sponge and cloth masks offer none.
Let’s just get to the point: This isn’t true.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 

Medical masks, like the N95, offer the most protection, but experts widely agree that several types of facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, are effective at slowing virus spread. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially deterred people from wearing face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. But that guidance changed on April 3, after studies found that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, or before symptoms start to show. Now, the CDC recommends that nearly everyone wear a facial covering in public and in areas where social distancing isn’t possible.
Officials say the most effective homemade masks should fit snugly and be made of thick cloth.
RELATED: To fight COVID-19, CDC now says wear masks in public
A comparison between masks is flawed for a couple of reasons. 
First, the N95, and other medical masks, are in high demand and officials say they should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients. 
Second, multiple studies that look at the efficacy of lower-grade fabric masks have shown that they, too, help block particles. 
""The protection from cloth masks isn’t 0, and it’s definitely not 100, but the way to think about any of the masks and our overall approach is how do you put together all the pieces of the puzzle to give you a complete picture of minimizing the risk of transmission of COVID-19?"" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard’s school of public health. ""Hand washing, wearing masks, and social distancing is part of it, but none of them alone. It’s how you put together these different tools to meet the task at hand. Wearing any mask is a very, very small price to pay to be safe and return to society.""
Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, told PolitiFact that masks provide some protection but the amount can vary widely depending on the type and how it's worn. Masks reduce the amount of virus spread and also the amount one might inhale, she said. 
It’s not true, she said, that cloth masks provide 0% protection.

""There have been measurements showing that homemade mask materials offer up to 80% protection,"" Marr said, ""which is much better than 0%, although not as good as an N95. Still, reducing the amount of virus that we inhale by 80% is better than nothing.""
A smattering of studies have looked at the efficacy of different masks in different ways.
One experiment from researchers at the National Institutes of Health used lasers to illuminate and measure how many droplets of saliva were released into the air by a person talking with and without a cloth facial covering. 
As can be seen in a video of the experiment, a cluster of droplets appear in the air when the researcher speaks without a mask, but nearly all the particles are blocked when he does the same with a mask. The study didn’t capture micro-droplets, and more research needs to be done on how many viral particles these smaller droplets can contain, but it demonstrated that a cloth mask is better than no mask.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health conducted a study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses. The report found that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in respiratory droplets.
Arizona State University mathematicians recently developed a model for assessing the community impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public.
That study found that a broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks ""may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths,"" and said masks are useful to both prevent illness in healthy persons and prevent asymptomatic transmission.
""Typical protection (of fabric masks) is probably at least 50%, high quality masks could be 80–95% protective, and even low quality masks made of very thin materials could still be 10–20% protective,"" said Steffen Eikenberry, a postdoctoral scholar in the school of mathematical and statistical sciences and one of the main authors of the study.
""While evidence is still very limited, several laboratory studies indicate that the majority of homemade mask materials, including cotton fabric, cotton T-shirts, tea cloth, flannel, silk, linen, scarves, and chiffon offer at least 50% protection. Higher quality, more tightly woven fabrics are better, and multiple layers improves protection.""
Jeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco, wrote an article in the Conversation in favor of universal mask wearing.
Howard says that researchers were looking at the wrong question at first – how well a mask protects the wearer from infection – and not how well a mask prevents an infected person from spreading the virus. He said masks function very differently as personal protective equipment versus ""source control.""
""Masks are very good at blocking larger droplets and not nearly as good at blocking tiny particles,"" he wrote. ""When a person expels droplets into the air, they quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles called droplet nuclei. These are extremely hard to remove from the air. However, in the moist atmosphere between a person’s mouth and their mask, it takes nearly a hundred times as long for a droplet to evaporate and shrink into a droplet nuclei.""
He continued: ""This means that nearly any kind of simple cloth mask is great for source control. The mask creates humidity, this humidity prevents virus-containing droplets from turning into droplet nuclei, and this allows the fabric of the mask to block the droplets.""
Our ruling
Social media posts claim that certain face masks are ineffective and provide ""0% protection.""
More research needs to be done but we found that medical experts widely refute the claim. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snuggly and are made of multiple layers.
No mask is 100% effective, but health care officials stress that face masks increase their effectiveness when combined with other measures, such as social distancing and regular hand washing.

If Your Time is short



• An eviction moratorium for properties linked to federal housing financing was included in the CARES Act, a major coronavirus relief bill. The moratorium expired in late July.
• Trump’s executive order doesn’t extend the moratorium. Instead, it takes a softer approach by telling executive branch officials to think about possible solutions to evictions during the coronavirus pandemic and its related economic downturn. The executive order also says nothing about any December deadline.



See the sources for this fact-check




Some Facebook users jumped the gun on a series of executive actions signed by President Donald Trump after bipartisan negotiations on a new coronavirus relief bill ground to a halt.
One of the four orders Trump signed on Aug. 8 addressed eviction policy, an urgent matter given the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted a severe economic downturn and caused many renters to lose their jobs. An eviction moratorium that had been included in the coronavirus relief bill known as the CARES Act expired on July 24 and has not yet been extended. Between 30 million and 40 million people could be at risk of eviction over the next few months without an extended moratorium, the National Low-Income Housing Coalition estimated.
The Aug. 8 Facebook post said lawmakers wasted time on negotiations when Trump was taking forceful actions.
Trump, the post said, ""put a hold on ALL EVICTIONS through December."" It went on to say that Trump ""is for the people whether you like him or not. This executive order he just signed is going to save a lot of y’all asses.""
But it is not accurate to say Trump extended eviction protections until December.
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
What the CARES Act did on evictions
First, some background on the previous eviction moratorium from the CARES Act.
That law, which was passed with almost universal bipartisan support and was signed by Trump on March 27, 2020, provided a 120-day eviction moratorium for renters in specific categories. Those categories included renters who received federal housing assistance (such as by living in public housing or receiving federal financial assistance or tax credits), as well as renters who lived in properties in which the landlord’s mortgage is backed by the federal government, including the mortgage-bundling entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
However, the ban in the CARES Act expired on July 24, and to date, it has not been extended.
A different federal eviction moratorium is still in place, but it is set to end on Aug. 31. That one, imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, pauses mortgages and evictions for single-family homes that have mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Separately, renters may have protections under state or local policies.
What Trump’s executive order did
Trump’s executive order falls well short of extending the moratorium from the CARES Act. Instead, it tells executive branch officials to think about possible solutions rather than formally imposing a moratorium. (The executive order also doesn’t mention extending anything ""through December."")
Here are the key provisions of Trump’s order:
• It tells the Health and Human Services secretary and the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ""consider whether any measures temporarily halting residential evictions of any tenants for failure to pay rent are reasonably necessary.""
• It tells the Treasury secretary and Housing and Urban Development secretary to identify federal funds that can be applied to ""temporary financial assistance to renters and homeowners.""
• It tells the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to identify ""resources that may be used to prevent evictions and foreclosures for renters and homeowners"" caused by the pandemic. (As an independent agency, it’s unclear whether the president can order the agency to do anything.)
Unlike the CARES Act eviction ban, ""the executive order does not ‘put a hold’ on evictions at all,"" said Andrew Scherer, the policy director of New York Law School’s Impact Center for Public Interest Law.
Our ruling
The Facebook post said that Trump ""put a hold on ALL EVICTIONS through December.""
That’s incorrect. The executive order tells executive branch officials to think about possible solutions, rather than formally imposing a moratorium, as the now-expired CARES Act language did, at least for properties with a linkage to federal housing finance. The executive order also says nothing about a December deadline.

The seed of the Facebook conspiracy is the fact that the company has a location in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. And documents from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission show that Soros was a WuXi shareholder in May 2011. (Subsequent SEC filings do not list the company among Soros’ investments, perhaps because he changed the legal status of his hedge fund that summer to avoid more government regulation.)
But none of that amounts to what the Facebook posts claims: that Soros ""owns"" the company and its Wuhan location. WuXi’s CEO and chairman is Ge Li, according to its website. 
And scientists have found that COVID-19’s origin is likely natural — not man-made, as the Facebook post and several other conspiracy theories allege.

Marco Rubio","Marco Rubio says Anthony Fauci lied about masks. Fauci didn’t.




If Your Time is short





In early March, Fauci said “there's no reason to be walking around with a mask.”


In the same interview, he said people could wear masks if they liked, but they wouldn’t get perfect protection, and it would further pinch what at the time was a short supply of masks for doctors and nurses.


After researchers discovered that asymptomatic people were spreading the virus, the public health community shifted to recommending that everyone wear a mask.





See the sources for this fact-check




At 9:33 on the morning of Dec. 27, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted a verse from the Bible that urged people to rise above the faults they see in others.
""Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience,"" Rubio wrote. ""Forgiving one another if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do.""
By 10:45 a.m., Rubio struck a different tone.
""Dr. Fauci lied about masks in March,"" Rubio tweeted. ""Dr. Fauci has been distorting the level of vaccination needed for herd immunity.""
 
Lying involves the intent to deceive, and the claim that Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, lied about masks is familiar ground for fact-checkers. It doesn’t hold up.
We have looked at what Fauci has said at different points during the pandemic, and his guidance has changed. The question is: Why?
Top government agencies such as the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted their policies on masks based on new findings about the novel coronavirus. It wasn’t until April 3 that the CDC urged everyone to wear one.
Before then, the message on masks was primarily about preserving a limited supply for health care workers, who were at especially high risk of exposure.
What Fauci said in March interviews
Rubio’s tweet specifically referred to what Fauci said in March. That month, Fauci gave two high-profile interviews. In the first one, which occurred days before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Fauci pushed back against the idea of everyone in the U.S. needing to wear masks.
It is worth reading Fauci’s exact words from his March 8 interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes."":
FAUCI: The masks are important for someone who's infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now, when you see people and look at the films in China and South Korea, whatever, and everybody's wearing a mask. Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.
HOST: You're sure of this, because people are listening really closely to this. 
FAUCI: Right. Now people should not be walk— there's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.
And often there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face. 
HOST: And you can get some schmutz sort of staying inside there.
FAUCI: Of course, but when you think ""masks,"" you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people — when you look at the films of countries, and you see 85% of the people wearing masks, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not against it. If you want to do it, that's fine. 
HOST: But it can lead to a shortage.

By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







FAUCI: Exactly, that’s the point. It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.
Fauci’s critics have focused on his words ""there's no reason to be walking around with a mask."" But in the same interview, he also said that it was ""fine"" to wear a mask, although it wouldn’t offer perfect protection. And he said the main point was to preserve masks for those who were already ill and people providing care.
On March 27, Fauci spoke to a San Francisco NBC affiliate. He said given the shortage of masks, the general public ranked last behind doctors and nurses, and people who are infected.
""When we say you don't need to wear a mask, what we're really saying is make sure you prioritize it first for the people who need the mask,"" Fauci said. ""In a perfect world, if you had all the masks you wanted, then you could get some degree of protection, but make sure you prioritize it well.""
Guidance changed over the course of the month
March was a pivotal month for understanding the disease. On March 1, the country had seen eight deaths. On March 31, the figure stood at more than 4,300.
When public officials talked about masks, they were talking about high-quality, hospital grade masks. In February and March, when the spread of the virus was still limited in the U.S., the mask shortage was a top concern. 
On March 2, the FDA and CDC were saying ""There is no added health benefit to the general American public to wear a respiratory protective device, such as an N95 respirator. The immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.""
On an emergency basis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration relaxed the rules on the sort of masks hospitals could use, citing tight supplies of the high-grade masks.
The shortage was nationwide, and became more acute as the virus spread. On March 23, a bipartisan group of physician lawmakers in Utah called on businesses to donate N95 masks for use by health workers.
On March 29, President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force briefed the press on steps underway to increase the supply of masks to doctors, nurses and all care providers.
By this time, COVID-19s had spread widely across the country, and public-health officials were rethinking their guidance as they learned more about the transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers.
On April 3, Trump announced, ""From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood.
""In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,"" Trump said. ""I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard.""
We reached out to Rubio’s office and did not get a formal response, but his deputy chief of staff posted a non-responsive tweet.
Our ruling
Rubio said that Fauci lied about masks in March. This is incorrect in several ways.
Fauci did say, ""there is no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" but to call that lying takes Fauci’s words out of context. The country faced a shortage of high-quality masks, and Fauci also said in his interviews that masks should be preserved for sick people and health care workers.
In addition, researchers did not know at the time that people without symptoms were spreading the virus. Once that was understood, wearing masks — even simple cloth masks — took on new importance for preventing community transmission.
Lying means there was an intent to deceive. Fauci’s words in March about masks mirrored the widely held belief across government agencies at that time about the nature of the novel coronavirus and the best ways to control it.
We rate this claim False.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump’s false claim that doctors inflate COVID-19 deaths to make more money




If Your Time is short





Doctors and coroners fill out death certificates according to established rules and face legal penalties for falsification.


Hospitals must prove to Washington that patients tested positive for the virus, and their doctors gain nothing from a COVID-19 diagnosis. 


There is no evidence that official death counts over report the reach of the disease. 





See the sources for this fact-check




A few weeks ago, President Donald Trump had praise for doctors on the frontlines of treating coronavirus patients.
""Since the plague arrived from China, we have seen our doctors, nurses, first responders, scientists, and researchers at their very best,"" he said Sept. 24.
Trump has changed his tune. In his recent rallies, with COVID-19 cases skyrocketing and deaths climbing, he has taken to accusing physicians of inflating deaths to line their pockets.
""Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID,"" he told supporters at a rally in Waterford, Mich., Oct. 30. ""You know that, right? I mean, our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, ‘I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.’""  
This is a persistent theory that lacks any proof.
Johns Hopkins University researchers reported that the virus has killed more than 230,000 people. There is no evidence that figure is exaggerated. If anything, public health analysts say it likely undercounts the reach of the disease.
And while the government offers 20% more for the care of Medicare patients with COVID-19, the majority of doctors work for hospital systems. That means whatever higher payments might come, they don't go to them.
In order for Trump’s claim to have an appreciable impact on reported deaths, thousands of doctors would need to lie on death certificates without any financial benefit.
We recently rated False a similar claim from Trump that focused on hospitals.
Trump’s words imply that death certificates are subject to the whim of physicians. That’s wrong, and here’s why.
Death certificate rules
Ashish K. Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, noted there are legal sanctions for falsifying death records.
""Doctors aren't taking random deaths and calling them COVID deaths,"" Jha wrote Oct. 27 in the website MedScape. ""That would be fraud.""
Jha also dismissed the impact of additional payments. He gave the example of a patient who spends more than four days on a ventilator.
""Without COVID, Medicare pays about $35,000 for that patient's care,"" Jha wrote. ""With COVID, about $40,000.""
In a tweet, Jha noted that to get this bump, the hospital must prove that the patient tested positive for COVID-19.
 
Payment rules
For the first time ever, in 2018, the number of doctors working for hospitals exceeded those who worked in independent practices. This means that the additional payments Trump referenced don’t apply to most doctors. A COVID-19 diagnosis doesn’t change what they charge.

""Hospitals are paid that way, not doctors,"" said Maggie McGillick, spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. ""Doctors are typically paid based on the service they deliver.""
The majority of deaths take place in hospitals and nursing homes. Trump’s statement would mean that doctors who stand to make no financial gain would put themselves at legal risk by falsifying a death record.
Decisions on how to classify a given death are made by local doctors or coroners, but they are based on World Health Organization guidelines followed by the U.S. and nearly every other country. 
The approach to identifying an underlying cause is laid out by the World Health Organization, which says a ""death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma).""
No evidence of over reporting
The CDC reported that as of early October, the U.S. had about 300,000 more deaths in 2020 than would be expected in a typical year, two-thirds of which can be attributed directly to COVID-19. The data snapshot was based on Oct. 3 figures.
That would put the death toll at 200,000, which was very close to the number reported by another regular source, the COVID Tracking Project.
But the CDC went further.
""As of Oct. 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States,"" the report said. ""However, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality."" 
This is consistent with other studies that show no overcount of deaths from the virus.
Physicians push back
Individually and collectively, doctors have rejected Trump’s claim.
Philadelphia physician Dr. Priya Mammen tweeted that many frontline workers are buying their own personal protective equipment because hospitals don’t have enough. Mammen said many of her colleagues are ""exhausted by saving lives of preventable COVID.""
The American College of Emergency Physicians said Trump’s implication that doctors seek to gain financially is ""offensive.""
""Emergency physicians and other health care workers have risked their lives day in and day out for almost a year battling the greatest public health crisis in a generation — all while watching countless patients die alone, going to work without sufficient protection equipment, and struggling with crushing anxiety about getting sick or spreading the virus to their loved ones,"" the group said Oct. 25.
We reached out to the Trump campaign for evidence that doctors are inflating the death figures. We did not hear back.
Our ruling
Trump said that doctors inflate the number of COVID-19 deaths to ""get more money. ... So what they do is they say, ‘I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.’""  
There is no evidence to back this up.
Doctors and coroners follow established guidelines on the cause of death, and false reporting is a crime. A plurality of doctors work for hospitals and have no financial incentive to falsify death records.
Medicare does pay more for COVID-19 patients, but hospitals must prove a positive diagnosis for the disease. 
A CDC analysis, in line with other research, finds the reported deaths from COVID-19 likely underestimate deaths from the virus.

Nancy Pelosi","Donald Trump doesn’t meet the definition of morbidly obese




If Your Time is short




Donald Trump does not fit the CDC’s description of “severely obese.”

 
Stories have questioned both Trump’s height and weight. But even if Trump isn’t telling the truth, it’s extremely unlikely he would be classified as morbidly or severely obese.

 




See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump brought his health to the national coronavirus conversation on May 18 when he told reporters that he was taking hydroxychloroquine, a longstanding anti-malaria drug, as a preventative measure against COVID-19.
Trump’s confidence in the drug against COVID-19 has not been supported by most studies. In fact, physicians say that the drug has serious side effects for patients, especially if they have pre-existing conditions such as heart problems.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper she was concerned for other reasons. In the interview, Cooper asked Pelosi what she thought of Trump saying he is taking the drug. 
""I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group,"" Pelosi said. ""He’s morbidly obese, they say."" 
Pelosi’s comment probably was meant to get under Trump’s skin. Trump has ridiculed other people’s heights and weights in the past, while others have questioned whether he’s been accurate in describing his own height and weight.
But morbid obesity, or severe obesity, is a term of science, and weight is a risk factor for COVID-19.
We decided to see what we could find out. Pelosi’s office did not offer a comment.
The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump responded to Pelosi’s comments at a May 19 news conference, calling Pelosi ""a sick woman"" with ""a lot of mental problems."" 
Officially, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not define the threshhold needed for someone to be considered ""morbidly obese."" Instead, the CDC says that ""Class 3"" obesity, sometimes categorized as ""extreme"" or ""severe"" obesity, is defined as having a body-mass index, or BMI, of 40 or higher. Other medical sources list a definition of ""morbidly obese"" as equivalent to a BMI of 40 or higher.
Some available data about Trump comes from his most recent periodic physical exam. In a 2019 memo, Trump’s physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump was 6 feet, 3 inches tall and 243 pounds.
Trump, who was 72 at the time, had gained 4 pounds since his 2018 exam, when his previous doctor, Ronny Jackson, said Trump’s ""overall health is excellent"" but ""he would benefit from a diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates and from a routine exercise regiment.""
Officially, Trump’s height and weight would correlate to a BMI of 30.1, just a bit over the 30.0 level to be considered obese — the lowest of three levels. That is not high enough to count as Class 3 obesity.

Based on the 2019 physical exam, Trump ""would not be considered morbidly obese at this time,"" said Lucas Carr, a professor in the department of health and human physiology at the University of Iowa.
Paresh Dandona, the head of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the State University of New York, agreed with this observation.
Height and weight questioners
Some critics, such as MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, say they think Trump is neither 6-foot-3 (a New York driver’s license listed him as 6 feet, 2 inches), nor does he weigh around 240 pounds.
""By the way he's picked up, magically picked up, he's 2 inches taller now than he was a couple years ago, right?"" Scarborough said on his MSNBC show in 2019. 
""I'm sorry, I'm a guy that weighs about 240, 241,"" he said. ""This guy, this guy is, he's pushing 300, there's no doubt about it,"" Scarborough said. ""Maybe he's 270, maybe he's 280.""
The Washington Post went so far in 2016 as to have experts guess Trump’s weight. Their answers: 250-260 pounds; 228-242 pounds; 252-255 pounds; at least 240 ""maybe more"".
To have a BMI above 40, with the highest of those weights (260 pounds), Trump would need to be shorter than 5 feet, 8 inches. He’s not.
Weight, age risk factors 
Pelosi does have a point that an individual’s age and weight are risk factors for worse outcomes after a coronavirus infection. Many studies connect obesity with COVID-19 complications, and data has shown higher death rates for older patients than younger ones. The CDC warns on their ""Defining Adult Obesity"" page that ""severe obesity (a BMI of 40 or higher) may raise risk"" of a severe reaction to COVID-19. 
The CDC also warns that ""older adults, 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19."" Trump is 73.
Our ruling
Pelosi called Trump ""morbidly obese.""
Based off of his declared height and weight, Trump has a body mass index of 30.1. This places him into the lowest of three levels under the CDC’s definition of obesity. Even if the public numbers are a bit shy of reality, Trump would have to be substantially heavier to meet a level of severe, or morbid, obesity.
We rate Pelosi’s claim False.

The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. (such as Moderna and Pfizer) were tested in humans, and have proven to be safe and effective.

A widely shared social media post claims that the technology used in two of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. had not been tested in humans — and asserts that assurances it is safe and effective are wrong.
The post on Instagram, which also appeared on Twitter, states:
""mRNA technology has been around for decades. It had never gone past animal trials due to catastrophic side effects, including death. This technology was never 'fixed’. Now mankind is being pressured to take it, with assurances that it is safe and effective. That is bulls---.""

The two vaccines that use mRNA technology, one made by Moderna and the other by Pfizer-BioNTech, were tested in tens of thousands of humans. They have been administered to more than 177 million people in the U.S. and have been shown to be safe and effective.

The messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology used to create the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots dates to the 1990s, though this is the first time it has been used in widely disseminated vaccines. 
These two mRNA vaccines use the human body’s natural immune response to their advantage. The shots give cells the directions for how to make a harmless  spike protein. Such spike proteins are found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 — and it is these proteins that the virus uses to bind to cells. The immune system of a person who receives the mRNA vaccine then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to fight it. 
The third vaccine used in the U.S., by Johnson & Johnson, is different. Instead of RNA, it uses a disabled adenovirus to deliver instructions to produce the coronavirus’ spike proteins and activate the immune system. 
The testing
The mRNA technology previously was tested against other viruses like influenza; Moderna began its testing in 2015. In 2018, Pfizer and BioNTech announced a partnership to start developing an mRNA vaccine to prevent influenza. The various development efforts shifted to creating an mRNA vaccine for the coronavirus when the pandemic hit.

The testing of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was done on tens of thousands of people. Pfizer and Moderna got approval to test their shots on animals while simultaneously running Phase I trials on humans, prior to the vaccines getting emergency use authorization from the FDA in December 2020 for distribution to the general public. 
Safety and effectiveness
More than 177 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, with minimal complications reported despite the massive sample size.
Among people who are fully vaccinated, the mRNA vaccines reduce the risk of COVID-19, including severe illness, by 90% or more, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
While a number of claims have been made suggesting that the vaccine is unsafe or has resulted in dangerous side-effects, PolitiFact has found that most of them stem from incomplete use of data contained in a federal database known as Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. The database is a critical tool for researchers, but a breeding ground for misinformation about vaccine after-effects. Anyone can submit a report, and the reports are widely accessible. But the reports are not verified.
""Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem,"" the CDC says. ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."". 
Serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare but can occur. For example, CDC and FDA have confirmed 393 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis — inflammation of the heart — in people after mRNA vaccination.
Our ruling
A widely circulated social media post claimed that the mRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines was never tested in humans, ""now mankind is being pressured to take it, with assurances that it is safe and effective.""
The two predominant COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., Moderna and Pfizer, use mRNA technology and were tested in tens of thousands of humans before they were authorized. The clinical trials and the real-world results have shown both vaccines to be safe and effective.

See the sources for this fact-check




During a speech in Warren, Mich., Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic by reminding listeners of the death toll from the virus.
""U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan: 53,188,"" Biden said. ""U.S. COVID infected in America: 6,344,700. U.S. COVID deaths: 189,506. Military COVID infected: 118,984. Military COVID deaths: 6,114. Folks, every one of these lives matter. Every one of these lives left somebody behind grieving.""
However, the Defense Department has publicly announced that through early September, seven servicemembers have died from the coronavirus and nearly 38,500 had been infected — numbers far below what Biden cited. There have also been 50 civilian deaths, seven deaths of dependents and 20 contractor deaths due to the virus, Military Times reported.

Greg Murphy","No, sunlight has not been proven to kill coronavirus




If Your Time is short




Dr. Greg Murphy, a Republican Congressman from North Carolina, said sunlight can kill the novel coronavirus.
This is a common theory because sunlight contains ultraviolet rays, which can kill bacteria.
However, experts say the sun's UV light isn't intense enough to rely on as a disinfectant. 




See the sources for this fact-check




As the nation tries to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, politicians are offering tips of their own.
U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican, is one of them.
Murphy is a physician who won the seat in a special election last year after longtime congressman Walter Jones passed away. Murphy has been posting videos on Twitter, wherein he explains the effects of the virus and the federal government’s response.
In a video posted March 16, Murphy stands next to a white board wearing his scrubs.
Most of his tips are on-point. He says cold weather won’t kill the novel coronavirus (true). He says gargling hot water doesn’t kill coronavirus (also true).
But Murphy also says this.
""Sunlight actually can kill the virus. But we have to be cautious about that. It’s good to be out in the sun, but away at a distance from each other,"" Murphy says.
Is that true?
We reached out to Murphy but didn’t receive a response. So we did our own research.
As it turns out, PolitiFact has already reported on a variation of this claim. Sunlight has not been proven to kill the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.
A common theory
This is one of many unverified claims about the novel coronavirus.
At first, the reasoning might make sense. There is, in fact, some evidence that viruses don’t like heat.

""The droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,"" Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, recently told Time Magazine. 
But, at this point, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control isn’t sure the sun or heat will affect COVID-19 the same way. CDC physician and researcher Nancy Messionnier said on Feb. 12 that ""it’s premature to assume"" the heat and sunlight will temper the virus. ""We haven’t been through even a single year with this pathogen,"" she told NPR.
Sun exposure can also raise a person’s vitamin D levels, potentially reducing the incidence of acute respiratory infection, Harvard University professor Marc Lipsitch wrote in his recent paper: ""Seasonality of SARS-CoV-2: Will COVID-19 go away on its own in warmer weather?""
But, Lipsitch wrote, ""On the other hand, we found that this effect was unlikely to be a large factor in the variation in influenza incidence between summer and winter.""
Neither the World Health Organization nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control list sunlight exposure as a method for preventing the coronavirus. In fact, on its ""mythbusters"" webpage, the WHO says COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, ""including areas with hot and humid weather.""
Natural UV light not enough
One reason people might believe sunlight can kill the virus is because sunlight contains ultraviolet light. In Rep. Murphy’s video, he stands next to a white board that mentions UV light from the sun. 
High-intensity UV light can indeed kill viruses. But natural sunlight doesn’t provide the UV light intensity needed to kill the virus, according to Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health.
""Exposing surfaces to plain sunlight should not be considered sanitation,"" she said, adding: ""I would never ever, ever rely on sunlight to kill coronavirus.""
Graham’s claim about UV light is supported by Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 
To kill a virus, temperatures must rise to about 140 degrees fahrenheit, Bloomfield told the BBC. 
Our ruling
Murphy said ""sunlight actually can kill the virus."" This claim has not been proven true.
His whiteboard mentioned UV light in sunlight. But experts claim the UV rays in sunlight aren’t intense enough to COVID-19.
We found no conclusive evidence that someone could prevent the virus by exposing themselves to the sun for long periods of time.

Tommy Tuberville","Senate hopeful Tommy Tuberville fumbles the facts about COVID-19 and football




If Your Time is short





It’s not governors but collegiate athletic conferences and universities themselves that are deciding whether their teams play football this fall. 


Colleges in a given state can belong to different conferences — so, some might be in conferences that have canceled football, while others are in conferences that have not. 


Only 17 states with teams in the top tier of college football have none of those teams playing this fall. That includes 13 states with Democratic governors and four with GOP governors.





See the sources for this fact-check




College football has become a political football in one of the most competitive U.S. Senate races, with the Republican challenger in Alabama claiming that partisanship explains why the fall season will be played in some states, but not others.
Tommy Tuberville, a former college football coach who had his greatest success at Auburn University in Alabama, is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in the Nov. 3 election.
""It’s embarrassing that even two months before the first game, you have a lot of these states deciding, oh, we’re not going to play football,"" Tuberville said Aug. 17 on Fox Business. Then he made a statistical claim.
""Let me give you this one stat: 26 of the states that have governors that are Republican, 25 have decided to play football,"" he said. ""Twenty-four states that are Democrats, three-fourths have decided not to play already and most will probably not play. So, politics involved? Yes.""
Tuberville’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back his claim. But he gets a few things wrong.
It’s not states or their governors that are deciding whether college football will be played this fall. It’s the colleges or the athletic conferences that they belong to, each of which spans multiple states. And Tuberville’s figures are off, too.
A pivotal Senate race
The Alabama race could help determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. As of Aug. 17, the race was rated as ""lean Republican"" by the Cook Political Report.
Jones won a special election in December 2017 for the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions, who became President Donald Trump’s first attorney general.
After Sessions was forced out by Trump in November 2018, he decided to run again for the seat he had held for 20 years. He lost the July primary to Tuberville, who is making his first run for public office.
Decisions made by conferences, not governors
In big-time college football, the kind Tuberville coached in, there are 10 conferences in what is known as the Football Bowl Subdivision, which is considered the most competitive tier.  FBS, formerly known as Division I-A, encompasses more than 100 teams, from big-time programs like Alabama and Ohio State to less prominent ones such as Coastal Carolina in South Carolina and Old Dominion in Virginia. A handful of FBS schools play as independents, unaffiliated with a conference for football.
Four of the FBS conferences — the Big Ten, the Pac-12, the Mid-American and the Mountain West — announced in August they will postpone all fall sports for 2020 because of the coronavirus. 
None of the announcements referred to orders by governors, although some governors have issued orders affecting outdoor gatherings. For example, before the Big Ten canceled fall sports, member school Rutgers University in New Jersey said it would abide by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s order limiting outdoor gatherings to 500 people (Rutgers had a major COVID-19 outbreak among its football players.) 
In South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster has warned that he will not lift an executive order that bans large gatherings, such as spectator sports and concerts, until the COVID-19 situation improves. No South Carolina colleges play in the four FBS conferences that have canceled fall football.
Old Dominion (Conference USA) and the University of Connecticut, which left the American Athletic Conference in July to become an independent in football, have unilaterally canceled their fall football seasons.

The decision by the Big Ten led one of its star football players, Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, to launch a ""We Want to Play"" online petition on Aug. 16. It gained more than 200,000 signatures on its first day.
Tuberville was specifically asked in the Fox Business interview whether Fields’ petition has a chance to succeed. That’s when he responded with his claim about the governors. 
The petition, however, is directed not at governors, but at the Big Ten commissioner and the athletic directors and university presidents of the conference’s member schools. 
Conferences overlap state boundaries
The other six FBS conferences — SEC, Big 12, Atlantic Coast, American Athletic, Sun Belt and Conference USA — still plan to play football this fall.
So as things now stand, in Ohio, which has a Republican governor, Ohio State won’t play; neither will six Ohio teams in the Mid-American Conference. But college football is still scheduled to be played at the University of Cincinnati, for example, which is in the American Athletic Conference. 
There are other examples:


Pennsylvania, Democratic governor: Penn State (Big Ten) won’t play, but Temple (American Athletic) and Pitt (ACC) will. 


Maryland, Republican governor: The University of Maryland (Big Ten) won’t play, but Navy (American Athletic) will.


Iowa (Republican governor): University of Iowa (Big Ten) won’t play; Iowa State (Big 12) will.


Finally, Tuberville’s numbers don’t add up.
Based on a tally by Sporting News and a map by Stadium Network, there are only 17 states that don’t have at least one FBS team scheduled to play football this fall.
Thirteen of them have Democratic governors: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.
Four have Republican governors: Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska and Wyoming.
Our ruling
Tuberville said that amid COVID-19, 25 of the 26 Republican governors ""have decided to play football,"" but ""three-fourths"" of the 24 Democratic governors ""have decided not to play already and most will probably not play.""
Collegiate athletic conferences and some universities — not governors or states — are deciding whether their teams will play football this fall. Tuberville’s figures are also wrong.

Rush Limbaugh","Fact-checking Rush Limbaugh’s misleading claim that the new coronavirus is “the common cold”




If Your Time is short





The 2019 coronavirus is part of a family of viruses that produce illnesses ranging from the common cold to more critical diseases such as SARS or MERS. 


The 2019 coronavirus is a new virus that had not been previously identified. 


Most cases of the 2019 coronavirus have been mild, but it’s been lethal for some people.





See the sources for this fact-check




Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh accused the media of overhyping the 2019 coronavirus that’s infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide, calling it ""the common cold"" and claiming, without evidence, that it’s ""being weaponized"" as an attack on President Donald Trump.
""It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,"" Limbaugh said Feb. 24 on his radio show. ""Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus … I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.""
""The drive-by media hype up this thing as a pandemic,"" Limbaugh continued. ""Ninety-eight percent of people who get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus.""

The recent Presidential Medal of Freedom winner went on to push the debunked conspiracy theory that the new coronavirus strain was created in a lab as a bioweapon. But we were also struck by his claim that the 2019 coronavirus is nothing more than ""the common cold."" 
We didn’t have to look far to see where Limbaugh went wrong. In a FAQ about the 2019 coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed his confusion head-on.
""A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified,"" the CDC wrote. ""The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not that same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.""
The 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain of coronavirus
The current strain of coronavirus was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. It’s one of seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the CDC.
Named for the crown-like spikes on their surface, coronaviruses are typically found in animals such as camels, cattle and bats. Strains infecting humans were discovered in the mid 1960s.
RELATED: PolitiFact’s coronavirus coverage in one place
Most strains that affect humans are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003.
According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012. 
All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath — similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization.
A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.""
But the same fact-sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said.

What Limbaugh got wrong
Limbaugh seems to have been ""mixing up clinical symptoms as defining the disease,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.
""Many diseases start off with ‘flu-like symptoms’ and progress on to something else,"" Watanabe said, noting that the 2019 coronavirus is part of a different family of viruses than the flu.
RELATED: A reader’s guide to misinformation about the coronavirus
Neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said on air that Limbaugh’s comparison was ""minimizing"" what the 2019 coronavirus could become.
""This is a brand new virus,"" he said. ""I think what Rush Limbaugh is referring to is the idea that it is from a family of coronaviruses. That is the family name of these viruses, and some of them in the past have caused systems that were more consistent with the common cold. But it’s also been the same family of viruses that caused SARS, that caused MERS.""
Experts from the National Institutes of Health and Penn State University’s College of Medicine drew a line from the spread of the 2019 virus to outbreaks of SARS and MERS in a report titled ""Coronavirus Infections — More Than Just the Common Cold.""
According to the WHO, about 80% of 2019 coronavirus patients have recovered from mild symptoms without needing special treatment, while roughly 1 in every 6 people have become ""seriously ill."" About 2% of people have died. (For comparison, the flu — which is more severe than the common cold — has an estimated death rate in the United States of about 0.1%).

Generally speaking, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that produce illnesses ranging from the common cold to more critical diseases such as SARS or MERS. 
But the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold.

John James","John James levels misleading attack on Sen. Gary Peters’ coronavirus response




If Your Time is short





Sen. Gary Peters’ assessment of the coronavirus in mid-February squared with what top public health experts and officials were saying at the time. 


Peters took a number of steps to strengthen the federal government’s response to the coronavirus. 





See the sources for this fact-check




A new TV ad from Senate Republican candidate John James attacks incumbent Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., over his response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The ad features an elderly patient lying on a hospital bed. Over the sound of a beeping ventilator, the ad’s narrator issues a long list of accusations against Peters: ""He ignored all the warning signs. He downplayed the pandemic. … He failed to lead. Gary Peters leads the committee charged with pandemic response but Peters skipped hearings, blew off reports, downplayed risks.""
The ad features a short clip from a Fox News interview on Feb. 12 in which Peters said, ""We think the risk right now to the United States is very low.""
The ad comes amid a running political battle over the government’s coronavirus response, with some Democrats accusing Republicans and the Trump administration of downplaying the threat posed by the virus, and Republicans accusing Democrats of hyping the threat to undermine the president ahead of the election.
Trump himself has consistently downplayed the virus in public and admitted in a recorded interview to doing so intentionally. Even after contracting the disease, Trump continued to minimize the risk posed by COVID-19.
In light of that, we found it curious that James has commended Trump for his response to the pandemic, while faulting Peters for downplaying the risk. We decided to take a closer look at his claims.
James is wrong to claim that Peters ""leads the committee charged with pandemic response."" Peters is in the Democratic minority in the Senate and serves as the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who recently tested positive for COVID-19 and opposes mask mandates.
James’ campaign cited one hearing and several reports related to pandemics. But we found that those reports came years before the current coronavirus pandemic and were aimed at executive branch officials.
Meanwhile, James’ ad leaves out some key facts about Peters’ response to the virus and actions he took well before the outbreak became a global pandemic.
When Peters said in mid-February that the virus posed a low risk to the U.S., his assessment aligned with what public health experts were saying at the time, and he joined them in warning that the virus needed to be monitored vigilantly.
The interview came several weeks before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on Mar. 11 and President Trump declared a national emergency on Mar. 13.
A timeline of Peters’ pandemic response
In an email promoting the ad, James’ campaign pointed to oversight and emergency management subcommittee hearings Peters missed in 2015 and 2016, years before the pandemic, to support its claim that Peters ""skipped hearings.""
James’ campaign similarly said Peters ""blew off reports,"" citing a number of reports issued before the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.
In 2015, his first year in the Senate, Peters attended a homeland security committee hearing on a Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense report calling on the federal government to better prepare for a future global pandemic. By 2020, most of the panel’s recommendations had not been implemented.

Other reports showed the federal government did not do enough to prepare for the coronavirus outbreak. These include a July 2016 memo submitted to then-National Security Adviser Susan Rice on lessons learned from the 2014 Ebola outbreak, an October 2016 audit of the Department of Homeland Security’s pandemic planning and a Health and Human Services report issued in October 2019 which found that the department was not ready to serve as the lead federal agency in response to an influenza pandemic.
Still, James’ campaign did not provide evidence to substantiate its claims that Peters ""blew off"" the reports or ""failed to act."" The hearing on pandemic preparedness James’ campaign pointed to was held in 2015, before Peters became ranking member of the committee. The bulk of the recommendations presented at that hearing were for the executive branch to implement.
What James’ ad doesn’t mention are the actions Peters took at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak to oversee and improve the government’s response, well before global health officials declared it a pandemic.
On Jan. 25, four days after the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the U.S., Peters claimed in a tweet that the virus posed a public health risk and security threat. ""This is something we have to watch very closely and I’m concerned about it,"" he said in an interview on CNN that day.
On Jan. 28, Peters wrote a letter with Johnson asking DHS to share its strategy for responding to the coronavirus. On Feb. 7, Peters, along with three other Democratic senators, wrote a letter to Mick Mulvaney, then director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, urging the Trump administration to fully fund pandemic preparedness and response efforts in its budget for the next fiscal year. The Trump administration had repeatedly proposed cuts to such programs in its previous budgets.
On Feb. 12, Peters helped convene a panel of public health and security experts to discuss whether the U.S. was prepared to confront a global coronavirus pandemic. ""I don’t think we’re alarmed at this point, but we need to be leaning in to what will the next step be if we can’t contain it,"" said panelist Julie Gerberding, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Peters echoed this point in his Fox News interview later that day when he said, ""We think the risk right now to the United States is very low, but we have to keep our eye on it.""
His assessment aligned with what public health experts were saying at the time, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Ten days after Peters’ interview, Fauci told CNN’s Michael Smerconish: ""At this particular moment, Michael, the risk is very low. But — and I have to underline ‘but’ — this could change and it could change rapidly.""
Peters also signed on to a Feb. 13 letter calling for the appointment of a senior global health security expert to coordinate the United States’ global health security work. After the head of global health security on the White House’s National Security Council was removed in May 2018, the Trump administration left the position vacant.
""As Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Gary Peters not only sounded the alarm long before the pandemic but has battled to get Michiganders the relief and resources they need throughout this crisis,"" Peters for Michigan Communications Director Vanessa Valdivia wrote in an email denouncing James’ ad.
Our ruling
James’ ad claims that Peters ""downplayed the pandemic"" and ""failed to act.""
That’s not accurate. Peters’ assessment in mid-February that the coronavirus posed a low risk to the U.S., but needed to be monitored carefully, squared with what public health experts were saying.
Starting Jan. 28 — a week after the first U.S. COVID-19 case was confirmed — Peters took a series of actions to press administration officials on their preparations to deal with a potential outbreak.

Hal Turner Radio Show","Far-right radio host Hal Turner promotes unproven coronavirus bioweapon conspiracy




If Your Time is short





There is no evidence that the Chinese military developed the 2019 coronavirus as a bioweapon.


There are dozens of viruses in a national database with genetic material similar to the coronavirus.


Officials are still working to determine the source of the outbreak.





See the sources for this fact-check




A far-right radio host who has supported the rhetoric of white supremacy is spreading misinformation about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.
In an article published Feb. 1, the Hal Turner Radio Show wrote that the 2019 coronavirus is ""a military bioweapon developed by China’s army"" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. As evidence, it points to two screenshots from a national database of genetic material.
""Somehow, it got out. The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result,"" the article reads. ""The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below. The evidence is irrefutable.""
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 2,000 times.

(Screenshot from Hal Turner Radio Show)
Since its December outbreak in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has spread rapidly around the world. According to the World Health Organization, more than 40,000 people have been infected in 24 countries. In China, 909 have died.
PolitiFact has fact-checked several conspiracy theories about the source of the coronavirus. Some hoaxes suggested that the virus somehow escaped from the Wuhan lab, which deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. 
We have found no evidence to back up those claims — and the Hal Turner article is similarly flawed.
Genetic material doesn’t prove conspiracy
The Hal Turner Radio Show claims that, because two coronavirus entries in a federal database have similar proteins, they are the same virus. That’s unproven.
Hal Turner uses internet and radio broadcasts to float conspiracy theories and hate speech. In 2010, he was sentenced to 33 months in prison for threatening three federal judges over their decision to uphold handgun bans in Chicago.
The Hal Turner article cites screenshots of two GenBank entries for coronavirus proteins. GenBank is a database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information that lists publicly available DNA sequences.
The first screenshot shows an entry for an envelope protein for a ""Bat SARS-like coronavirus"" that was submitted in 2018 by the Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjing Command. According to the Universal Protein Resource, an envelope protein is a membrane that ""forms the outermost layer"" of the complete, infective form of certain viruses.
The second screenshot is an entry for another envelope protein associated with the ""Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus."" It was submitted Jan. 5 by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Public Health at Fudan University.

RELATED: PolitiFact’s coronavirus coverage in one place
The Hal Turner Radio Show compared the two viral proteins using a NCBI search and found that the two were nearly identical.
But there are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans and they have similar envelope proteins. So the match doesn’t prove the two viruses are the same.
""The family of coronaviruses are going to be highly related, just because they are in the same family,"" said Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of California’s Keck School of Medicine, in an email.
We ran the same NCBI search as the Hal Turner Radio Show and found 78 entries with envelope proteins similar to the 2019 coronavirus.
Bioweapon theory is unfounded
The second claim in the Hal Turner Radio Show’s article is that, since Chinese researchers uploaded its genetic information, the 2019 coronavirus is a military bioweapon. That’s unproven.
There is a lab near Wuhan that deals with dangerous pathogens — and some have linked it to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the U.S. State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons.
Officials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus.
Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."" The disease appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to 24 countries. Researchers believe the current outbreak pattern suggests the coronavirus may have spread from animal to human at first, and now from human to human.
RELATED: No evidence that Chinese officials will say coronavirus was leaked from a lab
There’s no evidence that the coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon. And even if there were, Watanabe said it’s highly unlikely the Chinese military would have uploaded the genetic sequence to a public database maintained by an American government agency.
""China, like the other countries including the U.S., have legitimate biomedical research going on at military facilities,"" Watanabe said. ""Just because they uploaded information, doesn’t make it a bioweapon.""
Our ruling
The Hal Turner Radio Show claimed the coronavirus is ""a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army.""
As evidence, the website included two screenshots of coronavirus entries in a federal database of genetic material. The site claimed the two viruses are the same. But all human coronaviruses have similar genetic material, and just because the entries were uploaded by Chinese researchers doesn’t prove that the 2019 coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon.

Donald Trump","Trump wrong to claim U.S. is padding COVID-19 stats




If Your Time is short





Decisions on how to classify a given death are made by local doctors or coroners, but based on World Health Organization guidelines followed by the U.S. and nearly every other country.


Among death certificates that list COVID-19 as a factor, 92% call it the primary factor.


Hospitals do get 20% more money for Medicare patients (under a bill signed by Trump), but there’s no evidence that has spurred fraud.





See the sources for this fact-check





Speaking at one of his many recent Wisconsin rallies, President Donald Trump said skewed stats mean the COVID-19 pandemic is overblown.
The pandemic response under Trump has been a central issue of the presidential campaign, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden and an array of third-party groups hammering Trump in campaign ads for what he has — and hasn’t — done to address COVID-19.
Pushing back on this point in Waukesha on Oct. 24, 2020, Trump pointed to how the country is counting COVID-19 deaths and funding COVID-19 healthcare coverage.
""Some countries, they report differently. If somebody's sick with a heart problem, and they die of COVID, they say, ‘They died of a heart problem,’"" Trump said. ""If somebody's terminally ill with cancer (in the U.S.), and they have COVID, we report them (as a COVID death). And you know, doctors get more money and hospitals get more money. Think of this incentive. … Then you wonder, ‘Gee, I wonder why their cases are so low.’ (The U.S.) and their reporting systems are really not doing it right.""
Trump’s contention is that we are counting deaths we shouldn’t actually attribute to COVID-19. And his implication — by mentioning the cost — is that this is being done to financially benefit the healthcare industry.
This gets at a core question for many COVID-19 skeptics — whether the widely-publicized tallies are deaths from COVID-19 or with COVID-19.
Let’s dig in.
What counts as a COVID death?
Trump is right that a terminal cancer patient’s death could be counted as a COVID-19 death.
But experts say he’s wrong that there’s anything illogical about that. The decision how to report cause of death is made independently at the local level by a physician, medical examiner or coroner, then listed on each person’s death certificate.
The federal agency that oversees mortality data said what is listed as the ""underlying"" (i.e. primary) cause of death comes down to timing.
""If a terminal patient still had, say 6 months to live, but was infected by the virus and died, the certifier might determine that COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death because of the timing,"" Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, said in an email. ""In the same way, if that same terminal cancer patient was in a car accident and died from that trauma, the car accident would be the underlying cause. If, on the other hand, death from terminal cancer was imminent or COVID-19 symptoms were mild, COVID-19 might be viewed only as a contributing factor —not the underlying cause — or, if the patient was asymptomatic, it might not be viewed as a factor at all — and therefore, not reported on the death certificate.""
The approach to identifying an underlying cause is laid out by the World Health Organization, which  says a ""death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma)."" The Center for Health Statistics says this guidance is ""used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death.""
In other words, Trump is wrong about U.S. stats being skewed because other countries take a different approach. And his hypothetical about how other countries would classify a person with heart disease who died of COVID-19 is wrong as well.
Among the COVID-19 deaths tallied by the Center for Health Statistics (based on death certificates), COVID-19 was the underlying cause in 92% of them. So roughly speaking, that’s the group that medical professionals determined on an individual basis died from COVID. The remaining 8% are closer to the dying with COVID category — though listing COVID-19 at all means officials believe it played a role in that person dying at that point.
In short, this distinction between dying from COVID or with COVID isn’t nearly enough to alter the scale of the national pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans.
Understanding comorbidities
We should note minimizing COVID by attacking the death figures is hardly a new tactic from Trump.
Trump said in a Sept. 1, 2020 interview on Fox News, ""I saw a statistic come out the other day, talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interesting — that they died from other reasons.""
Trump was referring to CDC data listing comorbidities that went viral due to widespread misinterpretation. The report lists other medical issues people had when they died of COVID-19 — and noted that 94% of people who died of COVID also had another medical issue.

""Absent from the news — Dominion lost their lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell.""












By Tom Kertscher • June 1, 2021







RELATED: No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths
PolitiFact National rated Trump’s claim Pants on Fire  after detailing an array of expert input on the nature of this tally. Since Trump is applying similar logic in his latest claim, let’s review what experts told our fact-checkers at the time:
""The point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of them had nothing else but just COVID-19,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a Sept. 1 interview with ""Good Morning America."" ""That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn’t die of COVID-19 — they did.""
""The numbers that you’ve been hearing, the 180,000-plus deaths, are real deaths from COVID-19. Let there not be any confusion about that.""
So why do 94% of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also list other conditions?
When a coronavirus patient is admitted to the hospital, the virus is listed on their medical record. Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, perhaps they develop respiratory failure, which would also be listed on their record. Unfortunately, they die after going into cardiac arrest, so doctors take note of that, too.
All three of those conditions would be listed on the patient’s death certificate, but COVID-19 started the process.
""The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The financial angle
Lastly, let’s examine Trump’s claim that doctors and hospitals have an ""incentive"" to code a certain way because they get paid more.
It is true that hospitals get an extra 20% for Medicare patients being treated for COVID-19. This was part of a coronavirus relief bill Trump himself signed on March 27, 2020. Medicare (which covers about 40% of all hospital patients) provides a flat rate payment based on the patient’s diagnosis, and the CARES act included additional payment to address the complications and costs that typically accompany COVID-19 patients.
But Trump’s implication that something nefarious is connected to this is unsupported. We’ve seen no evidence health officials are misidentifying COVID patients for financial gain on any significant scale, and doing so for a Medicare patient would be prosecutable as fraud, experts say. 
A similar claim questioning whether COVID counts are inflated because of the financial incentive was rated Half True by PolitiFact National in April. The fact-check noted the additional payments are real but there is no evidence of numbers being padded a result.
To the contrary, researchers have noted the U.S. is likely undercounting COVID-19 deaths due to lack of testing, since the number of people dying nationwide in 2020 is well above normal rates. 
The CDC reported Oct. 23 that the U.S. has had 300,000 more deaths in 2020 than would be expected in a typical year, two-thirds of which can be attributed directly to COVID-19. Analyses by the Washington Post, Yale University and others said the remaining deaths are likely from two main sources: Deaths related to COVID-19 where COVID wasn’t listed on death certificates and ""deaths at home or in nursing homes from heart attacks, diabetes, strokes and Alzheimer’s disease, among people afraid to seek care in hospitals or unable to get it,"" the Post reported
Our ruling
Trump said at a Waukesha rally the U.S. is ""really not doing (COVID-19) reporting right"" because deaths are being improperly counted and hospitals have an ""incentive"" to pad stats.
This is wrong on every point.
The U.S. is following the same COVID-19 death reporting guidelines as nearly every other country, which come from the World Health Organization. Under those guidelines, someone with heart disease, cancer or any other disease whose death is hastened by COVID-19 would be listed as COVID-19 death.
And while COVID-19 patients do generate slightly higher payments to hospitals if they’re covered by Medicare — due to a bill Trump himself signed — there’s no evidence this has led to any widespread fraud or incorrect reporting as Trump implies.

Facebook posts","COVID-19 vaccines do not create the virus' variants




If Your Time is short





Several coronavirus variants emerged before the vaccines were rolled out in late 2020. The COVID-19 vaccines help reduce the spread of the virus, therefore decreasing the likelihood that it will mutate and create new variants. 


Slow vaccine uptake can cause more variants, since the virus continually looks to evolve and escape any immunity — natural or vaccine-induced. 


Public health experts say this doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t get vaccinated, but just the opposite, as faster uptake slows this from happening and will leave people better protected from the virus in the process.





See the sources for this fact-check




This is a new one.
Instead of the established understanding that vaccines help reduce the spread of COVID-19, and thereby decrease the likelihood that the virus will be able to mutate enough to create new variants, a new claim circulating online posits that it’s the vaccines that are creating the variants.
The claim comes from French virologist Luc Montagnier, a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in 2008 for discovering HIV. But Montagnier has been in the news since for sharing what some scientists characterize as pseudoscientific statements, most recently relating to misinformation about the coronavirus.
Montagnier makes the claim in a 2-minute video spreading on Facebook that’s spoken in French with English subtitles. It bears the watermark of the RAIR Foundation, which describes itself as a ""grassroots activist organization"" that’s working to ""combat the threats from Islamic supremacists, radical leftists and their allies.""
In the video, Montagnier calls the vaccination program for COVID-19 ""an unacceptable mistake"" because, according to him, ""it is the vaccination that is creating the variants."" 
He adds: ""For the China virus there are antibodies created by the vaccine. What does the virus do? Does it die or find another solution? The new variants are a production and result from the vaccination.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
First, it’s important to note that we found no evidence that this video is doctored.
Bethan John, a French speaker and social media journalist for the misinformation research organization First Draft, wrote up an analysis of the video and says the clip of Montagnier was posted on alternative video sharing platform Odysee by HOLD-UP Média, a group behind a viral French documentary-style video about the pandemic that’s been debunked by fact-checkers. 
John reported that the video’s misleading narrative that the vaccines create variants has been gaining traction in France for several weeks. Other First Draft researchers also found the video circulating in Spanish and Portugese and said the subtitles matched the claims Montagnier is seen making in the video, though there are a lot of sharp editing cuts throughout.
But while the video appears legitimate, what Montagnier said in it is not.
First, several of the variants that are circulating in the global population emerged before COVID-19 vaccines were widely available, like B.1.1.7, the variant that emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020. Second, the vaccines help reduce the spread of the virus, therefore decreasing the likelihood that it will mutate and create new variants. 
The video’s claim is a distortion of the factual premise that slow vaccine uptake in a population can lead to the development of variants.

Viruses try to create variants in order to escape immunity — but that’s any immunity — vaccine-induced or natural, which arises from being infected. 
The difference is that people who are vaccinated are better protected against such variants. 
""The virus is always going to try to evolve to promote its own survival,"" said Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the Immunology and Infectious Diseases department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""It doesn’t mean people shouldn’t get vaccinated. The virus is going to try to evolve to escape natural immunity, even if you choose not to get vaccinated.""
She added: ""Either people are going to get sick and get COVID-19, and the virus tries to escape that immune selection, or people can be vaccinated and the virus is going to try to escape that immune selection. Avoiding vaccination is not going to limit the evolution of the virus.""
Antibody-dependent enhancement
In the video, Montagnier also discusses a phenomenon called ""antibody-dependent enhancement"" as a concern with the COVID-19 vaccines. That’s a phenomenon that happens when antibodies produced by an infection or a vaccine bind to the viral pathogen, but don’t kill it. Sometimes called ""ADE,"" it can cause people with antibodies to have more severe symptoms should they end up getting infected later. 
But the video fails to mention that this has not been observed with COVID-19 or any of the vaccines that have been developed to prevent it.
ADE was initially a concern contemplated by scientists when they were creating COVID-19 vaccines. Animal studies were designed to specifically look for signs of ADE, and did not find any evidence of it. There has also been no sign of it happening in the real world rollout of the vaccines.
""With lots and lots of experience with use of antibodies therapeutically, we’ve seen no evidence of enhancement,"" Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s medical school, told the Associated Press in a related fact-check. ""We also worried about the possibility that people who were reinfected might have more severe infection, akin to the situation we’ve seen with dengue virus, and that also hasn’t been borne out. So there’s really no basis for the claim that’s being ascribed to Dr. Montagnier.""
Montagnier’s pseudoscience claims
Shortly after winning the Nobel Prize, Montagnier started to make headlines when he claimed that a ""good immune system"" was enough to protect people against AIDS. He has also become known for being anti-vaccination and pro-homeopathy and believes that ""water has memory,"" a theory that has been discredited by the scientific community.
In 2017, in response to Montagnier’s claims that vaccines are poisonous, over 100 academic scientists wrote an open letter that said, ""We, academics of medicine, cannot accept that one of our peers is using his Nobel Prize [status] to spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge,"" according to the French news website Connexion.
Our ruling
A video on Facebook shows French virologist Luc Montagnier claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines create the variants.
The COVID-19 vaccines help reduce the spread of the virus, decreasing the likelihood that it will mutate and create new variants. Several coronavirus variants emerged before the vaccines were rolled out in late 2020.
Slow vaccine uptake can cause more variants, since the virus continually looks to evolve and escape any immunity — natural or vaccine-induced.

Lincoln Project","Lincoln Project’s “Mourning in America” ad critical of Trump misleads on bailouts




If Your Time is short



• It’s wrong to say that coronavirus relief legislation didn’t support ordinary small businesses. The CARES Act included the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to support smaller employers.
• Among the loans made with the first $350 billion of the Paycheck Protection Program, three-quarters of those loans were made in the smallest loan size category, one that would support a business of roughly seven to 10 people. 
• In addition, singling out Trump for problems with how coronavirus relief efforts ignores that the efforts were also backed by virtually all congressional Democrats.



See the sources for this fact-check




A group called the Lincoln Project, headlined by several high-profile Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Donald Trump, recently released an ad that turned a famous re-election ad for President Ronald Reagan on its head.
The Reagan ad, ""Morning in America,"" is one of the most celebrated campaign ads in history. Using optimistic imagery and themes to argue that the country was on the right track after the crises of the 1970s, the ad set the tone for Reagan’s landslide reelection victory.
By contrast, the Lincoln Project’s ad, retitled ""Mourning in America,"" is replete with depressing footage of masked Americans and economic devastation. And it directly blames Trump for acting ineffectively on the health and economic fronts. 
At one point, the ad asserts, ""Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street.""
Trump tweeted his displeasure with the ad, ironically producing a banner fundraising day for the Lincoln Project. 
But is the ad’s claim about bailouts accurate?
While there have been high-profile examples of larger corporations being awarded loans from a primarily small-business lending program (and sometimes giving them back), this line in the ad is inaccurate. 
Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has been tracking the federal response to the coronavirus-driven economic downturn. He said the dichotomy in the ad is wrong.
The coronavirus relief legislation passed so far, Goldwein said, ""generally bails out everyone.""
Role of the CARES Act
We should start by noting that Trump wouldn’t be solely at fault for any design flaws in the primary law for coronavirus relief, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act.
The $2.2 trillion act, which Trump signed into law on March 27, 2020, included stimulus payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small businesses, and other relief measures. However, before it got to Trump’s desk, the bill had the support of both parties. It passed the Senate unanimously, and it passed the House overwhelmingly.
The primary way the bill helps small companies is through the Paycheck Protection Program.
Under that program, small businesses can take out federally backed loans through banks or credit unions to tide them through the coronavirus pandemic. The government will forgive the loans if the company keeps all of their employees on the payroll for eight weeks, and as long as the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities.
The Paycheck Protection Program attracted negative media attention when some larger employers, such as Shake Shack, secured small business loans. Criticism grew as the program ran out of money allocated under the CARES Act. Congress later provided funds for additional loans.
The Shake Shack loan appears to have been legal, since the program allowed loans for businesses in the food services sector that have more than one physical location and employ less than 500 people per location. Still, the negative attention led some of these businesses, including Shake Shack, to voluntarily give back their loans.

 
What does the data show?
The Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, has produced some broad breakdowns of how the first $342 billion in loan money was spent.
For assessing the ad’s claim, the most problematic cut of the SBA data concerns the size of the loans made so far. 
The breakdown shows that slightly more than 74% of the individual loans granted were for $150,000 or less, totaling $58 billion. Because most companies apply for the maximum amount allowable, and because the loans are capped at 10 weeks of payroll costs, a loan of this size is consistent with a company that has roughly seven to 10 workers, Goldwein said. (Because the individual loan amounts in this category were small, the sum of all these loans was equal to only 17% of the total money spent.)
Further evidence that the loans are reaching smaller companies comes from a survey released May 5 by the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading small-business group.

“Fauci’s emails leaked.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







This survey found that 77% of the group’s small business-owner members have successfully submitted an application, and about 61% of those applicants had already received their loans. Others were still in process.
So contrary to what the ad argues, tens of billions of dollars are flowing to small businesses.

 
What about Wall Street?
The public’s aversion to rescuing Wall Street dates back to the Great Recession in 2008, which, unlike the coronavirus downturn, was sparked by a meltdown specifically of the financial sector. The first big bill to address it, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, was designed primarily to help ailing banks, credit markets, and other financial institutions. Another early action was to rescue the government-chartered home mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
This initial legislation bailed out the financial services sector, rather than economically stressed ordinary Americans. Since then, complaints about lawmakers favoring ""Wall Street"" have  persisted for more than a decade, from the Occupy Wall Street movement to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ insurgent presidential campaigns. As recently as a few months ago, Sanders, in his second presidential bid, was regularly assailing federal assistance to Wall Street firms.
The Paycheck Protection Program does not put any special emphasis on aiding financial firms, although most of the big ""Wall Street"" players would be too big to qualify. In addition, after the bill was passed, regulations were implemented to bar private equity firms from benefiting from the program.
If a financial company is small enough, from community banks or credit unions to insurance broker firms, it could qualify for a loan under the program. In fact, the SBA data shows that the ""finance and insurance"" sector received 2.39% of the dollars loaned under the program. 
Still, that’s well down the list of sectors being served by loans. The biggest recipients were companies in construction (13.12%), professional, scientific, and technical services (12.65%), manufacturing (11.96%), and health care and social assistance (11.65%). 
Another way banks and credit unions can benefit from the Paycheck Protection Program is by servicing the program’s loans to small businesses. 
When lenders make a loan under the program, the government pays them a fee. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the total administrative costs of the first $349 billion loan tranche was $7.6 billion. Much of that probably went to financial institutions, some of them big players of the kind critics have targeted. However, it’s worth noting that this was not a ""bailout"" but rather a fee for services rendered.
Probably the closest the relief legislation has come to a ""bailout"" of Wall Street comes from a separate part of the law, and its impact has been indirect.
The CARES Act provides the Federal Reserve with $454 billion in emergency lending authority. This is designed to provide liquidity to the financial system to aid eligible businesses, states and municipalities.
So while much of this aid will flow through banks, it was not created with bailing out Wall Street as its endpoint; Wall Street is being enlisted to aid a wide range of companies within the U.S. economy.
Of course, some of this support will be used to help bigger companies, and this has probably helped the stock market recover some of its initial losses from the pandemic, Goldwein said. In turn, a healthier stock market does help ""Wall Street."" But this is an indirect benefit.
The Lincoln Project did not get back to us with support for the claim; nor did the White House or the Trump campaign. (Editor's note: We received a response from the Lincoln Project after publication; their response is included after our ruling.) The Trump campaign issued a news release on May 6 that cited the 74% figure from the SBA as well as a tweet from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying that 1 million businesses with 10 or fewer employees received Paycheck Protection Program loans in the first round.
Our ruling
The Lincoln Project ad says, ""Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street.""
This is wrong on several levels. First, Trump doesn’t solely get the credit, or the blame, for anything in the CARES Act; it was supported by virtually all congressional Democrats as well.
The financial firms criticized for benefiting from the Great Recession bailouts do receive some ancillary benefits from the act, but the loan-accepting companies are the primary target of such largesse, not the banks.
The clearest problem with the claim is the notion in the ad that ""Main Street"" is not being aided. About three-quarters of the loans in the Paycheck Protection Program were made in the smallest loan size category, one that would support a business of roughly seven to 10 people.
We rate the statement False.
UPDATE: After publication, we received the following response from the Lincoln Project. Our key findings still stand, and the rating remains False. 
""We base that claim on the following Meriam Webster remarks about Wall St: 'In popular culture ""Wall Street"" stands in contrast to ""Main Street."" While Wall Street is used to describe the capital markets and the financial industry, Main Street is typically used to describe the larger economy in which the vast majority of people live and work.'



""Charlie Gasparino, the senior correspondent at Fox Business Network, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post, 'These measures will almost certainly benefit Wall Street and market speculation — even as their impact on Main Street will be slow to come.' He also wrote, 'Wall Street traders will make money, while Main Street businesses face economic conditions not seen since the Great Depression.' 
""Private equity, one of the largest sectors of the financial industry, is looking to cash in on COVID-19 relief money.  According to an article from Vanity Fair, 'Among those angling for a federal handout is one of the wealthiest sectors of the American economy: private equity. These firms not only have a record $1.5 trillion in cash on the sidelines, waiting to be invested, but their CEOs are among America’s richest executives.

Kellyanne Conway","Kellyanne Conway misleads on name for COVID-19, says it’s ‘not COVID-1’




If Your Time is short





Conway suggested that the World Health Organization should have been on top of the novel coronavirus earlier on because “this is COVID-19, not COVID-1.”


COVID-19 stands for “coronavirus disease 2019” — reflecting the year in which the disease was first identified.


Conway later said on Twitter that she knows why the disease is named as such.





See the sources for this fact-check




In a swipe at the World Health Organization, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway made a misleading claim about COVID-19, implying that the disease caused by the novel coronavirus was so named because it’s the latest in a string of similar coronaviruses. 
""Some of the scientists and doctors say there could be other strains later on, this could come back in the fall in a limited way,"" Conway said in an April 15 ""Fox & Friends"" interview. ""This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks. And so you would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that.""
""People should know the facts,"" she added.

The comment came one day after President Donald Trump announced his intention to halt U.S. funding to the WHO and review its handling of the virus. 
But the name of the disease doesn’t mean the WHO had 18 chances to learn about coronaviruses before the latest strain hit. 
COVID-19 is short for ""coronavirus disease 2019,"" a name that reflects the year in which the disease was first identified. The WHO announced the name on Feb. 11.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""CO"" stands for ""corona,"" ""VI"" stands for ""virus,"" and ""D"" stands for ""disease."" Before the WHO formalized a name for the disease, it was referred to as the ""2019 novel coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV.""
The virus itself, by contrast, is known as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" and abbreviated as ""SARS-CoV-2,"" according to the WHO. The CDC lists seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, some of which are relatively common.
Conway was clearer about the origins of ""COVID-19"" during a separate interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo roughly 30 minutes after her comment on ""Fox & Friends.""

A social media post by former Major League Baseball player Aubrey Huff appears to blame the deaths of two sports legends on the coronavirus vaccine.
Huff, who has made several social media posts questioning vaccines, made his claim the day after Hagler’s death. His March 14 Instagram post read:
""Hammering Hank Aaron...now Marvelous Marvin Hagler two legends dead after taking the #covid19 vaccine.""
The widely shared post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
There’s no evidence that either man’s death was related to COVID-19 vaccines.
Huff did not reply to our email.
Aaron’s death ruled natural
Aaron broke Babe Ruth’s home run record in 1974, and his 755 home runs ranks second behind the 762 hit by Barry Bonds, who broke Aaron’s record in 2007. 
Aaron died at age 86 on Jan. 22, 17 days after he chose to receive the COVID-19 vaccination publicly in hope that other Black people would get the shot. The Fulton County (Ga.) Medical Examiner’s office said Aaron’s death was not linked to the vaccine.

MarvelousMarvin.com, the boxer’s official website, said Hagler died of natural causes near his home.
One of Hagler’s children, James Hagler, told TMZ that his father was taken to a New Hampshire hospital on March 13 after experiencing trouble breathing and chest pains at home. That was several hours before he died, according to TMZ.
We contacted the New Hampshire Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to ask whether Hagler received a COVID-19 vaccine and what caused his death, and were referred to the state attorney general’s office. A spokeswoman said the medical examiner ""will accept jurisdiction for unexplained and non-natural deaths,"" but that Hagler’s death ""did not fall under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner.""
Rumors of Hagler’s death being related to a COVID-19 vaccine can be traced to one of his former rivals.

He’ll be just fine but we could use the positive energy and Prayer for his Full Recovery!""
After Hagler’s death, Hearns wrote on Instagram, according to The Daily Mail: ""Our love and respect to Marvin and his family, this is not an anti vaccine campaign.. it's outrageous to have that in mind during the passing of a King, Legend, Father, Husband and so much more.""
That post apparently has been deleted.

Donald Trump","Without evidence, Trump claims Biden sent him apology letter over China travel ban




If Your Time is short





The Biden campaign said an apology letter to Trump “never happened.” We found no public record of any letter of apology from Biden.


Biden’s deputy campaign manager declared Biden’s support for the China restrictions in a statement to CNN on April 3, a Friday. The statement was not an apology.


Biden has used the word “xenophobic” several times in reference to Trump and his actions, but never directly in reference to the ban Trump placed on travel from China.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump repeated the misleading claim that former Vice President Joe Biden called him xenophobic for banning travel from China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
Trump added a new wrinkle on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, claiming that Biden not only called the travel restrictions xenophobic, but also apologized for the remark ""with a letter on a Friday night.""
""Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing,"" Trump said during a May 3 virtual town hall with Fox News.
""He actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move,'"" Trump said later. ""It wasn’t well played by the press, but he said I made the right move.""

There may be a simple reason why the letter Trump described didn’t get media coverage: There is no evidence such a letter exists.
""Never happened,"" said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates.
Neither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to our requests for comment in time for publication, and Trump wasn’t asked to substantiate his claim during the town hall.  
We found no public record of any Friday-night letter of apology — or any letter of apology — from Biden on Twitter, Google or the Nexis news archive database.
Other political reporters and fact-checkers have reached the same conclusion.
On Jan. 31, the Trump administration announced temporary restrictions on travel into the U.S. for immigrants and non-immigrants who had recently been ""physically present"" in China, with exceptions made for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their family members. 
The move followed similar decisions from roughly 45 other countries and announcements from a number of airlines that they would be suspending flights between China and the U.S. while the outbreak ran its course. Trump has repeatedly touted the policy, crediting it with saving ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" during the Fox News town hall. 
Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, declared Biden’s support for the China restrictions months later in a statement to CNN on April 3, a Friday. CNN posted its story in the afternoon.

""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" Bedingfeld told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.""
But Biden never explicitly called the travel restrictions xenophobic, as Trump has claimed. 
At a campaign event on Jan. 31, the same day Trump announced the China travel restrictions, Biden cited Trump’s ""xenophobia"" but did not specifically mention the administration’s policy. He said that in a time of ""crisis with the coronavirus,"" the ""credibility of a president is most needed.""
""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science,"" he said.
The following day, Biden tweeted, ""We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.""

Biden used the word twice more in March. But one comment was in reference to Trump calling the coronavirus a ""foreign"" virus, and the second was not clearly in reference to the travel policy.
Bates, Biden’s spokesman, told us in March that Biden ""has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak.""
""This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions,"" he said.
An April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like the former vice president admitted to complimenting Trump for the China travel restrictions. But in its full context, the clip shows Biden was criticizing Trump for not acting with enough ""urgency.""
Our ruling
Trump said Biden called the ban on travel coming in from China ""xenophobic,"" and that ""he actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move.’""
We found no record of any letter or apology from Biden. Trump appears to be citing a campaign official’s statement to the media in support of Trump’s decision.

Coronavirus







Donald Trump","Trump wrongly blames Obama for limits on coronavirus testing




If Your Time is short





The “decision” Trump is talking about had its roots in a 2004 law, when George W. Bush was president.


The FDA’s policy pre-dated the Obama administration.


The Obama administration explored changing the policy, but never did.





See the sources for this fact-check




In remarks at the White House, President Donald Trump faulted his predecessor for making it harder for the government to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, or COVID-19.
""The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,"" Trump said. ""That was a decision we disagreed with. I don’t think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. But we’ve undone that decision.""
When reporters asked, the White House pointed to a February Food and Drug Administration policy that relaxed the rules on tests for coronavirus developed in labs. The change allowed labs to start using ""COVID-19 diagnostics"" while they are waiting for the FDA to approve their testing procedure. The FDA laid out specific steps for labs to follow to show that their method for spotting the virus held up under scrutiny.
The change applied only to labs that met the highest standard, those that are ""certified to perform high-complexity testing.""
The FDA’s policies here go back many years and fall under the umbrella of Emergency Use Authorization, a fast-track for deploying medical help when time was of the essence and waiting for the normal approval process made no sense.
Overall Emergency Use Authorization
The FDA has general guidance for using medical treatments that haven’t gone through the usual clearance process. Emergency Use Authorization dates back to 2004 during the administration of George W. Bush. 
As part of American counterterrorism policy, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act of 2004. It allowed the FDA to issue Emergency Use Authorizations so diagnostic tests and treatments could be shared faster during a health emergency. The law was extended in 2006 and reauthorized in 2013.
Basically, a lab or a drug maker could tell the FDA it had a promising approach, apply for an emergency authorization, and the FDA would move as quickly as possible to approve or disapprove the proposal.
The FDA has a lot of flexibility in how it oversees these emergency authorizations. It issues guidance, not to be confused with hard and fast regulations. The guidance from the FDA in 2007, before Obama took office, is very similar to the one in 2017 at the very end of the Obama administration.
Both stress the need for speed and encourage labs to start talking to the FDA as early as possible before they submit their application to reduce the turnaround time. The FDA lays out what it wants to see in an application, but in case a lab can’t provide that in ""a timely manner,"" the FDA ""will accept and evaluate the request for an EUA based on data in the form the sponsor is able to submit,"" according to the 2017 guidance.
""They could turn them around in a day or two, depending on how similar it was to an existing use,"" said Alta Charo, professor of law at the University of Wisconsin and an advisor to the FDA in the first two years of the Obama administration.
Laboratory Developed Tests
There’s a second, narrower track. It has to do with a subset of the Emergency Use Authorization that applies to what are called Laboratory Developed Tests. Those are tests used in individual labs, and the FDA policy has been that these tests ""should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA’s approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration."" 
But the FDA’s authority over those Laboratory Developed Tests was always in a legal gray zone.

""This was not legally binding,"" said University of Missouri law professor Erika Lietzan. ""The FDA never had clear jurisdiction, and the people working at the FDA never enforced the policy. The whole thing is just a recommendation.""
That is the policy the Trump administration modified. These labs need to apply, but they can start using their tests before they get the green light from the FDA.
""They could have rolled the policy back further,"" Lietzan said. ""They still want the labs to apply.""
There was no change in policy regarding these labs under the Obama administration.
""Trump’s statement on this has been puzzling,"" said Jeff Gibbs, an attorney who focuses on FDA law and represents many labs. ""FDA has had a long-standing policy of generally not regulating Laboratory Developed Tests, but reserved the right to regulate them under certain circumstances.""
Gibbs said that policy goes back to 1997, pre-dating the post-9/11 laws, and hasn’t changed since. In 2006, the FDA issued guidance for emergency humanitarian use of diagnostic tests. It offered conditional approval for up to one year.
The Obama administration followed that policy, but in 2010, it signaled that it wanted to affirm the FDA’s authority.
The FDA began a long process of adding new guidelines for these labs. It offered a draft version in 2014, but in November 2016, it said the effort had ended, and the new guidelines never took effect.
There was no change of policy under Obama.
We reached out to the White House and did not hear back.
Our ruling
Trump said the Obama administration made a decision that ""turned out to be very bad"" for detecting the COVID-19 virus.
The White House pointed to a new FDA policy that made it easier for labs to use their own methods to detect the COVID-19 virus. But the FDA never had firm legal authority over those labs. 
The new policy still asks labs to apply for Emergency Use Authorization. The shift is that once they apply, they can get to work before getting the nod from the FDA.
The policy that had been in place had its roots in guidance that dates to at least 2007, and before that, to a 2004 law, before Obama took office.

Instagram posts","A social media post using old Fauci email falsely claims that Fauci ‘lied’ about mask wearing




If Your Time is short





The email from Fauci is from February 2020, when masks weren’t widely recommended to fight COVID-19. By April 2020, Fauci and other leading public health authorities recommended mask wearing. 





See the sources for this fact-check




A release of emails that Dr. Anthony Fauci sent during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak has triggered a new round of misleading posts on social media.
A widely shared Instagram post from June 2 reads ""Everyone was lied to."" It accompanies an image of a tweet that shows a Feb. 5, 2020, email authored by Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, along with this assessment by the author of the tweet:
""#Fauci says masks aren't needed unless you're sick and notes the #SARS_CoV_2 virus is so small it passes easily between #mask fibers. #Fauciemails""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The email cited in the post was from early in the outbreak, before it was declared a pandemic, when the expert consensus on mask wearing was much different than it is today. Within two months, Fauci and other public health authorities were recommending mask wearing.
The emails
The Washington Post on June 1 published a news article based on 866 pages of Fauci’s emails from March and April 2020 that the newspaper said it obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act request. The same day, BuzzFeed News published a news story it said was based on 3,200 pages of Fauci’s emails from January to June 2020 that it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
The Instagram post included a screenshot of an email posted by BuzzFeed News that Fauci sent Feb. 5, 2020, in response to questions from Sylvia Burwell. Newsweek reported that Burwell is the same woman who was health and human services secretary under President Barack Obama.
Fauci wrote: ""Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection. The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through material. It might, however, provide some slight benefit in keep out gross droplets if someone coughs or sneezes on you. I do not recommend that you wear a mask, particularly since you are going to a very low risk location. Your instincts are correct, money is best spent on medical countermeasures such as diagnostics and vaccines.""
What was happening then
It’s important to remember the time frame around when Fauci sent the email. It was two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was announced in Washington state, on Jan. 21, 2020, and five weeks after China confirmed the existence of a new virus. The World Health Organization didn’t declare COVID-19 a pandemic until March 11.

“Fauci’s emails leaked.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







It’s also important to acknowledge that guidance on mask wearing changed over time.
Early in the coronavirus outbreak, guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people shouldn’t wear face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. ""This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected,"" the guidance stated. Mask-wearing was discouraged because officials said masks had little value in preventing the general public from contracting the disease.
That changed on April 3, 2020, when the CDC recommended wearing masks in public places where social distancing can be difficult. Officials at the time cited clearer findings that showed the virus could be transmitted by people who showed no symptoms.
Fauci also changed his guidance, and began recommending masks be worn. On the day the CDC announced its change, he said of mask wearing: ""If everybody does that, we’re each protecting each other."" 
Masks’ effectiveness
By mid-March 2021, with masks a part of daily life, PolitiFact found that the research was clear that masks work. They are most effective as ""source control,"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people. While masks cannot block some very tiny coronavirus particles that are in the air, multiple systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies have shown that masks reduce the spread of COVID-19.
The advice to wear masks remained in force, even for people who were vaccinated, until mid-May 2021. Amid widespread use of vaccines and falling case counts, federal health officials revised the guidance again, saying that ""fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing,"" except in places such as airports where required by government regulations.
Our ruling
A widely shared Instagram post said that an email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
The post cites an email Fauci sent Feb. 5, 2020, when the consensus among public health experts was for people generally not to wear masks unless they had symptoms of illness. At the time, researchers did not know that people without symptoms were spreading the virus. The guidance from Fauci and other experts changed in April 2020, as more evidence about the virus and its transmission emerged, and mask wearing was widely recommended.

Chain message","Chain message is wrong about the National Guard, military and a nationwide quarantine




If Your Time is short





There is no evidence that the federal government is set to announce a lockdown. White House officials have repeatedly said it’s not something they’re considering at this time.


The National Guard and the military have been dispatched to some areas of the country at the request of states.


The chain message misinterprets the Stafford Act, which activates FEMA and authorizes aid for state and local governments.





See the sources for this fact-check




In the past few days, several state and local governments have taken drastic action to try to contain the spread of the 2019 coronavirus. 
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced March 19 a statewide ""shelter in place"" order. On March 20, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all nonessential businesses to keep their employees home. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has ordered all restaurants to close except for takeout and delivery.
One popular chain message takes these measures a step further.
""Homeland security is preparing to mobilize the national guard. Preparing to dispatch them across the US with military,"" reads the message, which claims it was sent by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. ""They will also call in 1st responders. They are preparing to announce a nationwide 2 week quarantine for all citizens, All businesses closed.""

(Screenshot from iMessage)
A reader sent us the message on March 19. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted a screenshot of a very similar text on March 20.
""Here we go again with the ‘my friend whose dad works in the government’ rumors,"" he said.
We’ve seen several other chain messages that falsely claim the federal government is set to announce a nationwide quarantine to stem the spread of COVID-19. So we checked this one out, too.
The text contains kernels of truth, but its primary message is bogus. 
There is no evidence that the federal government is set to announce a lockdown like the ones seen in France, Italy and Spain. While the National Guard and the military have been dispatched to some areas of the country hard-hit by the coronavirus, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor FEMA have ordered them to. And the message misinterprets the Stafford Act, a federal disaster relief law that activates FEMA and sends aid to state and local governments.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he is not considering a nationwide quarantine or curfew. He first answered a question about it during a March 16 press conference and reiterated his point in another briefing the following day.
""It’s a very big step. It’s something we talk about, but we haven’t decided to do that,"" he said.
More recently, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned misinformation about lockdowns during a March 20 press conference.
""Just urge everyone as they’re seeing information — information that at one time suggested that somehow this virus emanated from the United States Army, information about lockdowns that are taking place — every American, indeed people all around the world, should ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong,"" he said.
RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic
One of the first places where officials did mandate a lockdown is New Rochelle, N.Y., where Cuomo ordered a one-mile containment zone on March 10. Large gathering spots were closed for 14 days and National Guard troops are delivering food to people at the request of the state.
In California, nonessential businesses — such as bars, dine-in restaurants and gyms — are closed as part of the statewide lockdown. The state has also asked the U.S. Navy for a hospital ship and two mobile hospitals to help treat COVID-19 patients.
State and local governments retain the power to quarantine Americans within their own borders. On the federal level, the Department of Homeland Security can screen and quarantine individuals reentering the U.S. from other countries. But forced quarantines are historically rare, and most infected people are allowed to self-quarantine.
As for the Stafford Act, Trump invoked the law March 13, thereby authorizing aid for state and local governments grappling with the coronavirus and waiving certain regulations that impede access to health care. The Stafford Act is commonly used during hurricanes and does not necessitate a nationwide lockdown.

Stacey Abrams","Stacey Abrams gets Georgia’s reopening COVID-19 trend upside down. Cases fell




If Your Time is short





Stacey Abrams said after reopening, Georgia’s COVID-19 rate went up 40%.


In fact, the number of cases fell 12% compared with the same period before reopening.


It will take more time before the impact of reopening shows up in the data.





See the sources for this fact-check




Stacey Abrams has often come up as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The Georgia Democrat nearly won the 2018 governor’s race. In an interview with Mother Jones, Abrams said if she were in the governor’s mansion today, she would have handled the COVID-19 crisis totally differently.
""I wouldn’t have led Georgia to be one of the last states to shut down, and we certainly wouldn’t have been one of the first to reopen,"" Abrams said in a May 7 interview. ""Since the reopening of the state, we’ve seen our COVID rate skyrocket by 40%.""
Abrams’ statistic is wrong.
Abrams spokesman Seth Bringman said she relied on a post that briefly appeared on Forbes.com. The post was withdrawn.
Virus testing in Georgia, drawn from the Covid Testing Project data, shows there was a smaller increase in the number of new cases in the period after Gov. Brian Kemp relaxed restrictions than in a similar period before the change.
Under Kemp, Georgia was one of the first states to reopen businesses.
Between April 24 and April 27, restaurants, gyms, beauty parlors and a number of other kinds of businesses began to welcome customers, so long as they followed rules to keep patrons separated and took other measures to prevent infection.
In the 12 days before April 24, when Kemp began easing restrictions, Georgia had a total of 9,695 confirmed coronavirus cases.
In the 12 days after (which coincides with Abrams’ interview), Georgia reported about 1,100 fewer confirmed cases, 8,549.
Overall, comparing the two time periods, cases in Georgia decreased 12% after the reopening. They didn’t increase 40%.

Bringman said no one has firm numbers in Georgia.
""The state is not producing accurate data, thus there is no way to know how many Georgians who have suffered,"" he said.
The state has had problems, particularly in tracking deaths at long-term care facilities.
But without good data, Abrams also wouldn’t have any basis to say cases rose 40%. 
When she spoke, it was way too early to know if relaxing the rules on business had caused the disease to spread.
It takes anywhere from three to 14 days for an infection to take hold. And after that, more days before a person feels ill enough to see a doctor, get tested and get test results back.
Boston University epidemiologist Eleanor Murray emphasized that the impact of reopening business life in Georgia won’t be clear for some time. 
""There could be up to a month or more delay between when a case is reported and when the infection was transmitted,"" Murray said. ""This makes it very difficult to say whether cases are from before or after opening, especially in the first few weeks.""
Our ruling
Abrams said that after Georgia’s governor reopened certain business activities, the COVID-19 rate rose 40%.
In reality, the period after reopening had 12% fewer cases. Even if the policy shift did cause infections to rise, it wouldn’t appear until several weeks later. Abrams spoke before that effect would show up in the data.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump misses key facts in claim that New York governor refused to buy ventilators in 2015




If Your Time is short





A 2015 New York state report said that in the case of a “severe” pandemic, the state would be short about 16,000 ventilators during the peak week. But the report did not recommend buying 16,000 ventilators, and did not indicate whether the state was at a fiscal position to purchase them.


The state did not plan to increase its ventilator stockpile because it anticipated that in the event of a severe crisis, there would be shortage of trained staff to operate them and demand would outweigh any emergency stockpile. 


The report said the state had to balance the likely ventilator shortage with the need for adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump didn’t like that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on TV that the federal government should provide the state stockpiled ventilators to help New Yorkers battling the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump said his administration was helping Cuomo, and Cuomo ""shouldn't be talking about us, he’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators.""
Trump used a moment in his Fox News town hall to say Cuomo had the chance a few years ago.
""Right here, I just got this out,"" Trump said March 24, shuffling through papers. ""This says New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic, for a pandemic, established death panels and lotteries instead. So, he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down. I’m not blaming him or anything else.""
New York is, as of March 25, the worst-hit spot in the United States, with more than 25,000 people diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Cuomo has repeatedly said New York needs thousands more ventilators and that the federal government should lend ventilators it has in its reserves.
PolitiFact wondered if Trump was right that Cuomo a few years ago rejected buying ventilators, and ""established death panels and lotteries instead.""
He’s not.

The White House did not reply to our requests for evidence backing Trump’s claim.
But Trump appeared to be reading, word-for-word, a March 22 headline on the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website. The website linked to a March 18 post on creators.com, by Betsy McCaughey, a Republican who served as lieutenant governor of New York in the 1990s.
McCaughey’s post said that Cuomo in 2015 ""could have chosen to buy more ventilators"" after learning that the state’s stockpile had 16,000 fewer ventilators than needed in case of a ""severe"" pandemic.
Instead, a task force drafted rules for rationing the ventilators they already had, McCaughey wrote. ""Patients assigned a red code will have the highest access, and other patients will be assigned green, yellow or blue (the worst) depending on a ‘triage officer's decision. In truth, a death officer. Let's not sugarcoat it. It won't be up to your own doctor,"" she wrote.
New York’s 2015 report on ventilator allocation
Cuomo, a Democrat, has been New York’s governor since 2011. New York’s health department in 2015, as part of its emergency preparedness plans, issued a report on ventilator allocation guidelines the state could follow if it had to deal with an influenza pandemic. It modeled data to examine scenarios under a ""moderate"" pandemic (1957 and 1968 flu pandemics characteristics) and a ""severe"" pandemic (similar to the 1918 pandemic).
A task force estimated that under a severe scenario, more than 800,000 people would be hospitalized, and during peak week demand, around 18,600 ventilators would be needed. During that peak week, the state would likely be short about 16,000 ventilators, the report said. (Under a moderate scenario, the state would have a surplus during the peak week.)
The state had ""no current plans"" to buy enough ventilators for the most severe scenario, the report said.
""The state’s current approach to stockpiling a limited number of ventilators balances the need to prepare for a potential pandemic against the need to maintain adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses,"" the report said.

Buying ventilators beyond a threshold would not save more lives because there wouldn’t be enough trained staff to operate them anyway, the report said. And if the health care system became overwhelmed, the state wouldn’t have enough ventilators despite an emergency stockpile.
The report does not indicate that the state had the funds to buy 16,000 additional ventilators ""at a very low price,"" as Trump said. It also does not say that the task force recommended to the governor buying 16,000, or that he turned down that suggestion.
Cuomo’s communications director told PolitiFact that Trump ""obviously didn’t read the document he’s citing.""
""This was a five-year-old advisory task force report, which never recommended the state procure ventilators — it merely referenced that New York wouldn't be equipped with enough ventilators for a 1918 flu pandemic. No one is, including Mr. Trump,"" said Cuomo spokesperson Dani Lever.
""Established death panels and lotteries instead""
The phrase ""death panels"" dates back to 2009, when former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin used it to argue against President Barack Obama’s healthcare proposal. She argued that the government would ration medical care and that the elderly and disabled would suffer under such a plan.
Trump and the Gateway Pundit article he appears to have quoted do not give a complete picture of the state’s findings. The state did acknowledge that in case of ventilator shortage, hospitals would need to make difficult decisions about what patients would get access to the available ventilators in order to save the most lives. It outlined protocols for adults, children, and infants less than 28 days old.
Top priority would be given to patients with the highest likelihood of survival with ventilator therapy. Lower priority would be patients with the highest likelihood of survival without medical intervention, and patients with the smallest likelihood of survival with medical intervention.
The report said hospitals had the option to designate a triage officer or triage committee to make these decisions. A patient’s attending physician would provide all clinical data to the officer or committee so that they could then determine the patient’s level of access to a ventilator.
The state in 2015 said that race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, advanced age, perceived quality of life, ability to pay, role in the community, or other subjective criteria would never be part of the evaluation in determining who receives ventilator therapy.
The task force also explored non-clinical approaches, including a lottery system that randomly allocated ventilators. But the report said those non-clinical approaches should not be used as the primary method because they could be subjective and/or not support the goal of saving the most lives.
The report also didn’t say its guidelines were final rules to follow. It said the guidelines were a ""living document, intended to be updated and revised"" based on new clinical information, societal norms, and feedback from clinicians and the public.
Our ruling
Trump said Cuomo ""rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic, for a pandemic, established death panels and lotteries instead. So, he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down.""

Joe Biden","Biden boasts about equitable senior COVID-19 vaccination rate by race without data to back it up




If Your Time is short




Biden has claimed multiple times that the Covid-19 vaccination rate for people 65 and older is equal between white people and people of color. But there is no available data that supports his claim.

 
Only select states track vaccination data based on both race/ethnicity and age, and most of that data shows disparities continue.

 
National data of all ages also indicates that white people are being vaccinated at higher rates than people of color.




See the sources for this fact-check




During May 3 remarks on the American Families Plan, President Joe Biden boasted that there was not much disparity in the Covid-19 vaccination rates for white Americans and Americans of color who are at least 65.
""And what’s happening now is all the talk about how people were not going to get shots, they were not going to be involved — look at what that was — we were told that was most likely to be among people over 65 years of age,"" said Biden. ""But now people over 65 years of age, over 80%, have now been vaccinated, and 66% fully vaccinated. And there’s virtually no difference between white, Black, Hispanic, Asian American.""
This isn’t the only time that Biden has made the claim.
He went even further on April 27 during remarks on the Covid-19 response: ""And, by the way, based on reported data, the proportion — the proportion of seniors who have been vaccinated is essentially equal between white and seniors of color. … As a matter of a fact, if I’m not mistaken, there are more Latinos and African American seniors that have been vaccinated, as a percentage, than white seniors.""
However, the national data that Biden keeps touting — vaccination statistics regarding both race and age — is not public. We asked the White House for the information underlying this claim, but officials did not provide specifics.
So, we moved on to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Spokesperson Chandra Zeikel told KHN-PolitiFact on May 6 that ""unfortunately, we don’t have available a data breakdown of both racial demographics and age together."" Zeikel didn’t respond to a follow-up question asking when or if the CDC would be publishing this data, but current CDC vaccination data is broken down only by race/ethnicity and shows significant differences, with white Americans far outpacing the percentage of other groups getting a shot. It also shows that the rate of vaccinations among some groups, including Black and Latino Americans, does not match their share of the population, though new CDC data shows there has been some progress on this front in the last two weeks.
Meanwhile, the CDC published a report May 11 based on the first 3.5 months of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program that described limited race/ethnicity data for those older than 65 who have received at least one vaccine dose. Although the data reflects some gains in vaccination equity, those rates do not hold across different ethnic and racial categories. In addition, about 40% of vaccine records were missing race and ethnicity data.
That made us wonder about the premise of Biden’s statement. We turned to experts for their take.
""As far as I know, there is no comprehensive publicly available data on vaccination rates by race/ethnicity and age,"" Samantha Artiga, vice president and director of the racial equity and health policy program at KFF, wrote in an email. ""As such, we are not able to assess whether there are racial disparities in vaccinations among people over 65 years of age.""
What about other state-level data or anecdotes that might support Biden’s claim? Let’s dive in and see.
A small number of states report both age and race together
At least seven states track vaccination based on a combination of age and race, according to Artiga: Michigan, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas, Minnesota, Washington and Vermont (Vermont tracks only two racial categories: non-Hispanic white and a combination of Black, Indigenous and people of color.)
The results from some of these states show that racial disparities do exist in the older age groups.
In Michigan, for instance, over 50% of non-Hispanic white people ages 65 to 74 had completed their vaccinations as of May 11. Other racial groups — non-Hispanic Black people; Asian American and Pacific Islanders; and Hispanics — all trailed by about 10 percentage points. The exception was the Native American and Alaska Natives category, which was within 4 percentage points of white people.
And as of May 11 in Kansas, the rate at which white people in that same age group were vaccinated was higher than the rates of Black people and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders.
In Vermont, for those 65 and up, about 79% of people of color had received at least one dose of the vaccine, compared with 85% of white people as of that date.
""With the exception of Vermont, which has the distinction of being the only state to target BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] populations by race explicitly, these are examples of states in which the numbers are not doing well in their equity efforts,"" Dayna Bowen Matthew, dean of the George Washington University Law School and an expert in racial disparities in health care, wrote in an email.

“Fauci’s emails leaked.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







Minnesota is one of the few states in which people of color are actually being vaccinated at higher rates than white people — with 93% of Asian/Pacific Islanders and 87.5% of Black/African Americans age 65 and over having received at least one shot, compared with 81.5% of white people as of May 11.
Some states are vaccinating similar percentages of their population of Black or Hispanic people, Matthew said, however that data does not distinguish by age group.
According to Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccination Racial Gap tracker, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon and Utah have vaccinated approximately the same percentage of Black Americans as are represented in each state’s population. Maine, Ohio, Alabama, Louisiana and Missouri have achieved similar population-based rates for the Hispanic population.
KFF provides weekly updates on national and state race/ethnicity data of those who have received vaccinations, which have consistently shown that Black and Hispanic people are receiving smaller shares of vaccinations compared with their shares of the total population, while white people are receiving a higher share. The May 5 weekly update, for instance, found that based on the 42 states that share race/ethnicity data, the percentage of white people who have received at least one Covid vaccine dose (39%) was roughly 1.5 times higher than the rates for Black (25%) and Hispanic people (27%). (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)
It’s also important to note that data on race and ethnicity information has not been gathered for many people who have been vaccinated. As of May 3, the CDC reported that race and ethnicity were known for only 55% of all people who had received at least one vaccine dose. And three states, Montana, New Hampshire and Wyoming, don’t report race/ethnicity data at all.
How to approach vaccine equity, experts say
Nneka Sederstrom, chief health equity officer at Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis, said that her state has done an ""excellent job"" vaccinating the 65-and-older population but that there’s still a lot of work to be done to reach communities of color.
We ""will need more direct tactics to reach"" those who haven’t yet been vaccinated, ""and help address any issues of hesitancy due to lack of knowledge or systemic barriers,"" Sederstrom wrote in an email.
Ensuring that vaccines are available at primary care providers is also important, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
""The truth of the matter is, the more vaccinators that we can get that are placed where people are every day, where it becomes a routine part of your life, such as going … into your doctor’s office for a regular visit, that’s a winner,"" said Benjamin.
But, Dr. Uché Blackstock, founder of Advancing Health Equity, an organization that advocates to end bias and racism in health care, said she would set the bar for vaccine equity success higher than just an equally proportionate share of a certain racial/ethnic population receiving their vaccine doses.
""What success in vaccine equity would look like would be if Black people or Hispanic people were overrepresented in terms of vaccine received since they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic,"" said Blackstock. So even though Biden quotes these statistics that lack data behind them, if the evidence did support them, it would still not be enough, she said.
In fact, the CDC does describe vaccine equity in those terms: ""preferential access and administration to those who have been most affected by Covid-19.""
Our ruling
Biden has repeatedly claimed that vaccination rates among white people and people of color age 65 and older are virtually the same — or even higher among people of color.
No public national data from the CDC or another database has been released to support this assertion.
For the few states that do report data on age and race/ethnicity combined, the numbers suggest that, for the most part, obvious disparities persist in the vaccination rates for white seniors and seniors of color. In several states, vaccine administration rates are more proportional to the percentage of the Black and Hispanic populations, but the data covers all age groups. National data for all age groups also shows that rates of vaccinations for Black and Hispanic people lag behind that of white people.
Existing data paints one story on vaccine equity, while Biden’s words paint another.
Without data to back it up, we rate Biden’s statement False.

Ron Paul","Ron Paul wrong to say no basis for coronavirus death rate




If Your Time is short





It’s not yet known what the death rate from the current coronavirus, COVID-19, will be.


But early data indicate it is more than 10 times higher than the death rate for the flu.





See the sources for this fact-check




For decades, Anthony Fauci has been held up as one of the federal government’s foremost public health experts. Even at age 79, he is one of the top advisers to President Donald Trump on the coronavirus crisis.
Yet Ron Paul, a sometimes conspiracy-minded Texas doctor, former GOP congressman and former presidential candidate, seemed to raise a fair question about a coronavirus statement made by Fauci.
Calling Fauci ""the chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration,"" Paul wrote in a column on his website that Fauci ""testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.""
We wondered about the scientific basis attack. In some contexts, public health experts have said it’s too early in the coronavirus outbreak to know exactly what it’s death rate is.
Paul’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""I can’t think of a more universally trusted person among virologists than"" Fauci, who has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, said Emily Bruce, an immunobiology faculty scientist at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont.
Fauci is taking the seasonal influenza death rate to be approximately 0.1% and the coronavirus to be about 1%, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. 
""While it is early in the outbreak, there is enough data to say that 1% is likely a fairly reasonable approximation with some scientific basis in data.""
While the numbers aren’t all precise, there is a basis for what Fauci said.

Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu. (Several factors apply, such as age and health.)


A study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China diagnosed as of Feb. 11, 2020, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found a fatality rate of 2.3%. A March 3, 2020, estimate from the World Health Organization put the figure at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals. Some people who die never report having had coronavirus.


The latest daily report on COVID-19 from the World Health Organization, issued March 16, 2020, said there have been 167,515 confirmed cases and 6,606 deaths. That’s a death rate of 3.9%.
The flu death rate is much lower.
In its latest weekly report on the 2019-20 flu, for the week ending March 7, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been 36 million flu illnesses and 22,000 deaths. That’s a rate of 0.06%.
The case fatality ratio — dividing reported deaths by reported cases — is only a snapshot and the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us.
""We will not have a clear CFR until the outbreak is over,"" WHO said in a statement, adding that the CFR can change if it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought, and can vary by country based demographic factors, such as age. 
We didn’t hear back from our requests for information from Paul.

Paul said that Anthony Fauci’s statement that the coronavirus death rate is 10 times that of the seasonal flu is ""a claim without any scientific basis.""
We won’t know for some time what the actual death rate is for people who contract the current coronavirus, COVID-19. But based on figures that are available, it’s indicated to be at least 10 times higher than the death rate from the flu. We rate Paul’s statement False.

Bloggers","Drinking chloroquine fish-tank cleaner won’t stop the coronavirus. It might kill you




If Your Time is short





Fish-tank cleaners containing chloroquine cannot be substituted for prescription drugs used to treat malaria.


A man in Arizona recently died, and his wife was hospitalized, after the couple ingested the fish-tank cleaner to avoid contracting the coronavirus. 


The FDA says you should not take chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a doctor and obtained from a legitimate source.





See the sources for this fact-check




An Arizona man is dead and his wife was hospitalized after the couple ingested a fish-tank solvent with chloroquine phosphate, the same active ingredient found in anti-malarial drugs that President Donald Trump has hailed as a possible treatment for the novel coronavirus.
The woman told NBC News that the couple thought the drug compound Trump mentioned in a televised press conference was the same as the fish-tank cleaner they had in their home pantry.
The two are not the same. Chloroquine, also known as chloroquine phosphate, is used in anti-malarial drugs available in the U.S. by prescription only, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A variant, hydroxychloroquine, is an arthritis medicine that can also prevent malaria. 
The husband and wife were not alone in their confusion. A number of headlines describing the fatal mishap, including from mainstream news outlets, did not make it clear that the couple ingested fish-tank cleaner, rather than the drug form of chloroquine. 
One headline published before the Arizona couple’s accident missed the distinction entirely.
""Fish tank additive may treat coronavirus,"" said a March 20 headline from Valley News Live, a local news network serving TV stations in North Dakota.
That headline is wrong. Fish-tank cleaners containing chloroquine phosphate are not the same as the prescription drugs used for malaria. Nor are they suitable for human consumption.
Moreover, as anti-viral drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown the ability to combat some diseases, but they have not yet been proven to disrupt COVID-19. 
RELATED: A 100% COVID-19 cure? No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal
Valley News Live did not respond to requests for comment by deadline.
What happened in Arizona
Officials from Banner Health, the Phoenix hospital system that treated the husband and wife, warned in a March 23 statement against self-medicating and said the couple’s case was a cautionary tale. The man who died was in his 60s, as is his wife, the statement said.
The woman later told NBC News that the solvent made her and her husband feel ""dizzy and hot."" She said she started vomiting and her husband developed respiratory problems.
 
She said that she had seen Trump talk in a press conference about the promise of chloroquine as a possible coronavirus cure, and that she had the fish-tank cleaner stored away.

But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said there had only been anecdotal evidence that the drugs could knock down COVID-19. The drugs are currently being studied and tested in clinical trials, according to the CDC.
According to the New York Times, prices for the fish-tank additive have skyrocketed on eBay as the coronavirus has continued to spread through the U.S. and around the world.
Don’t drink the fish cleaner
Drugs containing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not yet proven to prevent, treat or cure patients of the coronavirus, as we’ve noted.
A recent French study of 20 COVID-19 patients indicated that the prescription-drug version of chloroquine might help treat the disease. And the CDC notes that a study in China found that patients treated with chloroquine ""had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group.""
More study is still needed. ""There are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with COVID-19,"" the CDC says on its website.
But the fish-tank cleaner is a definite no-no. In a statement, the FDA said Americans should be wary of products that claim to prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19.
""Products marketed for veterinary use or ‘for research only,’ or otherwise not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety and should never be used,"" the FDA said. ""The FDA is aware that chloroquine is marketed as an unapproved drug to treat external parasites in aquarium fish, but these products have not been evaluated by FDA to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured, and adequately labeled.""
""Don’t take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed for you and obtained from legitimate sources,"" the agency said.
Our ruling
A Valley News Live headline said, ""Fish tank additive may treat coronavirus.""
Chloroquine, a compound commonly found in fish-tank cleaners, also forms the basis of a prescription drug used for malaria. There are studies underway to conclude whether that drug, and a variant called hydroxychloroquine, could combat the coronavirus.
But the fish-tank cleaner is not the same as the prescription drug, and it shouldn’t be substituted as such. A man in Arizona recently died from ingesting it.

Dan O'Donnell","No, absentee rejection rate in November was not a “stunning anomaly”




If Your Time is short





This claim uses flawed data analysis to assert there was something questionable or improper about the low number of ballots rejected in the November election.


November elections consistently have a lower ballot rejection rate since more voters use in-person early voting, which counts as an absentee ballot but is assisted by clerks to avoid errors that would cause ballot rejection.


The rejection rate has trended steadily down in November elections since 2008, and the 2020 election was in line with that trend.





See the sources for this fact-check




The November election has come under attack on a variety of fronts from a variety of sources. Former President Donald Trump and his backers have taken aim at voting machines, vote reporting, vote counting, the mail-in voting process and more.
Many of those claims centered around Wisconsin, a key swing state that backed Trump in 2016 but supported Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Election officials in the state have been unanimous that it was a free and fair election, with no evidence of fraud outside the usual scattered cases — and certainly no fraud that would have reversed Biden’s 20,000-vote margin of victory. Not to mention the recount that upheld the margin of victory.
Three months later, many remain unconvinced.
Conservative radio host Dan O’Donnell raised a new claim about election integrity in a Feb. 3, 2021, commentary piece written for the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank based in Madison.
In a piece headlined, ""Wisconsin’s Miraculous Vanishing Ballot Rejection Rate,"" O’Donnell asserted the low number of absentee ballots rejected in the November 2020 election was a ""stunning anomaly.""
He implied something questionable was at play.
""This is nearly impossible to explain,"" O’Donnell wrote. ""Did hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites suddenly figure out how to correctly fill out their ballots? Or was there a concerted effort to count as many ballots as possible without regard to whether they were correctly filled out? The evidence points toward the latter.""
O’Donnell’s core claim has two elements: That the rate of absentee rejection was an anomaly, and that the tally should be considered questionable — or even evidence of a conspiracy of some kind.
We took a closer look at both elements.
Absentee rate in line with historic trends
O’Donnell’s claim runs into immediate trouble when we look at the historic trend of absentee ballot rejections.
His commentary included a chart showing six elections since April 2016, with four having an absentee rejection rate above 1.4%, and the November 2018 and November 2020 elections having a rejection rate of 0.2%. O’Donnell described this as evidence ""ballots suddenly stopped getting rejected in the two statewide races in which unpopular Republicans (Scott Walker and Donald Trump) were on the ballot.""
But zooming out farther shows the November 2020 numbers were to be expected since November elections have consistently lower rejection rates for absentee ballots.

From 2008 to 2020, clerks rejected an average of 0.62% of absentee ballots in November elections, according to Wisconsin Elections Commission data. The August, April and February elections ranged from 1.4% to 2.2%.
In addition, the rejection rate in November elections has steadily dropped over time, decreasing every November but one from 2008 to 2020.
The outlier election was in November 2016, due to a change in state law. In 2016, the state Legislature passed a law stating an absentee ballot may not be counted if it is missing the address of a witness. Every absentee ballot in Wisconsin must be signed by both the voter and a witness, who must also provide an address.
As a result, the absentee rejection rate jumped from 0.31% in November 2014 to a 1.35% in November 2016.
But election officials had become concerned some voters wouldn’t be aware of the witness address requirement, so in October 2016 the commission — on a motion made and seconded by Republican members — voted to advise clerks they should fix missing address components based on ""reliable information."" This guidance passed very close to the November 2016 election, so it wasn’t followed widely enough quickly enough to affect the rejection spike in that election, WEC spokesman Reid Magney said. 
Once clerks had time to incorporate the new guidance, the November rate resumed its descent — to 0.23% in November 2018 and 0.2% in November 2020.
In other words, limiting the timeframe to 2016-20 as O’Donnell did treats the November 2016 number as a baseline and the November 2018 and 2020 numbers as outliers. Putting that data in context makes it clear 2016 is actually the outlier.
And, of course, November 2020 is in line with similar elections in the past.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Why the November dips?
That brings us to the question of why November elections — in 2020 and before — would have lower ballot rejection rates than other elections.
This is essentially the question O’Donnell’s raises throughout his column, but he never contacted state election officials to seek out the answer, Magney said. It turns out, it’s a pretty straightforward explanation.
The difference in ballot rejection rates is primarily because of how people vote. November elections bring a surge in early voting, which is still counted as absentee but takes place in a clerk’s office with the clerk as the witness.
""This eliminates chances that their ballot will be rejected for an insufficient (witness) certification,"" Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email.

Looking at 2016 to 2020, for example, elections commission data shows in-person absentee votes accounted for an average of 19% of all votes in November elections, but only 7.3% of the vote in the April elections — even with the spike in in-person early voting in April 2020 due to the pandemic. (We also checked elections further back to confirm this was an ongoing trend.)
For those using traditional mail-in ballots, Woodall-Vogg said Milwaukee elections ""cured"" — that is, used reliable information to fill out missing witness information, per commission guidance — a total of 1,063 ballots in November. That generally meant simply filling in ""Milwaukee, WI"" for voters who included a street address but forgot the city and state and could be confirmed as living there.
""We wouldn’t make presumptions about a witness’s address; if we couldn’t read the witness’ name or there were multiple people by the same name, we would either call the voter or return their ballot via mail,"" Woodall-Vogg said.
Why did the rejection rate continue the downward trend in November 2020 despite the high volume of mail-in absentee ballots?
Magney noted some improvement in rejection rate would be expected from April to November 2020 since in April many voters were casting a mail-in ballot for the first time and in a short timeframe, while in November they had more time to find witnesses and return ballots, and clerks had more time to send deficient ballots back to voters to be corrected. 
Woodall-Vogg also noted clerks around the state were taking steps to educate voters given the expected influx of absentee voting.
""Election administrators and community groups all made an intentional effort to educate voters on the requirements when voting by mail due to the increase with COVID,"" Woodall-Vogg said in her email. ""The WEC created new absentee instructions which were finally in plain English and even included photos. The media covered the requirements far more than ever before, as did we via outlets like Facebook and media interviews. On the exterior of our drop boxes, we had large stickers with STOP signs, asking voters to check if they signed, their witness signed, and their witness provided their address.""
Finally, Magney noted the rejection figures cited by O’Donnell are only one way to handle flawed absentee ballots, making it an imperfect measure of how many absentee ballots ultimately don’t count. If a ballot is to be thrown out, some clerks mark this as a rejected ballot, while others record it an ""administrative ballot cancellation."" While the number of absentee ballot rejections dropped from April to November of 2020, the number of administrative ballot cancellations nearly quadrupled.
""The assignment of these labels is entirely at the discretion of local clerks,"" Magney said in an email.
What a conspiracy would require
Before we move on to the ruling, let’s pause for a moment to take a wider view.
This is far from the first conspiracy claim involving the 2020 election. And it’s a reminder that a good first step when examining any claim of coordinated wrongdoing is to consider the scope. If there were something nefarious at play, who would have to be in on it?
The answer in this case stretches well into the quadruple digits.
Wisconsin’s elections are overseen by the Wisconsin Elections Commission, but we’re not talking about a generic policy in this case. The rejection rate is the accumulation of thousands of individual, local decisions on whether (and how) to reject a given ballot.
Those decisions are made by the 1,850 municipal clerks around the state, and the thousands more deputy clerks and volunteers they work with.
Asked if he was alleging a coordinated effort across a group of nearly 2,000 clerks, O’Donnell said, ""Clearly ballot mistakes that were accepted in these elections would not have been, and were pretty obviously not, accepted in other elections.""
Our ruling
O’Donnell asserted in an opinion piece that November election data shows a ""stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots.""
But that rejection rate was neither stunning nor an anomaly.
Election data from 2008 to 2020 shows November elections have consistently lower rejection rates than other elections, due primarily to the higher number of in-person early voting (which is included in absentee tallies). And the November rejection rates themselves have steadily dropped in each election aside from 2016, when a new law caused a one-year spike. The November 2018 and 2020 rejections rates were in line with that long-term trend.

""Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan,"" Trump said, referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a stay-at-home order and a number of other emergency measures in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Under her leadership, ""it's been like a prison,"" Trump claimed.
Trump has made similar claims this month. ""She keeps her state closed,"" he said of Whitmer during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Oct. 8. ""The churches are closed. The schools are closed, and the whole state is closed."" In a virtual rally two days later, he told Michigan supporters ""your governor has to open up her state.""
Trump’s comments seem to place Michigan residents and businesses under a lockdown. That’s not the case. Whitmer declared a state of emergency on March 10 as the state discovered its first two confirmed cases, and issued the stay-at home order and business restrictions on Mar. 23. But her order was lifted statewide by Jun. 1. 
Bars and restaurants across the state reopened shortly afterward, followed by barbershops, spas and salons in mid-June. Casinos in Detroit were allowed to reopen in early August. Schools across the state were allowed to resume in-person learning in the fall, with local districts setting their own criteria for reopening. And by early October, gyms, movie theaters and bowling alleys were cleared to reopen with safety precautions in place. Churches and houses of worship in Michigan were exempt from penalties under the state's order.
We reached out to the Trump campaign to explain his comments but didn't hear back.
Governor's order faced pushback
While many governors across the country issued stay-at-home orders at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, Whitmer’s was criticized as extreme or arbitrary. For instance, Michiganders were prohibited from traveling to vacation homes, and big-box stores were required to rope off areas selling nonessential items, such as paint and garden supplies.

On April 15, thousands of people participated in a protest outside the state Capitol in Lansing against Whitmer’s stay-at-home order, and drew support from Trump. On April 23, dozens of protesters gathered outside Whitmer’s Lansing residence. And a week later, armed protesters entered the Michigan Capitol.
Whitmer’s actions have also faced pushback from the GOP-controlled Legislature, which challenged her emergency powers in court. After the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Oct. 2 that she did not have the authority under state law to issue additional emergency declarations, her administration and the Legislature began working together to enact new laws to respond to the pandemic.
Public opinion polls have shown consistent support for Whitmer’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. 
But with the restrictions lifted, the number of COVID-19 cases in Michigan is now increasing in the vast majority of the state’s counties. On Oct. 21, Michigan reported an daily average of 1,704 new COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, the state’s highest seven-day average yet.
Our ruling
Trump claimed that ""it’s been like a prison"" in Michigan under Whitmer’s leadership during the coronavirus pandemic.
Whitmer implemented strict emergency measures in March, but they were mostly lifted across the state by June 1. All businesses and schools are allowed to be open.

Pennsylvania’s Worker Safety Order states that essential businesses must require that all customers ""wear masks while on premises, and deny entry to individuals not wearing masks, unless the business is providing medication, medical supplies, or food, in which case the business must provide alternative methods of pick-up or delivery of such goods.""
It also says that the measure doesn’t apply to individuals who cannot wear masks due to their medical condition, or to children under the age of 2 per CDC guidance.
""This is incorrect,"" said Nate Wardle, press secretary for Pennsylvania’s DOH. ""Stores and businesses that are not following guidance regarding wearing a mask are what are to be reported. Stores have the right, as defined in our Worker Safety Order, to refuse service to anyone not wearing a mask.""

If Your Time is short





Most of the numbers listed in the post are wrong.


Regardless, it’s too soon to compare the number of COVID-19 deaths to deaths from longer-running pandemics.





See the sources for this fact-check




A Facebook user suspecting a conspiracy suggests that despite global shutdowns to stem COVID-19 spread , this virus isn’t as deadly as four other historic outbreaks.
""In 1957, Asian flu killed 1 million people. In 1968, Hong Kong flu killed 1 to 4 million people. Swine flu caused 18,000 deaths, bird flu caused 75,000 deaths,"" the April 6, 2020, post says. ""All these viruses killed more people than coronavirus and yet they've never, ever shut anything down. So, what are the government not telling the public? Or, am I the only one confused by this?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
As for the number of deaths, the numbers in the Facebook post are correct with respect to one outbreak. All of the other numbers are largely inaccurate.
More importantly, it is too early to say what the final death toll will be for COVID-19. The pandemic is still raging and hasn’t run nearly as long as the other four outbreaks.
""The coronavirus pandemic has just begun,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""The numbers for the influenza pandemics are their complete impact over a full season and therefore not comparable to the numbers that have accrued thus far for the coronavirus pandemic.""
We’ll cite the outbreaks as they are referred to by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
H2N2 virus pandemic: 1957-1958
This new influenza A, known as the Asian flu, was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957 and in coastal cities in the United States in summer 1957, according to the CDC. 
Total estimated deaths: 1.1 million, roughly what the Facebook post claims, including 116,000 in the United States.
1968 pandemic (H3N2 virus) 
What the post calls the ""Hong Kong flu"" was an influenza A that is believed to have originated in Hong Kong and was first noted in the United States in September 1968, according to the CDC. 
Total estimated deaths, according to the CDC: 1 million, including 100,000 in the United States. 
The post claimed the figure was 1 million to 4 million, a range Britannica.com also uses. The encyclopedia doesn’t cite a source for that range. Other sources, including GlobalSecurity.org, refer to 1 million deaths or in the range of 750,000 to 1 million deaths (Medscape medical website, Nieman Foundation for Journalism).  
2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm09 virus)
The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world. The World Health Organization declared an end to the pandemic in August 2010, according to the CDC. It was originally referred to as ""swine flu"" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America.
Total estimated deaths: 151,700 to 575,400, far more than the 18,000 claimed in the post. An estimated 12,469 deaths occurred from April 2009 to April 2010 in the United States.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Avian flu
What the post refers to as ""bird flu"" was not a pandemic and is an outlier in this context. Says the CDC: Avian influenza A outbreaks occur in poultry from time to time, and some of those outbreaks have been associated with illness and death in people in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. ""While very rare, some avian influenza A viruses have also caused illness in people in North America."" 
The post claims 75,000 deaths from bird flu. But only 455 human deaths from avian influenza A (H5N1) were reported to the World Health Organization from 2003 to Jan. 20, 2020. None of the deaths were in the United States. 
Coronavirus (COVID-19), 2019-2020
The coronavirus surfaced in China in late December. According to the World Health Organization, there were 67,594 deaths, including 8,358 in the United States, as of April 6, 2020, the date of the Facebook post.
There were 1,210,956 confirmed cases globally as of that date, which creates a case fatality rate of 5.6%.
That’s up from a 3.4% rate cited by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director-general, at a news conference on the coronavirus on March 3, 2020.
So far, it’s dramatically higher than the case fatality rates for the three pandemics listed in the Facebook post, all of which were in a range of 0.5% or less, according to the New England Journal of Medicine and Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University.
But the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us. 
At this relatively early stage, estimating the case fatality rate is difficult for several reasons, according to an article The Lancet, a British medical journal:


The virus and its clinical course are new, and we still have little information about them. 


Health care capacity and capability factors, including the availability of health-care workers, resources, facilities, and preparedness, affect outcomes.


An unknown number of COVID-19 cases are uncounted, including people with the virus who don’t have symptoms, or people who are misdiagnosed.


Our ruling
A Facebook post that questions the lethality of COVID-19 cites specific figures in claiming that the Asian, Hong Kong, swine and bird flus each ""killed more people than coronavirus.""
The post is correct on the number of people killed only for the Asian flu. 
What the post calls the Asian, Hong Kong and swine flus each killed more people worldwide than COVID-19 has so far. But raw-number comparisons are meaningless, given that those pandemics each ran well over a year, and the COVID-19 outbreak is only four months old.

If Your Time is short




U.S. GDP declined by 9.5% in the second quarter this year relative to the same period in 2019, data show.
Two dozen other countries experienced a greater GDP decline over the same timeframe.
And while the rise in the U.S. unemployment rate showed the nation's economy suffered staggering losses, the jobless rate here was not several times worse than any other nation’s, nor did it increase at triple the rate of all other countries.




See the sources for this fact-check




Following last month’s Democratic National Convention, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said Democrats would better handle the coronavirus and the nation’s economy if they take control of the Senate next year.
""We have a worse economy than any other country in the world that’s going through COVID-19 by a factor of three,"" Durbin said on the ""Connected to Chicago"" podcast hosted by WLS-AM’s Bill Cameron.
While the U.S. economy has been struggling in the aftermath of shutdowns caused by the pandemic, the Aug. 23 claim drew a very stark comparison between the U.S. and the rest of the world that we had never heard. So we decided to check it out.
Asked repeatedly to provide records, studies or any other support to back up the claim, Durbin’s staff did not respond.
So we turned to experts and myriad data collected by economists to compare the U.S. economy to other countries. Experts we interviewed agreed the most effective measure is gross domestic product, or GDP.
""I don’t think it’s true that our economy is worse than any other country by a factor of three,"" said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University public policy professor who has studied the effects of COVID-19 on the economy.
One publication experts commonly use for such comparisons is Our World in Data, a nonprofit based at Oxford University, which compiles and republishes statistics collected worldwide.
On Sept. 1, Our World in Data published an examination of the health and economic impacts of the pandemic among 38 countries based on available GDP for the second quarter, which ended June 30. In it, the U.S. ranked above 24 other countries in a comparison to the same period in 2019.
Among the two dozen countries doing worse than the U.S were the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Canada and Mexico, according to the study. Peru experienced the worst economic decline at 30% for the second quarter. The U.S sustained a GDP decline of 9.5%, the report said.
Since Durbin made his claim about the U.S. having the worst economy during a discussion about unemployment, we decided to check that indicator to see whether the senator might have meant the U.S. jobless rate was three times worse than anywhere else in the world.

In June, Holzer published a report with the Brookings Institution examining how COVID-19 had affected health and employment in 25 wealthy nations. He found the increase in unemployment during the first months of the pandemic was larger in the U.S. than in any of the other countries he reviewed. From January to April, data in his report shows, the U.S. unemployment rate quadrupled to 14.7%.
That doesn’t mean the jobless rate here was several times worse than any other nation’s, or even increased at triple the rate of all other countries. For instance, Canada’s unemployment rate jumped to 13% in April, more than double where it stood in January. While the U.S. experienced a somewhat sharper increase, it was not worse by a factor of three, as Durbin stated.
We did find an assertion similar to Durbin’s made at the Democratic convention by former president Bill Clinton.
""Donald Trump says we’re leading the world,"" Clinton declared. ""Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple.""
PolitiFact found Clinton’s claim about the unemployment rate to be Mostly True. 
Holzer, who served under Clinton as chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, said if Durbin was attempting to repeat Clinton’s claim, ""he mangled it.""
Our ruling
Durbin said, ""We have a worse economy than any other country in the world that’s going through COVID-19 by a factor of three.""
As of August, when Durbin made his remarks, available data for the second quarter showed U.S. GDP declined by 9.5% relative to the same period last year, better than two dozen other countries around the world. And while other economic indicators such as unemployment rates showed the U.S. economy suffered staggering losses, they were not worse by a factor of three, according to published data and experts.
We rate Durbin’s claim False.

There is ample evidence that viruses, including human coronaviruses, don’t like heat. Influenza, for example, thrives in dry, cold weather, which is one reason the flu season typically spans from fall to spring. Viruses that cause the common cold also like colder weather.
RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself
In February, President Donald Trump said the coronavirus will ""go away in April"" due to the arrival of warmer weather. But some health experts have cast doubt on that prediction, saying there’s no guarantee the virus will cease infecting people in the summer. And if it does, that doesn’t mean the virus will be gone for good.
As of March 10, more than 113,000 people in 109 countries had been infected with the coronavirus. In the United States, there have been 938 confirmed cases and 31 deaths.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the best ways to prevent the 2019 coronavirus are to wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face, avoid close contact with sick people, cover your coughs and sneezes, and disinfect surfaces in your home daily. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus.

Sean Hannity","No, the Trump administration hasn’t fulfilled every state request for coronavirus supplies




If Your Time is short





Representatives from multiple states said they made requests for coronavirus tests or other critical supplies that the federal government has yet to fill or never filled.


Representatives from Oregon, North Carolina and Washington described difficulties scaling up testing and getting protective gear for frontline workers.


Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the chair of the National Governors Association, said “it’s obviously not the case” that governors have everything they need.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News host Sean Hannity touted President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response, praising him for ""huge decisions that save lives"" and claiming, without evidence, that ""this administration has fulfilled every request from every state governor.""
""There have been zero unfulfilled equipment and supply requests from state governors,"" Hannity said July 21.

Trump made a similar comment at a press briefing hours earlier, saying the nation’s governors get ""everything they need"" and his administration has ""zero unfilled requests.""
But Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the chair of the National Governors Association, has disputed such claims, saying during a press conference the next day that ""it’s obviously not the case"" that governors have everything they need.
""We had a call today with, I believe, 48 governors from across America,"" Hogan, a Republican, told reporters. ""There are still things that we really need.""
Hogan cited ""testing shortages"" as one area of concern. ""Not having supplies and running out of capacity across the country, it’s looking like it was back in March and April,"" he said, echoing the criticisms he made about the federal response in an op-ed headlined, ""Fighting alone.""

We’re not privy to private communications between governors and the White House. But we tried contacting all 50 states. Representatives from several told us they made requests for tests, personal protective equipment or other supplies that have yet to be filled — or were never filled.
Hannity’s claim that the administration has met ""every request"" overstates the administration’s supply of testing and equipment to states in what, from the beginning of the crisis, has been an absence of a coordinated national strategy. ""We’re not a shipping clerk,"" Trump said in March.
The White House and Fox News did not respond to our requests for comment.
More cases means more need for supplies
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, Health and Human Services Department and private sector delivered about 190 million N-95 respirators, 785 million masks, 33 million face shields, 342 million gowns and over 20 billion gloves as of July 17, a FEMA spokesperson said.
FEMA is still working with the governors. But amid soaring U.S. cases, news reports say some places are again experiencing long lines for tests, slow turnarounds for test results and shortages of personal protective gear. NBC News reported that internal documents show a dwindling federal stockpile of equipment.

""There has been some progress on PPE and other equipment, as well as testing, but not all states have everything they need,"" said James Nash, press secretary for the National Governors Association.
The governors spelled out priorities for the federal government in an April letter to Congress, calling for increased access to test kits and equipment and funding for contact tracing, social services, and small business loans, among other things.
Some requests have been completely or partially fulfilled, Nash said. Others, including a request for congressional funding to stabilize state budgets and a request for the administration to delay changes to hospital reporting requirements, remain outstanding. 
The Trump administration maintains that it is getting supplies where they’re needed. Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, the point person for coronavirus-related supplies, told the Washington Post in early July that he didn’t ""have the sense of there being severe shortages.""
""I’m not going to tell you we’re able to meet all demand, but there’s significantly less unfulfilled orders today than in April,"" Polowczyk said.

Several states have outstanding requests
About a dozen state officials responded to our queries about the federal government’s handling of requests. Taken together, their responses painted the picture of an administration that hasn’t been as attentive to some states as Hannity described. 
Three states led by Democratic governors — Oregon, North Carolina and Washington — were particularly critical of the administration’s response, especially on testing. 
""Woefully insufficient support from the federal government in terms of testing supplies has hampered our ability to expand Oregon’s testing capacity,"" said Charles Boyle, a spokesperson for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown.
When Oregon asked for more testing supplies, the federal government sent a list of vendors and ""suggested we call them on our own,"" said Robb Cowie, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority. 
Oregon is also waiting on 500,000 masks, 330,000 gowns and 300,000 gloves, Cowie said.
North Carolina has similarly sought to increase testing. State officials asked in mid July for more federal testing sites to be set up in addition to the 13 in operation, said Kelly Haight Connor, a spokesperson for the state department of health and human services.
The state provided a list of nearly 60 zip codes where more testing is needed, but only one new site was added by July 22, Connor said. North Carolina had also received 57% of the swabs and 50% of the preservation substance for transporting specimens that it requested for July.
""There are currently nationwide barriers to further scaling widespread testing,"" Connor said.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee requested in a June letter that the administration use the Defense Production Act to produce more personal protective equipment. 
Inslee spokesperson Mike Faulk called claims that governors have all they need ""misleading"" and cited data showing the federal government has provided just a fraction of the masks, respirators, gowns, gloves and ventilators that Washington has requested since late April.

""We are hearing from businesses and workers across Washington that they’re struggling to access PPE on the private market, are subject to price gouging, and being forced to use extreme conservation measures to stretch limited supplies over longer periods of time,"" Faulk said.
A handful of states are awaiting shipments or have orders under review. Maryland is waiting on a shipment date for a May order of 500,000 N-95 masks and 100 oxygen assemblies, said Charles Gischlar, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Health.
A spokesperson for the North Dakota Department of Health listed requests for masks, gloves, gowns, boot covers and other equipment that haven’t been completely filled. Idaho also has requests that are under review, but a spokesperson for the state’s emergency management agency praised FEMA for fulfilling all other requests for personal protective gear.
Some state representatives cited early problems but said the government has been responsive of late. Michael Pearlman, a spokesperson for Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, said the state didn’t receive as many rapid response tests early in the crisis as it had requested, but he added: ""I wouldn't say that Wyoming had specific requests that were not met.""
The Pennsylvania Department of Health said the state has received most of what it has needed, but not everything it has requested. Spokesperson Nate Wardle said the state asked for about 1,000 ventilators early on, for example, but that it did not receive any. 
""We were told that we would receive them if there ended up being a need, which there has not been,"" Wardle said. In April, Wardle and representatives from more than 30 other states told us they were not aware of any COVID-19 patients needing a ventilator and not getting one.
Representatives from other states — including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, and Ohio — said they have no outstanding requests. ""This administration has made things happen when we've asked,"" said Patrick Ptak, a spokesperson for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican.
ABC News and CNN also queried all 50 states for their own fact-checks of Trump’s claims about the governors’ coronavirus needs. Both outlets heard from different states but found Trump’s claims to be inaccurate.
Our ruling
Hannity said, ""This administration has fulfilled every request from every state governor.""
That’s an exaggeration of the administration’s efforts to help states navigate the pandemic. 
While some states said they have no requests outstanding, representatives from several others told us that they have requests they are waiting on or requests that were never filled. 
Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland and chair of the National Governors Association, said ""it’s obviously not the case"" that governors have everything they need.

Facebook posts","No, Gates didn’t say 80% getting Moderna vaccine had significant side effects




If Your Time is short





Gates was asked in July about 80% of the people in an early trial of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine reporting “systemic” side effects such as severe chills and fever.


Gates did not say that 80% of people who took that vaccine experienced significant side effects.


A U.S. Food and Drug Administration report in December said 0.5% of 15,184 people who received the Moderna vaccine experienced a “severe adverse event.”





See the sources for this fact-check




No, Bill Gates, one of the world’s leading proponents of COVID-19 vaccinations, did not say that 80% of the people who took the Moderna vaccine suffered significant side effects.
Nevertheless, this claim was widely shared on Facebook:
""80% of People Taking The #Maderna Vaccine Had Significant Side-Effectives Via #BillGates.""
The post, which relies on a misleading video clip from comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It’s not uncommon for some people receiving the two-dose Moderna regimen to report pain in the arm that received the shot, or feeling tired or sick for a day or so, particularly after the second dose.
But Gates did not say that 80% of people receiving the Moderna vaccine experience significant side effects. And reports of ""severe adverse events"" associated with the Moderna vaccine are extremely rare.
Post relies on video that misquotes Gates
The Facebook post includes video from a Rogan podcast in which Rogan recalls that Alex Jones, who runs a website that has published fake news and conspiracy theories, told him on a previous podcast that ""80% of the people that took the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, particularly after the second dose."" 
Rogan says that after he received pushback about Jones’ claim, ""I played the Bill Gates clip where Bill Gates is being interviewed by CBS and he says it himself."" 
But Gates didn’t say that in the excerpt that Rogan played. In fact, he didn’t say it at any point in the CBS interview.
Here’s that portion of CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell’s interview with Gates, which was done in July.
O’Donnell: ""You mentioned side effects. The side effects for the Moderna vaccine sound concerning. We looked. After the second dose, at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging from severe chills to fevers. So, are these vaccines safe?""
Gates: ""Well, the FDA, not being pressured, will look hard at that. The FDA is the gold standard of regulators and their current guidance on this, if they stick with that, is very, very appropriate. The side effects were not super-severe; that is, it didn’t cause permanent health problems. Moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose to get the antibodies. Some of the other vaccines are able to go with lower doses to get responses that are pretty high, including the"" Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. …
O’Donnell: ""But everybody with a high dose had a side effect.""
           Gates: ""Yeah, but some of that is not dramatic, where it’s just super-painful. But, yes, we need to make sure there’s not               severe side effects. The FDA, I think, will do a good job of that, despite the pressure.""

Video includes two other misleading clips
The post is also misleading in that its video includes two other misleading clips.
As Gates is heard speaking in the CBS interview, clips roll showing two women. No audio is played with those clips and no other description of them is given.
One shows a Tennessee nurse who became dizzy and was assisted to the ground after getting the Pfizer vaccine. She recovered and later said that she regularly feels dizzy after experiencing any kind of pain, even after stubbing a toe.
The other clip is of an Indiana woman seated in a hospital bed shaking. She had claimed in viral videos in January that she suffered from uncontrollable shaking after taking the first round of the Moderna vaccine. Doctors at a neuroscience hospital told the woman her problem was likely stress-related, her fiance told an Indiana newspaper.
Moderna’s side effects 
So, where might the 80% figure claimed in the post have originated?
In July, about a week before Gates’ CBS interview, the New England Journal of Medicine published a preliminary report on a trial involving 45 healthy adults who were given two doses of the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart. They were divided into three groups of 15, with each group receiving a different dose level.
In an article about that report, Wired magazine said: ""By the time they’d had two doses, every single one was showing signs of headaches, chills, or fatigue, and for at least 80%, this could have been enough to interfere with their normal activities.""
Moderna later submitted data from a large trial to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A December FDA report said that out of 15,184 people who received the vaccine, 82 had a serious adverse event, such as death, heart attack or pneumonia — fewer than 0.5%. 
That was the same level for the placebo group. There was no indication the vaccine caused any of the serious events.
The most commonly reported side effects of the Moderna vaccine, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever, according to the FDA. More people experienced those side effects after the second dose.
There is a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction, the FDA says.

Bloggers","Clarifying what’s accurate, and not, in claims about quarantines




If Your Time is short



• The CDC does have the power to isolate people with certain infectious diseases and quarantine those who had contact with an infected person. However, many of the details of this assertion are wrong.
• People can’t be quarantined for just having a fever; they have to be shown to have been exposed to one of a specific set of diseases. 
• Most quarantines are done voluntarily, not by force of the government. And vaccination is not a ticket out of quarantine. 
• Most quarantine decisions are up to states and localities, rather than the CDC.



See the sources for this fact-check




As the spread of coronavirus has fed fears of illness, it has also spurred fears of mass quarantines. And looking at other countries that have been hit hard by the virus, including China and Italy, it’s not an idle question.
On March 12, a reader sent us a comment from a website called Stop Mandatory Vaccination, run by a group that opposes bills to curb exemptions for vaccinations. (Here’s some background on the anti-vaccine movement.)
The website said in part, ""The CDC can detain anyone with a fever — indefinitely. … Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention.""
Similar comments on social media soon prompted high-level debunkings.
Late on March 15, the National Security Council took to Twitter to knock down rumors about a national quarantine: ""Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus.""
Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus— NSC (@WHNSC) March 16, 2020 
Quarantines are real, but there’s a lot of misinformation floating around about the details. Here, we’ll attempt to clarify what’s accurate, and what’s not, about quarantines. (An inquiry to Stop Mandatory Vaccination was not returned.)
What’s the definition of a quarantine?
There are two related terms that address this phenomenon: quarantine and isolation. ""Isolation"" separates people with a confirmed case of a communicable disease from people who are not sick. ""Quarantine"" separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.
The last federal quarantine prior to the coronavirus outbreak came in the early 1960s, when officials were concerned about a smallpox outbreak. It’s been a century — back to the 1918-19 ""Spanish flu"" pandemic — since large-scale isolations and quarantines were last enforced.
Federal quarantine power stems from Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries and between states. 
Federal regulations revised in 2017 allow the CDC ""to detain, medically examine, and release persons arriving into the United States and traveling between states who are suspected of carrying"" certain communicable diseases. (Here’s what a sample quarantine order looks like.) Those powers are carried out with help from other federal agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.
This federal government has exercised this power recently with travelers returning from locations where coronavirus has been spreading, based on presidential proclamations like this one.
Distinguishing between federal, local, and state roles
So far we’ve been referring to federal quarantines. But most quarantine power actually resides with state and local governments, as well as tribal law on tribal lands. 
That’s because federal quarantine powers are limited to persons entering the United States from elsewhere. By contrast, states and localities enforce those powers within their own borders
""CDC officials are ‘preparing as if (the new coronavirus) is the next pandemic,’ but in reality, the laboring oar falls to state and local health departments,"" Polly J. Price, a professor of law and global health at Emory University, has written in the Atlantic.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







So the assertion we’re checking in this article, by focusing on CDC, misses a lot of where the action is: state and local governments.
What redress does someone have if they’re ordered into quarantine?
Historically, forcible quarantines have been rare, and they require a court order. Most of the time, experts said, people who are infected are released on their own recognizance with a promise to self-quarantine.
There’s judicial precedent for quarantine powers dating back to the early 1800s, but subsequent case law has required a degree of due process, especially given that a quarantine, unlike an arrest, involves the detention of someone who is not suspected of a crime.
Past cases ""suggest that there are important limits on the ability of the U.S. and state and local governments when it comes to some types of public health action,"" said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University. The government has to show real harm, as well as that people get due process and a chance to appeal. 
Becoming subject to forcible quarantines isn’t just a question of having a particular germ; it also requires a strong likelihood that you will spread it to other people. ""Since most people can take precautions, this typically only happens in the case of person who can’t stay away from other people,"" such as people who have a severe mental illness, said Wendy K. Mariner, a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health.
What if you refuse a mandatory order? Practical consequences for such an action are tricky. While fines and incarceration are allowed, no public health expert today recommends jailing a person unwilling to quarantine, because they would be introducing a contagion into a confined population.
""The likelier answer is hospitals with secure wards,"" Mariner said.
Can a government detain anyone with a fever?
Not any fever gets you quarantined, contrary to the assertion we’re checking.
The government ""would have to have good evidence that the individual was exposed to COVID-19"" to impose a quarantine, said Lawrence O. Gostin, faculty director of Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.
""‘Fever’ is too broad a definition,"" Mariner agreed.
In addition to coronavirus, the CDC is able to quarantine only for the following diseases: cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS and pandemic flu.
Is quarantine ""indefinite"" detention by the government?
It’s an exaggeration to say quarantine is ""indefinite"" detention by the government, especially given what we know so far about the course of coronavirus disease.
First, as we noted, quarantine is usually self-regulated. And for those instances when it’s not, such as when an individual is uncooperative, the person is able to leave quarantine when they are no longer contagious.
Does getting a vaccination enable you to get out of quarantine?
Vaccination doesn’t get you out of quarantine. Typically, vaccinations aren’t cures; they’re preventive measures. In any case, it’s moot for coronavirus, because there is no vaccine yet.
Our ruling
Claims on the internet said ""the CDC can detain anyone with a fever — indefinitely. … Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention.""
The CDC does have the power to isolate people with certain infectious diseases and quarantine those who had contact with an infected person. But this claim is wrong or misleading about many of the details.
Most quarantine decisions will be up to states and localities, rather than the CDC.

Billboard","How are the CDC, North Carolina treating Type 1 diabetes in the vaccine rollout?




If Your Time is short




It's unclear who paid for the billboard and why, specifically, they commissioned it.
Knowingly or unknowingly, it touches on a controversial issue surrounding diabetics and the vaccine rollout.
Unlike other states, North Carolina does plan to vaccinate people with Type 1 diabetes ahead of the general population.




See the sources for this fact-check




A billboard in Johnston County suggests North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is shortchanging people with type 1 diabetes.
A WRAL viewer emailed a photo of the billboard on U.S. Highway 301 to PolitiFact. It says:
""Gov Roy Cooper does not consider Type 1 diabetes an under lying health issue! Think about that!""

The billboard does not show who paid for it. Warren Stancil, the president of the billboard company, InterState Outdoor Inc., said he doesn’t know the buyer’s identity.
""This was an anonymous person who bought the ad space. All I know is what’s in the message,"" Stancil said in an email. The ad went up around Jan. 22, he said.
Given the timing of the message in the midst of a vaccine rollout, we’re assuming for the purposes of this check that the messenger is likely referring to where diabetics fall in North Carolina’s inoculation schedule.
The billboard’s message touches on a controversial subject. To date, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not consider both types of diabetes to carry the same level of risk for COVID-19 complications. In North Carolina, meanwhile, the health department has grouped Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes together and people with either condition qualify for covid vaccines in Group 4, ahead of the general population.
Type 1 diabetes and COVID-19
The CDC’s webpage about how the virus affects people with medical conditions says people with Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk, while people with Type 1 diabetes ""might"" be at increased risk.
Under current CDC recommendations, people with Type 1 diabetes would be vaccinated with the general population.
Advocacy groups such as the American Diabetes Association and JDRF (formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) are lobbying the CDC to place higher priority on people with Type 1 diabetes. 
A study published in December found that Type 1 diabetes ""independently increases the adverse impacts of COVID-19,"" while another recent study found that Black COVID-19 patients were more likely to develop a serious complication of Type 1 diabetes than white patients.
Still, JDRF spokeswoman Cynthia Rice said that, as a result of the CDC’s recommendations, ""many states"" haven’t prioritized people with Type 1 diabetes. So the American Diabetes Association has been contacting governors and state agencies across the country, spokeswoman Daisy Diaz told PolitiFact.
Type 1 diabetes and North Carolina
In North Carolina, the health department currently considers both types of diabetes to be ""chronic conditions."" Where does that put diabetics in North Carolina’s vaccine rollout?
Let’s say someone has diabetes but isn’t over age 65, doesn’t work in an essential industry and doesn’t meet any other criteria for moving up North Carolina’s vaccine priority list.

That person would be in Group 4 of the state’s five groups:
Group 1: Healthcare workers, long-term care staff and residents
Group 2: Older adults
Group 3: Frontline essential workers
Group 4: Adults at increased risk of severe illness
Group 5: Everyone else
Asked about North Carolina’s plan, Rice said: ""That is the policy we are seeking around the country, with Type 1 included with other disease that increase risk of severe illness from COVID.""
Possible confusion
While people with both types of diabetes are prioritized in North Carolina, old versions of the health department’s website may have given people the wrong impression.
Take for example the department’s FAQ page about COVID-19 vaccines. Under the ""getting vaccinated"" section, the department lists chronic conditions that make someone a higher priority for vaccination.
The page currently lists both types of diabetes as chronic conditions.
However, according to an internet archive, the page excluded Type 1 diabetes from its list of chronic conditions as recently as Feb. 12. The webpage quoted CDC guidance, mentioning only Type 2 diabetes as a chronic condition.
That exclusion may be why some media outlets have mentioned only Type 2 diabetes when reporting on North Carolina’s rollout.
North Carolina has tried to follow most CDC recommendations, said SarahLewis Peel, a spokeswoman for the health department. However, Peel said, North Carolina has always intended to prioritize all diabetics for vaccines. 
People with both types of diabetes have been prioritized together since the state released its guidance for Group 4 on Jan. 25, she said.
Our ruling
The billboard says ""Cooper does not consider Type 1 diabetes an (underlying) health issue!""
North Carolina’s vaccine rollout prioritizes people with type 1 diabetes ahead of the general population. So it’s clear that Cooper, to some degree, considers the disease to be an underlying health issue.

Facebook posts","Facebook post gets debt wrong in comparison of Florida, Texas, California and New York




If Your Time is short





States commonly take on debt to pay for construction and environmental projects.


Debt is not the same as a budget shortfall. All four states have debt.


The amount of state budget shortfalls due to the pandemic is a moving target.


States can have debt and a balanced budget.





See the sources for this fact-check




The COVID-19 pandemic has put a massive strain on state budgets but some social media users have pointed the finger at Democrat-led states.
A Facebook post lists metrics for the four most populous states including their budgets. It states that Texas and Florida have ""balanced"" budgets while California is ""in debt $54 billion and New York is ""in debt $6.1 billion."" While this post didn’t comment on the party affiliations of the governors, similar posts point out that the governors of Florida and Texas are Republicans while the governors of New York and California are Democrats.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post is misleading in multiple ways. It fails to explain some basics about state budgets. 
First, it’s common for states to borrow money to construct state buildings, roads or environmental restoration. You can have debt and a balanced budget. And all of these states must pass a balanced budget. 
Second, the post describes certain dollar amounts as ""debt"" when they were actually shortfalls. All four states, in fact, carry billions of dollars in debt.
Shortfalls occur when revenue collections come in lower than expected and/or expenditures can come in higher than forecasted, said Brian Sigritz, the Director of State Fiscal Studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. Comparing different states’ budget gaps is difficult, because they tend to change month-to-month and states release revenue forecasts at different times.
Amid COVID-19, Sigritz warned that ""some states may not have announced a budget gap figure yet, but will likely face a shortfall.""
""Debt"" in the context of a state budget refers to the cumulative total of all past deficits, less surpluses. A projected shortfall or budget gap is the amount that state officials have to address in order to balance a state budget. 
RELATED: New York pension fund does not need a federal bailout
Florida’s budget, like all states, is expected to take a hit 
Florida’s total state direct debt outstanding as of June 30, 2019, was $20.6 billion.
""As for the impact of COVID-19, there is little official revenue data or estimates yet, although we know it will be big,"" said Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at Florida TaxWatch, a key budget watchdog organization.
April experienced an overall combined revenue loss of $878.1 million, the state estimated.
Wenner said that most officials believe there is enough in reserves and federal aid to avoid a deficit in this budget year.
""After the governor signs the new budget (and presumably vetoes a lot) and more revenue data comes in, we'll have a better idea of what the next fiscal year looks like,"" Wenner said.

Texas’ budget needs revisions, billions of dollars out of balance
Texas passes a budget every two years and the current budget year ends on Aug. 31, 2021.  
The state hasn’t revised the budget but Comptroller Glenn Hegar has said the economy is in a recession and announced that state sales tax revenues from April 2019 compared to April 2020 saw the steepest decline since January 2010.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested state agencies and universities submit a plan by June 15 that uses savings to reduce their use of revenue by 5%.
The Texas Tribune reported that the budget will be ""billions of dollars out of balance.""
The most recent calculations show Texas had a total of $59.9 billion in state debt by August 31, 2019. 
New York’s budget had a $6 billion budget gap, not debt
News articles at the end of 2019 stated that New York faced a $6.1 billion budget gap —-- before the pandemic hit. (The Citizens Budget Commission said the amount was $7 billion.)
In April, the state Assembly passed a $177 billion budget by borrowing, relying on federal aid and deferring some decisions. The budget for the 2020-2021 year started in April. 
The economic downturn has worsened the state’s finances. Before the pandemic, the state was expecting a 7% increase in revenue, but now it is expecting a 14% decline in revenue. A state estimate on April 25 puts revenue losses at $13.3 billion this year and $61 billion over the next four years. 
Outstanding debt at the end of fiscal year 2020, which closed on March 31, was $54.4 billion. The state issues debt for capital purposes such as road and bridge construction, environmental conservation, and facility construction.
California’s budget has a projected $16 billion budget gap
California’s debt was reported to be $129 billion as of May 1, 2020. In the 2020-21 budget Newsom proposed in January, the state of California planned to pay part of this debt and had a projected $5.6 billion budget surplus for the 2020-21 fiscal year.
This was before COVID-19 shut down businesses and led to high unemployment in California. In May, Politico reported new forecasts of a 25% plunge in ""the state's big three tax sources — personal income, sales and corporations"" would lead to a $54.3 billion deficit. 
Newsom released revisions to the budget on May 14 which are supposed to balance the budget for the next year. But there is a projected deficit in future years, culminating in $16 billion dollars by 2023-24. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post said Texas and Florida have a ""balanced budget"" while California is ""in debt $54 billion"" and New York is ""in debt $6.1 billion.""
This post misleads readers in multiple ways. First, it is possible to have debt and a balanced budget. Second, the post mixes up debt with budget shortfalls. All four states carry billions in debt. Third, it’s difficult to compare the current financial status of four different states because they have different budget cycles and the impact of the pandemic remains a moving economic target. 
While Florida and Texas have passed balance budgets, they too are certain to face economic woes related to the pandemic. 
In early May, California officials projected a $54 billion shortfall, but a new budget proposal lays out a plan to balance the budget, although it still leaves a projected future deficit. 
The $6.1 billion figure for New York stems from projections late last year about a shortfall, and ignores that the state has since passed a balanced budget.

If Your Time is short



• We found nothing in Dr. Anthony Fauci’s publicly disclosed emails to indicate that he urged a close relative to use hydroxychloroquine. 
• Fauci was consistent in his emails in arguing that anecdotal evidence suggesting hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy against the coronavirus would need to be demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial before recommending its use.
• Fauci’s stance in his private emails mirrored what he said publicly.



See the sources for this fact-check




Some social media users are seeking to tar Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as a hypocrite for how he handled his high-profile role as a scientific expert during the coronavirus pandemic.
A June 21 post claimed to have found a smoking gun in a batch of emails that Fauci sent early in the pandemic that were obtained by BuzzFeed and the Washington Post through a Freedom of Information Act request and published June 1.
According to the text of the Facebook post, ""One of Fauci's most incredible emails is the one in which he advises a family member to use hydroxychlorichin (sic) and antibiotic therapy, the same evening in which in a press conference he attacked (President Donald Trump) on the usefulness of hydroxychlorichin (sic) to fight the virus.""

 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We looked through the searchable database of Fauci’s publicly released emails and found some references to hydroxychloroquine, but nothing that matched the duplicity alleged in the Facebook post. All told, we found no indication that Fauci’s private comments were inconsistent with his public views of the drug, including what he said at White House press briefings.
Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19
The post was referring to hydroxychloroquine, a drug that’s well-established in the treatment of lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria and which attracted attention early in the pandemic as a possible treatment of COVID-19. 
In early 2020, two small trials, including one that used hydroxychloroquine along with the antibiotic azithromycin, reported that the virus was essentially gone in five days. But the research society that published that article later renounced it, saying it didn’t meet its standards.
Then-President Donald Trump championed the drug, despite skepticism from many medical experts, including Fauci, who cautioned that the evidence of the drug’s efficacy was anecdotal and needed to be confirmed by high-quality studies, especially since the drug carries a particular risk for people with heart problems, as well as other possible side effects.
A clinical trial was conducted by the National Institutes of Health to see whether the drug could be used as a treatment for COVID-19. The study was halted in June 2020 after it found hydroxychloroquine was ""very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19.""
Soon after, the Food and Drug Administration revoked a three-month-old emergency use authorization for the drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA said taking the drug could potentially lead to serious side effects including ""serious cardiac adverse events"" and that any potential benefits ""no longer outweigh the known and potential risks.""
Mentions of hydroxychloroquine in Fauci’s emails 
Hydroxychloroquine was specifically mentioned almost three-dozen times in Fauci’s emails, usually due to someone asking Fauci for his thoughts on the drug.
At no point in any of the publicly available emails sent by Fauci did he conclude that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment, much less urge a close relative to start using it.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







On Feb. 24, 2020, a pharmacologist at the federal Food and Drug Administration asked Fauci whether there was any proof to back up a claim from China about hydroxychloroquine being able to ""decrease COVID-19 infections and lung disease.""
""There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim. There are a lot of these types of claims going around. I would love to see their data,"" Fauci responded.
In several subsequent emails asking about the drug, Fauci acknowledged the existence of anecdotal accounts about hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness but said he was waiting on high-quality studies, like the one NIH was conducting.
On April 23, 2020, NIH press staff sent Fauci an email seeking to finalize language for a press release that said in his name, ""Although there is anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes."" 
In his response to the email, Fauci wrote that the draft language ""looks fine.""
Fauci’s public statements
Fauci’s emails echoed statements he made publicly about the drug, which were to withhold any official position until a controlled clinical trial was complete.
His most extensive comments on hydroxychloroquine from the White House briefing room were in March 2020. At the time, a reporter asked Fauci about whether there was evidence that hydroxychloroquine might be effective against the coronavirus. 
""The answer is no,"" Fauci responded, adding that the reporter was talking about anecdotal evidence that ""was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can't make any definitive statement about it."" 
Fauci’s remarks the following day, March 21, took the same approach:
""The president is talking about hope for people. And it's not an unreasonable thing: to hope for people. So when you have approved drugs that physicians have the option and a decision between the physician and the patient, are you going to use a drug that someone says, from an anecdotal standpoint, not completely proven, but might have some effect? There are those who lean to the point of giving hope and saying, ‘Give that person the option of having access to that drug.’ 
""And then you have the other group — which is my job, as a scientist — to say my job is to ultimately prove, without a doubt, that a drug is not only safe, but that it actually works. Those two things are really not incompatible, when you think about that, particularly when you're in an arena where you don't have anything that's proven.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post said that one of Fauci's ""most incredible emails is the one in which he advises a family member to use (hydroxychloroquine) and antibiotic therapy, the same evening in which in a press conference he attacked (Trump) on the usefulness of  (hydroxychloroquine) to fight the virus.""
We found nothing in Fauci’s publicly disclosed emails that supports the claim that he urged a close relative to use hydroxychloroquine. To the contrary, Fauci in his emails was consistent in arguing, both publicly and privately, that anecdotal evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy in the pandemic would need to be demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial before its use could be recommended.
We rate the statement False.

Joe Biden","Joe Biden wrongly claims Trump could’ve prevented every COVID-19 death




If Your Time is short





Experts said Joe Biden’s claim that a different pandemic response from President Donald Trump would have prevented every coronavirus death goes too far.


A more robust handling of the pandemic would likely have seen the country’s death count significantly reduced, but not to zero, experts said.


Even countries that have found relative success managing the coronavirus — such as South Korea and New Zealand — have seen some deaths.





See the sources for this fact-check




Speaking about the coronavirus during a CNN town hall less than two months away from Election Day, former Vice President Joe Biden said every one of the nearly 200,000 COVID-19 deaths recorded in the U.S. can be laid at President Donald Trump’s feet.
""If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive,"" Biden said at the CNN town hall in Moosic, Pa. ""All the people. I'm not making this up. Just look at the data. Look at the data.""
The Democratic presidential nominee’s remark came as Trump faces criticism for downplaying the threat of the coronavirus early on and admitting on tape that he did so. The U.S. leads the world in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, and experts say a fall surge in cases could put fatalities at more than double their current number by the year’s end.
A more robust handling of the pandemic would likely have seen the country’s death count significantly reduced, experts said. But Biden’s claim that a different response from Trump would have prevented every coronavirus death goes too far.
""I think it’s impossible to say every life could have been saved,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.
Keeping COVID-19 at zero deaths would have been a difficult achievement ""regardless of who is in charge,"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. 
""If we had developed testing capacity as soon as we knew of the pathogen, and could rapidly test every one arriving from abroad, then I suppose it’s theoretically possible, but unlikely,"" Nichols said.
Even countries that have found relative success managing the coronavirus — such as South Korea and New Zealand — have seen some deaths. 
Experts said that faster, more robust measures taken by the federal government could have put the U.S. on par with those countries and others that responded similarly. 
The right actions in January, February and March would likely have prevented ""a substantial number"" of deaths, Adalja said, and could have put the U.S. on ""a trajectory more like Taiwan,"" which has recorded just 503 confirmed cases and seven deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Those actions might have included a national coordinated strategy across state lines, rapidly scaled up testing, the ramped up production and mobilization of resources, and more clear communications of what was known about the virus and how to prevent it, experts said.
""Obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told CNN in April. ""Obviously, no one is going to deny that.""

One May study from Columbia University estimated that the U.S. could have averted roughly 36,000 COVID-19 deaths before May if sweeping mitigation measures imposed on March 15 had instead gone into effect a week earlier. 
Almost 54,000 deaths would have been avoided in that timeframe had the same interventions started two weeks earlier, the study said.

Other experts have also made estimates. A pair of epidemiologists wrote in an April op-ed for the New York Times that ""an estimated 90% of deaths"" from the first wave of U.S. cases ""might have been prevented by putting social distancing policies into effect two weeks earlier."" 
Op-ed co-author Nicholas Jewell, a professor of biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said it would be ""magical thinking"" to suggest 100% of COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented. ""I haven’t seen any country really succeed to that extent,"" Jewell said.
In a June op-ed for Stat, researchers compared the U.S. response to similar nations. Accounting for differences in population and the different timings of the outbreaks in each country, they concluded that the U.S. could have prevented many deaths. 
If, for example, the U.S. ""had acted as effectively as Germany, 70% of U.S. coronavirus deaths might have been prevented"" in the four months after the U.S. recorded its first 15 cases of the coronavirus, the researchers wrote. More lives would have been saved had the U.S. mirrored the responses of other countries such as South Korea, they said.
The picture hasn’t been much rosier of late. ""If you look at May and June 1, since then, we’ve done dreadfully in the U.S.,"" Jewell said.
Still, Biden’s claim that ""all the people would still be alive"" had Trump responded differently is an overstatement. ""I don’t see how there is any truth to that,"" Nichols said.
The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Our ruling
Biden said, ""If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people. I'm not making this up. Just look at the data.""
Experts disagreed with that assessment. A stronger U.S. response could have saved many lives, experts said, but not every one.

Facebook posts","Pandemics like COVID haven’t hit exactly every 100 years, despite claim




If Your Time is short





The post suggests pandemics occur with synchronicity every 100 years, in 1720, 1820, 1920 and 2020.


There wasn’t a pandemic in 1720. The years listed for the next two pandemics are wrong.


Many more pandemics have occurred outside of a neat timeline.





See the sources for this fact-check




According to this post on Facebook, pandemics like COVID-19 strike with eerie precision, every 100 years:
""1720 — Plague; 1820 — Cholera outbreak; 1920 — Spanish flu; 2020 — Chinese coronavirus. What’s happening? There is a theory that every 100 years, a pandemic happens. At first glance, nothing seems strange, but the accuracy with which these events take place is scary.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The plague cited wasn’t a pandemic; two of the other examples didn’t occur neatly in the years cited; and, most importantly, numerous other pandemics have occurred without such synchronicity.
""I am suspicious of the idea that pandemics operate to a railroad timetable,"" Yale University history professor Frank Snowden, author of ""Epidemics and Society,"" told PolitiFact, noting several problems with the post. 
Many more than 4 pandemics
The World Health Organization defines pandemic as: ""The worldwide spread of a new disease."" 
The definition from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is nearly the same: ""A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably.""
The Facebook post suggests that pandemics only occur every 100 years. But that ignores numerous pandemics, including the Great Plague of London, in 1665; yellow fever in the late 1800s; the H2N2/Asian flu in 1957-1958; the H3N2 flu virus in 1968; and the H1N1/swine flu in 2009.
Now, a breakdown of the four outbreaks cited in the post:
Plague — 1720-1722
Plague, an infectious fever caused by a bacterium transmitted from rodents to humans by the bite of infected fleas, caused some of the worst pandemics in history, according to Britannica.com. 
What was known as Great Plague of Provence, or Great Plague of Marseille, killed as many as 126,000 people in southern France starting in 1720, according to an article by Cindy Ermus, a history professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio who is writing a book on the outbreak. But because this particular episode of plague happened largely in France, it wasn’t a pandemic.

Cholera — 1817
The first pandemic of cholera began three years before the post claimed.
""Since first spreading from Calcutta along the Ganges Delta in 1817, it has killed millions,"" says the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which supports health research and programs. 
During the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in the Soho district of London, according to the foundation, English physician John Snow had, based on his theory that cholera was transmitted by exposure to contaminated water, ""used extensive interviews and intricately plotted maps to trace the source of the outbreak to a single water pump. Disabling the pump ended the outbreak almost immediately, in a poignant example of an early, effective public health intervention.""
Spanish flu — 1918-1919
This influenza pandemic started two years before what the post claims and is more accurately called ""The Great Influenza"" by modern historians.
The pandemic ""was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919,"" according to the CDC. ""In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.""
It was called the Spanish flu ""not because it originated in Spain but because it was World War I, and Spain was the only country being honest about the toll the pandemic took on the country,"" according to a Washington Post article on the deadliest pandemics in history.
Coronavirus — 2019-2020
The post is more or less correct in saying this pandemic is from 2020.
COVID-19 can be traced back at least to Dec. 31, 2019, when the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause. Eight days later, China identified a new type of coronavirus. The first coronavirus case in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 21, 2020.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, saying it is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. 
Our ruling
A claim on Facebook that a pandemic occurs exactly every 100 years cites four outbreaks that it says occurred in 1720, 1820, 1920 and 2020. But the first example was not a pandemic and the second and third started a couple of years before 1820 and 1920. 
More importantly, the claim ignores many other pandemics over several centuries that did not occur in such a neat pattern.

Natural News has published health misinformation in the past.

Editor’s note, May 17, 2021: When this fact-check was first published in February 2020, PolitiFact’s sources included researchers who asserted the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have been manipulated. That assertion is now more widely disputed. Read our May 2021 report for more on the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. That dispute notwithstanding, the assertion that ""the coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab"" is unsubstantiated and lacks evidence. We continue to rate the claim False. 
As the 2019 coronavirus continues to spread around the world, an anti-vaccine website has concocted a conspiracy theory about its source.
In a blog post published Feb. 3, Natural News, a website known to promote health misinformation, lays out an ""irrefutable"" conspiracy that the coronavirus is man-made.
""The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab,"" the story reads.
The article goes on to say that the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are ""covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China."" Natural News does not provide evidence for the claim.
The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 2,700 times.

PolitiFact has fact-checked several hoaxes and conspiracies about the 2019 coronavirus, which has infected more than 37,000 people globally and killed 812 in China. The outbreak started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has since spread to 24 countries.
One of the most popular conspiracies about the coronavirus is that it was created in a lab, possibly as a bioweapon. We’ve previously said those claims are unproven — and the Natural News story has similar shortcomings.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







The website says that ""every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists."" But none of the researchers that has analyzed the virus has come to that conclusion.
According to the CDC, both the agency and Chinese authorities have isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.""
We analyzed the eight publications the CDC lists on its landing page about coronavirus. None asserts that the virus was engineered by humans.
RELATED: PolitiFact’s coronavirus coverage in one place
One study, which analyzed the genetic sequence of the coronavirus, was published Jan. 30 in the journal The Lancet. It says the 2019 coronavirus is a human betacoronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and likely comes from bats.
""Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans,"" the study reads. 
Early reports on the virus focused on the fact that many patients were linked to the Wuhan market. That suggested animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC, but later, a growing number of patients reported not having any connection to the market. That suggested the coronavirus was spreading person-to-person.
Other blogs and social media users have speculated that a lab near Wuhan could be the source of the virus. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola and SARS. As of now, however, there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the outbreak.

Dan Forest","No, the flu hasn't killed more people than coronavirus




If Your Time is short




North Carolina Lt. Governor Dan Forest, a Republican, is running for governor against Democratic incumbent Roy Cooper and has criticized Cooper's stay-at-home order as too heavy-handed.
In an interview on April 24, Forest said coronavirus deaths hadn't topped flu deaths for the year. He cherry-picked from the CDC's prediction that flu deaths could be as low as 24,000 or as high as 62,000.
Forest then compared that 62,000 estimate to the CDC's ongoing tally of coronavirus deaths -- a comparison experts say is unfair and inaccurate.




See the sources for this fact-check




Some people have tried to put COVID-19 into perspective by comparing it with the flu.
On April 24, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest told a group of young Republicans that the flu had actually killed more people than the novel coronavirus.
Forest, who’s running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, has suggested that North Carolina’s stay-at-home order might be disproportionate to the effects of COVID-19 in his state.
In a video interview, Forest said:
""You know, we’ve still had more deaths to the flu this year than we’ve had COVID-19,"" Forest said, adding: ""There’s been about three times more deaths for HIV/AIDS, remember that was a pandemic at one time that still has no vaccine. This one’s bad. It’s obviously worse than the normal flu year, but it hasn’t hit the extremes of other pandemics yet.""
Forest also compared COVID-19 with HIV. But let’s focus on Forest’s claim about the flu, since that’s what it’s most commonly compared with.
It isn’t clear from Forest’s claim if he is talking about the United States or North Carolina. So we’ll address those stats at the both state and national level.
Is Forest right? 
No. And there are several reasons why Forest’s comparison is neither fair, nor accurate:


He compared diseases that entered the United States at different times.


When it comes to flu deaths across the U.S., he based his claim on an estimate — and cherry-picked the worst case scenario from that estimate.


He overlooked data from his home state, where publicly available information showed there had been more COVID-19 deaths than flu deaths.


It’s important to note first that the flu and COVID-19 did not enter the U.S. at the same time. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started tracking the flu in 2019, authorities didn’t report the first case of the novel coronavirus until Jan. 20. The first death occurred on Feb. 29.
If the diseases were in a race, the flu got several months of a head start. 
""Comparing deaths from laboratory confirmed cases of COVID that occurred between Feb. 29–April 24 to statistical model estimations of all flu deaths (detected and undetected) from October 1–April 4 is not at all equitable,"" said Dr. Ben King, clinical assistant professor of public health at the University of Texas Dell Medical School. 
With that said, let’s look at the numbers that are available.
Flu and COVID-19 deaths
As of April 25, the day after Forest made his claim, more than 50,000 people had died from COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The estimate has grown to 65,700 by May 4.
Some experts believe the CDC’s numbers to be low. A study released by the Washington Post and the Yale School of Public Health on April 27 found that experts missed as many as 15,000 coronavirus deaths in the first weeks after the virus arrived in the U.S.
What about flu deaths? The CDC doesn’t have up-to-date flu death numbers. Forest based his claim on the CDC’s estimate that flu deaths could be as high as 62,000, Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn told PolitiFact in an email.
A problem for Forest’s claim? That CDC estimate also predicted flu deaths could be as low as 24,000. That’s a wide range, which has recently drawn criticism.
In an April 28 Scientific American column titled, ""Comparing COVID-19 Deaths to Flu Deaths Is Like Comparing Apples to Oranges,"" a Harvard Medical School instructor explains the CDC’s prediction methods — and argues they should change.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







CDC flu estimates
Dr. Jeremy Samuel Faust, who practices emergency medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, noted that the CDC tries to account for unreported flu deaths ""by multiplying the number of flu death counts reported by various coefficients produced through complicated algorithms,"" he wrote.
Indeed, the CDC’s estimation process is ""fairly elaborate,"" said William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
The CDC estimates deaths, rather than counting raw numbers, in part because death certificates ""can be mushy,"" Schaffner told PolitiFact in a phone interview. Deceased people can sometimes have multiple health problems, leaving the cause of death up for debate. Compounding matters, processes for determining and recording causes of death vary across the country.
Faust, who wrote the column, argued that the number of actual flu deaths could be much lower than the CDC’s estimate. As the Washington Post pointed out on May 2, the number of actual deaths directly contributed to the flu has been less than 10,000 each of the past two seasons.
In the past, Faust said it was justifiable to err on the side of substantially overestimating flu deaths ""in order to encourage vaccination and good hygiene."" But now, ""the CDC’s reporting about flu deaths is dangerously misleading the public and even public officials about the comparison between these two viruses.""
Past flu seasons
Without a clear idea of how many flu deaths might be tallied for the 2019-20 season, we turned to past totals and estimates.
The CDC preliminary estimates show that 34,000 people likely died from the flu in the 2018-2019 season and that 61,000 died over the 2017-18 season.
Finalized CDC data shows that 38,000 died between 2016-17 and 23,000 died between 2015-16. That’s an average of about 39,000 flu deaths over the last four seasons, (assuming death estimates from the last two seasons turn out to be accurate.)
The 2017-18 season stands out as one of the highest in history, according to Reuters. Flu deaths only topped 60,000 on three other occasions. About 100,000 Americans died of the flu in 1967, about 116,000 died in 1957, and nearly 675,000 died from the 1918 flu.
We asked Schaffner if it’s possible to predict flu deaths and flu severity based on reports from prior years. It’s difficult, he said.
""There’s a saying: If you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season,"" Schaffner said, emphasizing that each season can be different and unpredictable. 
Coronavirus deaths
The CDC hasn’t offered a prediction of how many Americans might die from COVID-19 over the course of this year’s season.
Modeling from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has offered death counts in the range of 48,000 to 123,000. On April 24, the day of Forest’s claim, Politico reported that the institute was predicting about 67,000 deaths. On May 4, the institute’s model predicted 134,000 deaths by Aug. 4. 
Information on flu deaths is limited. But Lisa Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins, recently wrote that coronavirus deaths are ""thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.""
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, agreed. In an email, she said, ""SARS-CoV-2 is at least as deadly as the highest flu estimate, and over the year will undoubtedly be more so.""
What if the flu does turn out to kill 62,000 over the course of the season? That would still make it less deadly than the coronavirus on a per-day basis, CNN reported on May 1.
If 62,000 people died from the flu between Oct. 1 and April 4, that would mean the U.S. had an average of about 331 flu deaths a day, CNN reported. By contrast, CNN estimated that an average of 739 people died per day from coronavirus between February and the end of April, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
North Carolina stats
While flu deaths across the U.S. have yet to be determined, flu data is more definitive in Forest’s home state. And it further proves him wrong.
Mandy Cohen, North Carolina’s health secretary, announced on April 20 that COVID-19 deaths had surpassed flu deaths in less than a month.
Cohen said in a press conference that 179 people died between March 24, when North Carolina recorded its first coronavirus death, and April 20. By contrast, WUNC reported, 167 people had died over the course of the flu season, which started in September.
By April 25, a day after Forest made his claim, the NC Department of Health and Human Services, had reported 177 flu deaths and more than 300 coronavirus deaths. By May 3, there had been 183 flu deaths and 430 coronavirus deaths. 
Our ruling
On April 24, Forest said: ""We’ve still had more deaths to the flu this year than we’ve had COVID-19.""
Forest phrased his claim in a way that makes it seem like health experts were keeping and publicizing an ongoing log of flu deaths across America. That’s not the case.
The CDC predicts that the number of flu deaths will be anywhere between 24,000 and 62,000. Forest cherry-picked the highest number possible, and then compared it to the CDC’s running tally of coronavirus deaths. That’s unfair because he compared an estimate to an actual number, and because the diseases entered the U.S. at different times.
Forest’s claim isn’t true for his home state either. In fact, Forest never proved that there have been more flu deaths than coronavirus deaths as of April 24. We rate his claim False.",Facebook Live interview,https://www.facebook.com/NCYoungGOP/videos/274455633559065/,null,,null,

Facebook posts","No sign spike proteins from COVID-19 vaccines, including Novavax, are dangerous




If Your Time is short





U.S. public health authorities and vaccine experts say there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein is toxic.


A vaccine expert said the vaccine developed by Novamax contains a single viral protein.





See the sources for this fact-check




Following news that a COVID-19 vaccine from drug maker Novavax has been found in a trial to be 90% effective, a widely shared social media post alleged that the vaccine is dangerous. 
The post came from Jane Ruby in response to a tweet about a June 14 New York Times story about Novavax announcing the results of a 29,960-person clinical trial in the U.S. and Mexico. 
The vaccine contains a ""dangerous spike protein,"" Ruby tweeted. ""Novavax injection just dumps millions of spike proteins right into your body.""
Ruby adds: ""Can’t wait to see all the myocarditis from that.""
There’s no evidence to support the claim that spike protein is dangerous. The spike proteins produced as a result of vaccination help stimulate the body’s defenses against COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls them ""harmless.""
Ruby, whose Twitter account identifies her as ""Dr. Jane Ruby,"" is not a medical doctor. She describes herself as a health economist and ""New Right political pundit"" with a doctorate in psychology. Her LinkedIn profile shows he has a background in pharmaceutical research and nursing.
We messaged Ruby via Twitter but didn’t get a reply.
We have fact-checked other spike protein claims, finding that there is no evidence they present any serious health risk on their own. 
We rated False a claim by Canadian viral immunologist Byram Bridle that the COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein means people are being inoculated ""with a toxin."" Experts said there is no evidence that the vaccines produce a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage, as Bridle alleged.
We also rated False a claim that COVID-19 vaccines’ ""spike protein is very dangerous, it's cytotoxic,"" which means toxic to cells. U.S. public health authorities and vaccine experts said there is no evidence that the vaccines’ spike protein is toxic or ""cytotoxic.""

Ruby’s mention of myocarditis alludes to reports of a higher-than-expected number of cases of heart inflammation developing in mostly young people after they received doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which use a different mechanism than the Novavax vaccine to induce an immune response.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it will convene an emergency meeting on June 18 to discuss a possible link between the condition and the vaccines. Other health organizations, like the European Medicines Agency, are also investigating.
So far, there’s no conclusive evidence that these cases are caused by the vaccines or the spike proteins.
Novavax, which is seeking to become the fourth company with a vaccine approved for use in the U.S., said the trial showed its vaccine ""demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4% efficacy overall."" The company said it plans to seek regulatory authorizations during the third quarter of 2021 and expects to be able to manufacture 100 million doses per month by the end of the quarter.
A spokesperson for Novavax said its vaccine is derived from the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. ""It is a harmless protein that can neither replicate nor can it cause COVID-19,"" she said. ""It ‘teaches’ your immune system to recognize the virus so that when exposed to the real thing, your body is prepared to mount an effective immune response.""
The protein-based Novavax vaccine is similar in its approach to the influenza vaccine Flublok, containing a single viral protein, the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee.
""This protein has not been shown to be dangerous,"" he said. ""It's just a single viral protein similar to the hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccines, and are remarkably safe."" 
""The SARS-CoV-2 virus, on the other hand, reproduces itself thousands of times, and is incredibly dangerous.""
The National Institutes of Health said data from the trial ""indicate the investigational vaccine was generally well-tolerated."" The most common side effects were mild to moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache and temporary muscle pain.

Bloggers","Did Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi sneak money into the COVID-19 relief bill?




If Your Time is short





The American Rescue Plan Act sends $12.6 billion to New York State and $464 million to San Francisco as part of $350 billion in state and local aid. 


Billions of dollars are going to Republican states like Florida and Texas, and about $143 billion is going to Republican-led states. 


The funding wasn’t snuck in. It was one of the most publicly debated issues in the relief package.





See the sources for this fact-check




Once President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan Act, more than $350 billion will start to flow to state, tribal and local governments. Democrats hail the massive infusion of cash as a much needed tonic to heal the broad damage of the pandemic. Republicans have opposed it at every turn.
The conservative website Trending Politics tied that particular funding stream — which is going to local governments across the country — to the machinations of the top two congressional Democrats.
The site’s headline called it ""pure corruption.""
""Schumer and Pelosi sneak funding into COVID bill to save them from their own failures,"" the March 8 article said. ""The new stimulus package will be erasing San Francisco’s projected $650 million deficit which grew as a result to (sic) Democrats’, specifically Nancy Pelosi’s, poor management. The package will also be erasing Chuck Schumer’s deficit in New York.""
It’s a stretch to blame two federal elected officials for the financial woes of their home district or state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t the mayor of San Francisco, nor is Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer the governor of New York. 
But beyond that, the article’s first flaw is that there was nothing secret about this effort.
Aid to states and localities was the single biggest item that Democrats wanted and that Republicans rejected.
Democrats clamored for it in the December COVID-19 relief bill, but with Republicans running the Senate, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell firmly opposed, the idea was crushed.
After the Senate switched hands, the $350 billion was back in play.
The measure promised $220 billion for states, territories and tribal governments, and $130 billion for cities and counties in order ""to mitigate the fiscal effects stemming from the public health emergency."" 
State and local leaders can spend the money pretty much any way they like, except for two things: It can’t go to fund pension plans, and it can’t be used to pay for tax cuts.
Both San Francisco and New York state faced budget gaps. San Francisco expected a shortfall of $411 million (not the $650 million in the web article) and for New York, the amount was $15.1 billion. Without aid, both jurisdictions warned of service cuts and tax hikes.
The new bill has $464 million for San Francisco and $12.6 billion for New York. That would more than fill the hole in San Francisco, and largely fill the one that New York projected.
Where the money will go
What the Trending Politics piece never mentions is that thanks to the formulas that drive how the money gets divvied up, Republicans also do well under the bill. Those formulas use a mix of unemployment rates, population, poverty and housing factors to set each state’s and locality’s allocation.

Says Anthony Fauci will make millions off new book.












By Samantha Putterman • June 15, 2021







We might not know how the money will be spent, but there’s little mystery about where its first stop will be after it leaves Washington. The House Government Oversight Committee has a spreadsheet with all the allocation details.
The article singled out New York and the $12.6 billion the state government will get. But it could just have easily noted the $16.7 billion headed to Texas, home to Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Florida, with its Republican governor and two Republican senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott is due to get $10.2 billion. (All totals rise if funds to counties, cities and tribal governments are folded in.)
Pelosi was called out for the money going to San Francisco — about $464 million — but Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s California district will also benefit. About $270 million is headed to the city of Bakersfield and to Kern County. Part of his district sits in Los Angeles, which is due to get about $1.9 billion. And like Pelosi’s, McCarthy’s constituents will gain from the $26 billion going to the state of California.

In the overall tally, Democratic-led states do better. About $190 billion goes to states with Democratic governors and $143 billion goes to states headed by Republicans. That’s due as much to demographics as politics. Republicans predominate among states that have smaller populations. If money follows people, more of it will flow to blue states.
Loopholes?
Funding pensions and paying for tax cuts are the only two big limits on the federal dollars. But money is money. If a state repairs a bridge with pandemic relief funds, it will free up money for other purposes — for example, funding pensions.
The bill includes penalties for that.
""In theory, if money is used to shore up pension funds, or directly or indirectly funds a tax cut, then the Treasury Department could come back and make the state refund some money,"" said Kim Reuben, director of the state and local finance initiative at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington policy group.
In practice, Reuben said, the connection between federal dollars and state and local finances might not be obvious. The state and local officials she talks to hope the Treasury Department makes things clear quickly.
""Governments are excited to get the money, but they are nervous about what Washington will say that might disqualify the money for the uses they have in mind,"" Reuben said.
The bill’s intent, Reuben said, is for state and local leaders to spend the money on what they couldn’t otherwise afford. There could be considerable debate over how well state and local governments stick to that goal.
Our ruling
Trending Politics said Schumer and Pelosi snuck money into the COVID-19 relief bill to solve their own problems back home. 
The bill sends billions to New York and millions to San Francisco.
But that was never any secret. The legislation has $350 billion for state, tribal and local governments, and Republicans have vigorously opposed that for many months.
The Trending Politics article failed to mention the billions flowing to Republican-led states and congressional districts.

Facebook posts","Clorox bottles don’t prove the coronavirus was 'developed' before the outbreak




Some social media users are publishing photos of Clorox bottles to claim that the coronavirus was created before the outbreak in China.
In a Jan. 28 Facebook post, one user published a photo of what appears to be a Clorox bottle listing the viruses the cleaning agent kills when used on surfaces. ""Human Coronavirus"" is circled in red. 
""So it turns out that that ‘brand new’ ‘never before seen’ ‘insanely contageous’ (sic) ‘crazy deadly’ ‘better buy your casket right now’ virus that has ‘randomly broke out’ in China... yeah turns out my Clorox bottle claimed it could kill it... before it was developed - I mean discovered,"" the post reads.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has more than 2,000 shares.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
We’ve seen plenty of hoaxes that falsely conflate the 2019 coronavirus with other strains of the illness. And this post is no different.
There are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans. They were first identified in the mid-1960s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and some of the viruses are quite common.
The latest coronavirus, categorized as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is the strain that is spreading from Wuhan, China. More than 6,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization’s Jan. 29 situation report. There is no evidence that it was ""developed"" prior to the outbreak.
So while some Clorox labels mention ""human coronavirus,"" that is because it has been proven effective against past strains of coronavirus, which is to say it can be used on surfaces to stem the spread of the virus (it should never be ingested!). In a blog post published Jan. 24, Clorox said that several of its products are effective at killing coronaviruses ""similar to"" the 2019 strain.

Usually, per Environmental Protection Agency regulations, companies aren’t allowed to make claims about the efficacy of disinfectants against pathogens unless regulators have reviewed them. But the coronavirus outbreak has triggered emergency guidance from the EPA.

That guidance sets forth two criteria. First, a manufacturer’s disinfectant must be registered with the EPA for use on ""hard, porous or non-porous surfaces."" Second, the disinfectant’s label must make previously approved claims about its efficacy against one of three ""viral pathogen groupings."" 
Clorox said three of its products meet those criteria, including disinfecting wipes, disinfecting bleach and ""Clean-Up Cleaner + Bleach.""

Donald Trump","Trump’s false claim that it’s up to him — not governors — to open states




If Your Time is short





Reopening businesses, schools and public facilities is a decision with major implications for public health, the economy and education.


Governors have issued their own closures of non-essential businesses without Trump’s direction.


Legal experts say governors have the right to order closures of non-essential businesses and end such closures.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump said it’s up to him — not the governors — to decide when to reopen the states amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect,"" Trump tweeted April 13. ""It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!""
....It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020 
Trump’s tweet comes as he weighs whether to extend his stay-at-home guidelines, which expire April 30, a decision he has described as ""the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.""
Reopening businesses, schools and public facilities is a decision with major implications for public health, the economy and education. But Trump’s tweet is misleading because governors do have power to shut down — and reopen — businesses and public spaces in their state.
Trump has traded barbs with governors during the pandemic, especially over where responsibility lies in securing medical supplies for the states. But governors have largely made their own calls about what to close down.
It’s not surprising, then, that governors pushed back against Trump’s comments on who has authority to ""open up the states.""
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, said on CNN: ""Governors made decisions to take various actions in their states based on what they thought was right for their states, based on the facts on the ground, talking with doctors and scientists. And I think individual governors who made those decisions will have the ultimate decision about what to do with their states.""
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said on CNN that ""all these orders are executive state orders, so therefore it would be up to the state and governor to undo all of that.""
We contacted the White House to ask for evidence behind Trump’s claim and did not get a reply.
Governors have power to issue closures
On March 16, Trump issued guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19, which included recommendations on social distancing and to ""listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.""
But it was the governors who issued more specific directives that closed non-essential businesses and many other facilities, such as schools, bars, swimming pools and beaches.
Many legal experts and political scientists have said that governors have the authority to make such decisions.
States provide licenses for businesses and hold the primary responsibility for making decisions about public health.
""The simple answer is governors have way more legal authority than the president of the United States to make these decisions about closing and opening facilities, closing and opening the economy,"" said David Schultz, professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney told PolitiFact that Trump has no inherent or statutory authority to command the governors to change shelter-in-place or business-shutdown orders.
While federal powers are supreme, they are limited in scope, Chesney wrote in the Lawfare Blog in March. State governments are independent entities, not mere subordinate layers underneath the federal government, he wrote.
""The federal government cannot commandeer the machinery of the state governments (or, by extension, of local governments),"" Chesney wrote. ""That is, the federal government cannot coerce the states into taking actions to suit federal policy preference. … And so, the federal government cannot compel state and local officials to promulgate different rules on social distancing and the like.""
No existing federal law — including the Public Health Service Act and the Stafford Act — can be read to confer such authority on the president, Chesney wrote. And there is little chance that this Congress will pass a law that gives Trump power to override state and local rules. 
James Hodge Jr., a health law professor at Arizona State University, said the president can’t simply command states to re-open.
""He can strongly encourage, advise, or even litigate whether states’ authorities to restrict public movements re: shelter in place or stay home orders are warranted, but cannot tell sovereign governors to lift these orders all at once just because the federal government determines it is high time to do so,"" he told PolitiFact in an email.
There are other ways Trump could pressure governors, tweeted University of Texas law school professor Steve Vladeck. He could pull emergency funding, or call the federal workforce back into work, Vladeck listed as examples. Still, most action has been taken by local authorities.
Wendy K. Mariner, Boston University health law professor, said the governors have the authority to end their closure orders, though that isn’t the same as ordering them to reopen, which some may not be able to afford to do. Also, in most states, the state legislature can end the emergency declaration if the governor keeps it going beyond the period specified by statute.
Trump’s tweet raises some practical implications. Congress can pass legislation to regulate interstate commerce, but it would be exceedingly odd for the federal government to require businesses to open. 
""As a practical matter, such an unprecedented action would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce,"" she said.
Trump also tweeted that he’s making a decision ""in conjunction with the Governors and input from others."" But governors don’t necessarily speak with a collective voice, said Chris Cooper, a Western Carolina University political scientist, who noted that some states have not enacted statewide stay-at-home orders.
Though Trump has criticized some governors, he has generally not interfered with their powers.
In a press briefing April 10, Trump said that he had faith in Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to make the right decision about whether to reopen schools in May.
""I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done,"" he said. ""If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I’d rather have them — you can call it ‘federalist,’ you can call it ‘the Constitution,’ but I call it ‘the Constitution.’ I would rather have them make their decisions.""
Our ruling
Trump said ""it is the decision of the President,"" not governors, to ""open up the states.""
The White House provided no evidence to show that it is up to Trump and not the governors to reopen the states. The governors used their authority to issue emergency orders to close non-essential businesses and public spaces such as beaches and swimming pools, and they can use their powers to reopen them.
Trump can pressure governors to act as he sees fit, but he has not provided evidence that he can decide whether to reopen the states.

Donald Trump","‘We don’t want that,’ Trump says of New Zealand after country reported nine new COVID-19 cases




If Your Time is short





New Zealand reported nine new cases on Aug. 17, the day of Trump’s remark. The nation previously went over 100 days without an instance of community spread.


The U.S. leads the world in cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths and has reported more than 50,000 new cases per day for most of August and July.





See the sources for this fact-check




Speaking in Minnesota ahead of the Democratic National Convention, President Donald Trump compared the ongoing surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. to the situation in New Zealand, where the virus returned recently after more than 100 days of no community spread.
""When you look at the rest of the world ... now all the sudden, a lot of the places that they were using to hold up, they’re having a big surge,"" Trump said Aug. 17 in a speech at an airport in Mankato, Minn. ""They were holding up names of countries, and now they’re saying, ‘Whoops.’""
""In fact, even New Zealand. You see what's going on in New Zealand?"" the president continued. ""They beat it. They beat it. It was like front page, they beat it, because they wanted to show me something. The problem is, big surge in New Zealand. It's terrible. We don't want that.""

New Zealand, an island nation of about 5 million people, saw the return of the virus’ community spread on Aug. 11 after months with no locally transmitted cases. 
But on Aug. 17, the day of Trump’s remark, New Zealand had reported just nine new COVID-19 cases. The previous day, it reported 13 new cases, up from seven new cases on Aug. 15. 
On Aug. 18, following Trump’s comment, New Zealand reported another 13 new cases.
The new cases in recent days have caused alarm in New Zealand, where strict lockdown policies and travel restrictions aim to put a lid on the virus. The leadership has responded by postponing the country’s election and locking down Auckland, its largest city. 
Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, said it’s a stretch for Trump to say New Zealand had ever ""beat"" the virus, since the pandemic was raging elsewhere and New Zealand has needed mitigation efforts to keep cases low.
But New Zealand’s new cases are a far cry from the outbreak in the U.S., which has reported more than 50,000 new cases per day for most of August and July, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day average of new cases in the U.S. was 50,927 on Aug. 17.
""That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard in quite a while,"" Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University, said of Trump’s claim comparing the two nations.

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







As of Aug. 18, New Zealand’s health ministry had recorded 1,643 confirmed and probable cases in total, along with 22 deaths. There are currently 90 active cases in the country.
The U.S. leads the world in cumulative cases and deaths, by contrast. It has seen nearly 5.5 million cases and more than 171,000 deaths as of Aug. 18. That’s a quarter of the world’s known cases in a country that, with around 330 million people, represents about 4% of the global population.
The disparity is wide even when you adjust for the size of both countries. According to the World Health Organization, the United States has 16,175 confirmed cases for every 1 million people. New Zealand has 268 confirmed cases per million people.

New Zealand reported nine new cases on Aug. 17, the day of Trump’s remark. The U.S., by contrast, has frequently reported more than 50,000 cases per day since July.

The syringes can include an optional chip on the label — not inside the injected dose itself — that would show if a particular dose is expired or counterfeit. The chips would not be injected with the vaccine, nor would they gather information on patients or allow their locations to be tracked.

Chris Kapenga","Wisconsin senator wrong to attribute rising COVID cases to testing




If Your Time is short





Testing rates were dropping — not rising — as COVID-19 cases rose in late June.


Health officials say contract tracing has revealed many new cases stem from bars, parties and other events where social distancing is not being maintained, particularly among residents in their 20s.





See the sources for this fact-check




After an extended period of mostly positive trends, COVID-19 is making a resurgence in America.
At least 21 states were pausing reopening plans or taking new steps to limit the virus as of June 30, USA TODAY reported. In Wisconsin, new cases rose noticeably the last two weeks of June after falling steadily in the first half of the month.
The reversal has led to an increased push for mask usage and other measures to limit the spread.
But one Wisconsin lawmaker said a step like mandating masks isn't needed, pointing in part to the number of tests being conducted.
""The cases are going up, but it's because the testing is going up,"" Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, said in an interview with WISN-TV on June 29, 2020. ""The hospitalization rate is still within the comfort zone of every single hospital.""
We’ll focus on the first part of this phrase, since the interplay of testing and case trends is critical to understanding what the virus is doing in our state.
Essentially, Kapenga is blaming the increase only on the volume of tests.
Here’s why that’s wrong.
Testing isn’t going up
Wisconsin isn’t seeing a surge as significant as some states in the South, but the cases are clearly rising.
The seven-day average of new cases was around 270 in mid-June, but it rose to more than 400 by late June when Kapenga made his statement. The seven-day average is the best judge of general trends since it smooths out the daily stats, which can jump up and down for a variety of reasons.
But Kapenga’s reasoning fails on two fronts.
First, this ignores the more detailed stats that show what is actually driving the increase.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Experts say people here are letting their guard down, particularly residents in their 20s who went from 20% of the state’s positive tests before June 22 to 40% after that date. They point to the increasing willingness — in that age group and others — to get together at bars, parties and other social events. 
Contact tracing has confirmed these get-togethers as an increasingly common source of COVID-19 infections. The trend has spurred officials in Madison to order bars to close again.
Second, his basic premise is flat wrong — testing isn’t going up.
The seven-day average of daily tests in Wisconsin peaked at 12,000 on June 9 and has marched steadily downward since. The average was just over 9,000 on June 29 when Kapenga made his claim.
Throughout May, new cases and testing volume both generally rose. But the trends separated after that. And in the last half of June new cases rose as testing dropped.
The seven-day average of daily tests in Wisconsin peaked at 12,000 on June 9 and has marched steadily downward since. The average was just over 9,000 on June 29 when Kapenga made his claim.

 

In a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Kapenga said his full comments to WISN focused on hospitalizations, which have continued to drop throughout June.
""The interview was largely about face mask mandates and not a detailed analysis of testing data and trends,"" Kapenga said. ""This statement was a generality and not intended to be a commentary on any new trend beginning at that time of the interview.""

Our ruling
Addressing rising COVID-19 case counts in Wisconsin, Kapenga said measures like mandatory mask use aren’t necessary because cases are rising due to increased testing.
That’s flat wrong.
Experts say there are clear drivers to the recent uptick, like residents in their 20s largely ignoring social distancing. So Kapenga’s attempt to minimize the trend to a result of testing frequency is misguided.
Most notably, Kapenga’s core premise is simply not accurate. Testing was dropping, not rising, in late June as cases rose. He defended his claim as a ""generality,"" but it’s a generality that hasn’t been true since May.

An executive order by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer does not prohibit gardening or the sale of any particular product.

In a regular feature called ""How the Left Destroys the Nation,"" a website founded by the leader of a far-right group posted this headline about one state’s coronavirus response: 
""Michigan Governor Bans Gardening, Sale Of Fruit and Vegetable Seeds, Gardening Supplies Prohibited.""
The attack on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has been touted as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
That’s because it’s wrong. Whitmer has issued orders directing people to stay home and limiting some commercial activity, but this claim goes too far. 
The headline appears on the Geller Report, a website by Pamela Geller. She is an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative.
Below the headline is an article that originally appeared in The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning publication, that reports on an executive order issued by Whitmer in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article does not say that the order bans gardening, but that it does restrict the sale of gardening supplies.
In reality, executive order 2020-42, which went into effect April 9, 2020, requires larger stores to block off certain areas of their sales floors as a way of limiting the number of people in those stores. The order does not ban gardening or the sale of any product, including, as we mentioned in a previous fact-check, American flags.
The numbers of coronavirus cases in Michigan have surged in recent weeks. As of April 14, the Wolverine State ranked fourth — behind New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, according to the New York Times. 
Nearly half of Michigan’s cases are in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, according to Johns Hopkins University. Both the state and the county have a COVID-19 fatality rate of 6%.

It’s in that climate that Whitmer issued this order, subtitled the ""Temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life,"" which extended and added to a stay-at-home order issued March 23.
Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for the governor, told PolitiFact that Whitmer’s order does not ban Michiganders from buying any item.
The order says that stores larger than 50,000 square feet must close areas — ""by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means — that are dedicated to the following classes of goods: Carpet or flooring, furniture, garden centers and plant nurseries, and paint.""
Referring to that restriction at a news conference announcing the order, Whitmer said: ""If you’re not buying food or medicine or other essential items, you should not be going to the store.""
As to gardening, a frequently asked questions document released by the governor’s office states: ""The order does not prohibit homeowners from tending to their own yards as they see fit.""
Grocery stores, of course, remain open. And neither the order nor the FAQs mention any restriction on the sale of fruit or seeds.

If Your Time is short





Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen, 29, suddenly collapsed June 12 during a UEFA European Championship match between Denmark and Finland. He was later reported to be stable at the hospital after suffering cardiac arrest.


The director of Eriksen’s professional team said he hadn’t received any COVID-19 vaccine or previously contracted the disease.


A small number of younger people have developed heart inflammation after receiving an mRNA-based vaccine. The possible link is currently being investigated by health agencies, including the CDC.





See the sources for this fact-check




Christian Eriksen, a 29-year-old Danish soccer player, suddenly collapsed on the pitch during a June 12 European Championship match between the Denmark and Finland national teams. Tournament organizers and Denmark’s soccer federation later reported that Eriksen suffered cardiac arrest and was awake and responsive at the hospital.
It didn’t take long after Eriksen’s collapse for misinformation about his COVID-19 vaccination status to start circulating online.
An Instagram post shows a screenshot of a tweet that says: ""Christian Eriksen, the Danish player who suddenly collapsed on the pitch, plays for Inter Milan. The chief medic and cardiologist of that Italian team confirmed on an Italian radio station that Eriksen has received the Pfizer vaccine on May 31.""
The tweet, now deleted, came from Luboš Motl, a Czech physicist and blogger who has shared false information about COVID-19 and vaccines. Other tweets claimed that the station the chief medic spoke to was Radio Sportiva. 



The post isn’t accurate. Inter Milan’s director said Eriksen hadn’t received any COVID-19 vaccine prior to his collapse, or contracted the disease in the past. Radio Sportiva denied that it made any such report.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Eriksen collapsed suddenly in the 43rd minute of the Group B opener between Denmark and Finland while he was running near the left touchline after a Denmark throw-in. His teammates gathered around him before he was carried off on a stretcher. The game was paused for over an hour.
A young athlete experiencing cardiac arrest is not common, but it’s also not unprecedented.
The rumor about Eriksen came amid reports of a small but higher-than-expected number of cases of heart inflammation — called myocarditis and pericarditis — developing in mostly young people after they received doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced June 10 that it will convene an emergency meeting on June 18 to discuss a possible link between the condition and the vaccines. Other health organizations, like the European Medicines Agency, are also investigating.

But Eriksen’s collapse appears unrelated.
Motl had to take down his tweet after Inter Milan’s director Giuseppe Marotta told Italian sports TV channel Rai Sport that Eriksen hadn’t received any COVID-19 vaccine.
Radio Sportiva, meanwhile, denied that anyone on the team’s medical staff said otherwise.
""The information reported in the tweet mentioned is false,"" the radio station wrote in a June 13 tweet. We have never reported any opinion from the Inter medical staff regarding Christian Eriksen's condition.""
The Inter Milan team doctor, Piero Volpi, told Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport that Eriksen will undergo thorough examinations over the next few days. ""But there has never been an episode that even remotely hinted at a problem,"" Volpi added. 
Sanjay Sharma, Eriksen’s cardiologist while he played for former club Tottenham Hotspur, said that some players may have had mild or asymptomatic coronavirus infections, which could have resulted in ""scarring"" of the heart, but that Eriksen had no prior heart issues during his time with the Premier League. Eriksen signed with Inter Milan in January 2020.

Social media posts claim that Eriksen collapsed on the field from cardiac arrest days after receiving Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.
The director of Inter Milan, the Italian professional team Eriksen plays for, said the footballer hadn’t received any of the vaccines.
He is currently undergoing testing to pinpoint the cause.

Joe Biden","Joe Biden wrong about how early he called to invoke the Defense Production Act




If Your Time is short



• Biden was far from the first official to call for use of the Defense Production Act to boost manufacturing of urgently needed medical supplies. 
• A full 18 days before Biden made his first public comment on the act, Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary had publicly floated the idea, and Trump made it official the same day Biden made his remarks. 
• In between, dozens of Democratic lawmakers publicly called for the act to be used, and Biden did not mention it in a Democratic primary debate.

During an event to discuss school reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden repeated a talking point he’s used previously — that he was ahead of the curve in calling for the Defense Production Act to be used to boost manufacturing of high-demand health products, such as protective equipment.
In a question-and-answer session with reporters following his Sept. 2 event in Wilmington, Del., Biden said, ""When it got up to March, I kept saying, look, you’ve got to invoke, and you remember, I think I was the first — I may be mistaken — person calling about the Defense Production Act. … Use that authority. Use it to go out there now and don’t wait to talk about the need for us to have masks.""
Biden said he may be mistaken, and he is. But Biden made similar remarks in mid to late March, which our friends at FactCheck.org rated skeptically. Since he has continued to say it, we will put it on the Truth-O-Meter.
Let’s take a fresh look.
What is the Defense Production Act?
The Defense Production Act was signed by President Harry Truman in 1950 and amended periodically since then. Broadly, it allows the federal government to take a stronger role in directing domestic manufacturing capabilities during a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
These powers allow the government to tell private businesses when and how to fulfill orders for essential goods. Over the years, its scope has been expanded from military needs to natural hazards, terrorist attacks, and other national emergencies.
""The DPA is one of those seemingly obscure laws that is actually extraordinarily significant,"" Margaret O’Mara, a University of Washington historian who studies the connections between government and industry, told us in March.
A look at the timeline
The earliest discussion of using the Defense Production Act to combat the coronavirus came on Feb. 26, just three weeks after the first coronavirus death in the United States. Here’s a rundown:
Feb. 26: New York City emergency management commissioner Deanne Criswell, at a press conference with Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking about masks, said, ""There's just a long waiting list and the only way to fulfill that is by the federal government. They have means where they can enact the Defense Production Act and get people to produce these more quickly.""
Feb. 28: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a White House roundtable for the media: ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting. That is an authority that we have, and we intend to use it to acquire anything that we need to acquire. We won't use it unnecessarily, of course. We don't want to be disruptive if that's not needed. But if we need to, we will use it. We won't hesitate.""
March 1: Azar said in an appearance on Fox News Sunday, ""Right now, we are initiating the procurement processes for personal protective equipment, so that would be masks, as well as gowns, gloves, etc. We've got that process initiated. We're gathering information from potential vendors."" Asked by host Chris Wallace whether that would be using authority under the act, Azar said, ""If we need to.""
March 13: A letter from 57 House Democrats urged the president to ""use the powers afforded by"" the Defense Production Act ""to begin the mass production of supplies.""

March 15: Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., released a statement about a letter he wrote to the White House urging use of the Defense Production Act. 
March 15: During the evening Democratic debate, Biden did not mention the Defense Production Act (nor did any of the other candidates). Biden pointed to his coronavirus plan on his campaign website, but that version of the plan did not include the Defense Production Act.
March 17: At a White White House coronavirus task force press briefing, Trump himself was asked, ""Do you need to invoke the Defense Production Act to get more of those medical supplies to different hospitals across the country?"" He answered, ""Well, we're able to do that if we have to. Right now we haven't had to, but it's certainly ready.""
March 18: In the first statement we could locate by Biden on the issue, he released a statement urging the administration to ""prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis — such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate — by invoking the Defense Production Act.""
March 18: Trump signed an executive order citing the authority of the act to curb the spread of coronavirus. He specifically mentioned Title I, part of which involves prioritizing contracts that serve national emergency goals over any other contracts or orders. Trump’s executive order specifically named ""personal protective equipment and ventilators."" 
Later that day, Trump indicated a certain reluctance in a tweet. ""I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!""
Biden’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry seeking earlier comments by the candidate about the Defense Production Act.
It’s worth noting that while several contracts have been awarded under the act’s authority, critics have said that Trump hasn’t used the Defense Production Act to its fullest extent. Several experts made this case to the New York Times in late July.
Trump has not used the act ""to create a permanent, sustainable, redundant, domestic supply chain for all things pandemic: testing, swabs, N95 masks, etc.,"" Jamie Baker, a former legal adviser to the National Security Council and a professor of national security law at Syracuse University, told the Times.
Still, even if Biden agrees that Trump’s follow-through has been weak, it doesn’t mean that he was the first official to call for the Defense Production Act to be used.
Our ruling
Biden has said several times he was the first person calling for use of the Defense Production Act. 
But Biden was far from the first. A full 18 days before Biden made his first public comment on the act, Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary had publicly floated the idea, and Trump made it official the same day Biden made his remarks. In between, dozens of Democratic lawmakers publicly called for the act to be used, and Biden did not mention it in a Democratic primary debate.

A website with ties to Steve Bannon and a Chinese billionaire is claiming to have a scoop on the source of the coronavirus.
In an article published Jan. 25, G News wrote that Chinese Communist Party officials would soon ""admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from ‘a lab in Wuhan (China)’ linked to its covert biological weapon programs.""
""A reliable source told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an ‘accidental’ leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on ‘human errors,’"" the article reads. ""But the official announcement is still being finalized.""
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times.

The coronavirus, which originated in the central China city of Wuhan, has infected more than 2,700 people worldwide, according to a Jan. 27 World Health Organization report. China has restricted travel within the country amid a rising death toll.
While we can’t know who G News has or hasn’t spoken to, we could find no evidence to support the website’s story.

Miles Guo, also known as Guo Wengui, is a Chinese billionaire and political activist. He fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party. Since then, Wengui, who is a member of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has become known for his outspoken criticism of Chinese efforts to weed out corruption.
G News is the media arm of Guo Media, a company linked to Wengui. Axios reported in October that the company paid Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, at least $1 million for ""strategic consulting services."" Both Bannon and Wengui have their own sections on G News.
We could find no other media reports that corroborate G News’ story about the source of the coronavirus.
There is a lab near Wuhan that deals with dangerous pathogens — and some have linked it to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the U.S. State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons.
Officials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus.
Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."" The disease appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States. Researchers believe the current outbreak pattern suggests the coronavirus may have spread from animal to human at first, and now from human to human.

TikTok posts","No, video doesn’t prove AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contains Bluetooth chip




If Your Time is short





The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine does not include ingredients that would cause a recipient’s body to connect to Bluetooth-enabled smartphones and other devices.





See the sources for this fact-check




A debunked claim from the early days of the pandemic — that the COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips — is spreading anew online, courtesy of a TikTok video circulating across platforms.
""AstraZeneca Bluetooth side effect,"" says the text on the two-part TikTok video, which shows a man who claims that his body has been connecting to Bluetooth-enabled devices ever since he got the AstraZeneca shot. One hashtag on the video: ""#chipped.""
The ingredients for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine are publicly available online, including on government websites where the vaccine is approved for use, such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. (The vaccine has not been authorized for emergency use in the U.S.)
It does not contain anything related to Bluetooth technology or microchips. PolitiFact has fact-checked several claims alleging that the vaccines contain microchips, all inaccurate.
Yet, the viral TikTok video has been reposted to Instagram, YouTube and other platforms.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The video doesn’t prove what it claims to
Conspiracy theories about microchips in the COVID-19 vaccines have been so persistent that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed them in a vaccine safety FAQ.
""There may be trackers on the vaccine shipment boxes to protect them from theft, but there are no trackers in the vaccines themselves,"" the agency wrote.
This two-part TikTok video adds a new wrinkle to the false narrative, with the man in the video claiming his body is connecting to Bluetooth-enabled devices as a result of the vaccine.
In the first part of the video, the man sits at a counter and talks about the side effects he felt after getting his vaccine. The camera focuses on his smartphone, which then shows a notification for a ""Bluetooth pairing request"" from a device titled ""AstraZeneca_ChAdOx1-S.""
""The only problem is that everywhere I go, everywhere I go, everything is trying to connect to me now, like Bluetooth connectivity,"" the man says before showing his phone. ""I got Bluetooth connectivity. I get in the car, my car is trying to connect to me. I go home, my computer is trying to connect. My phone is trying to connect. Like everything, all the time.""

In the second part of the video, the man is sitting at the same counter but wearing a different outfit. He approaches a TV, and the TV says, ""Connecting to AstraZeneca_ChAdOx1-S.""
But the TikTok video doesn’t prove what it claims to. 
First, Bluetooth-enabled devices can typically be renamed as the user sees fit, and any other device could be triggering the notifications in the video.
Second, microchips are too big to fit into the COVID-19 shots.
""A microchip is about 0.5 inches long,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. ""That wouldn’t fit through the end of a needle.""
The video resembles other recent postings by social media users who claimed, falsely, that they were able to stick magnets to their arms because of microchips in the vaccines. 
As PolitiFact and other fact-checkers reported, there’s nothing magnetic or metallic in the vaccines. ""It’s protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH,"" Thomas Hope, a vaccine researcher at Northwestern University, told AFP. ""That’s basically it.
AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment.
Our ruling
A TikTok video claims the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contains a Bluetooth microchip.
There’s no support for that claim. The ingredients for the AstraZeneca vaccine do not include Bluetooth technology. Claims that the vaccines contain microchips have been widely debunked. 
What’s more, Bluetooth enabled devices can be renamed as users see fit — and there’s no evidence the man’s body is responsible for the notifications shown in the video.

The Kennedy Center and a nonprofit that funds PBS received money from the $2 trillion federal stimulus law in response to the coronavirus.


Both Kennedy and PBS are nonprofits that are prohibited by law from making political donations. Federal election records show they have not made any such donations.

When it came to the $2 trillion relief package for COVID-19, maybe few things fueled more political criticism than the $25 million that went to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
Some Republicans blasted the earmark as federal largesse.
But worse than the Kennedy money are coronavirus kickbacks that followed, claimed a post shared 54,000 times on Facebook.
""So, the virus bill gives $25 million to the Kennedy Center (and) $200 million to PBS,"" the post says, referring to the Public Broadcasting Service. ""In return, the Kennedy Center donates $5 million to the Democratic Party and PBS donates $25 million to the Democratic Party. This is flat-out money laundering and quid pro quo. Prove me wrong."" 
With apologies, we will.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Kennedy Center and PBS
The Kennedy Center opened in Washington, D.C., in 1971, eight years after the assassination of the 35th president for whom it is named. It is home to the National Symphony Orchestra and the Washington National Opera. Among its most celebrated moments is the late Aretha Franklin’s performance of ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"" in 2015.
PBS is a private nonprofit owned by its more than 330 member public television stations and serves as an alternative to commercial broadcasting. It is funded mainly by those stations and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit created and funded by the federal government that manages federal funding for public media. The children’s show ""Sesame Street"" (which moved to HBO after 45 years) and the dramatic series ""Masterpiece"" (formerly ""Masterpiece Theatre"") are among PBS’ most popular shows.
The stimulus law
The largest of the coronavirus stimulus packages adopted into law so far is the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was enacted March 27. 
""Keeping workers paid and employed, health care system enhancements and economic stabilization"" are the primary aims of the overall bill. 
Features include payments of $1,200 per individual, subject to income limits, a $600 bonus added to weekly unemployment insurance checks and forgivable loans for small businesses to help them meet their payrolls. 
The Kennedy and PBS money
The $25 million in CARES money for the Kennedy Center is for such purposes as ""deep cleaning,"" maintenance, telework upgrades, employee compensation, rent and utilities. The center is a federal entity funded by ticket revenue and congressional appropriations, so receiving funding through a congressional bill isn’t unusual.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







The Democratic House leadership had said in a statement that the Kennedy Center had lost more than $20 million in unrecoverable costs from canceled performances and could ""become completely insolvent and potentially unable to reopen.""
Because of COVID-19, the Kennedy Center closed March 12 and has canceled performances through at least May 22.
Meanwhile, it was the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS, and not PBS itself, that received $75 million in CARES funding — not $200 million. It is for ""stabilization support"" for stations seeing declines in non-federal revenues. 
As with the Kennedy Center, it is standard practice for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to receive its funding from congressional legislation.
""Public media stations are the backbone for most communities’ emergency alert, public safety, first-responder and homeland-security services,"" the same Democratic leadership statement said. ""If stations are forced to cut jobs, reduce content and services, or close, the nation’s ability to deliver emergency alerts will be significantly diminished.""
Kennedy Center, PBS can’t donate
There actually isn’t a legal way for the Kennedy Center or PBS to show their appreciation for politicians through campaign contributions.
Because the Kennedy Center and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and tax-exempt organization with the Internal Revenue Service, they are prohibited from making political contributions. 
501(c)(3) is the section of the Internal Revenue Code that applies to charitable organizations that can receive tax-deductible donations. Aside from donating, they cannot attempt to influence legislation ""as a substantial part of its activities"" and cannot participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.
Fact-checkers Lead Stories, Snopes and FactCheck.org each reported that the Kennedy Center did not make a $5 million donation. So did the Reuters news agency.
Our search of Federal Election Commission records also show no political contributions at all being made by the Kennedy Center or the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or PBS.
We also checked the Federal Election Commission records for any contributions made by employees of those three entities on or after March 27, the day President Donald Trump signed the CARES bill into law. We didn’t find any.
Our ruling
A Facebook post shared more than 54,0000 times claimed that the Kennedy Center gave $25 million and the corporation that funds PBS gave $5 million to the Democratic Party after the two entities received millions from a federal stimulus law in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Both nonprofits are barred by law from making political contributions and we found no evidence that they have.

A few days before Lewis died, Obama tweeted that ""voting by mail shouldn’t be a partisan issue — especially during a pandemic."" He said ""everybody should be able to request an absentee ballot and make their voice heard in every election."" But he didn’t raise that issue during his eulogy.

Social media users are misinterpreting a federal disaster relief law to promote a hoax about a nationwide quarantine.
A Facebook post published March 16 includes a screenshot of another post from a page called Ninety Degree Turns. It claims that President Donald Trump will soon lock down the entire country to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which had infected 4,226 people in the United States as of March 17.
""Please be advised, within 48 to 72 Hours the president will evoke (sic) what is called the Stafford act,"" reads the post. ""Just got off the phone with some of my military friends down in DC who had a two hour briefing. The president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
The screenshot is similar to a chain message that claims to have information from ""my friend’s aunt"" who works for the federal government. We rated that message False.
This Facebook post is wrong, and it gives the wrong impression about the Stafford Act.
There is no evidence that the federal government is set to announce a nationwide lockdown like the ones seen in France, Italy and Spain. Trump and the National Security Council have both refuted the claim.
So far, officials have advised Americans to practice ""social distancing,"" or avoiding crowded public spaces.
In a press conference March 16, Trump outlined several recommendations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Among them is avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.

The Facebook post also says Trump will soon invoke the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. That part is accurate — the president announced the move in a letter to Cabinet officials on March 13 — but it doesn’t mean there will be nationwide quarantine.
""COVID-19 has the potential to impose a temporary financial hardship on all Americans,"" Trump wrote. ""It is therefore critical that we deploy all powers and authorities available to the Federal Government to provide needed relief.""
""Therefore, as an initial step, I hereby determine, under section 501(b) of the Stafford Act, that an emergency exists nationwide.""
The move activates the Federal Emergency Management Agency, authorizes aid to state and local governments, and waives certain regulations that impede access to health care. The Stafford Act is commonly used during hurricanes and does not necessitate a nationwide lockdown.
Meanwhile, some places around the country have taken matters into their own hands.
In New Rochelle, N.Y., Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a one-mile containment zone on March 10. In the San Francisco Bay Area, local officials on March 16 announced sweeping measures to try to contain the coronavirus, including a ""shelter in place"" order for residents in six counties. That order is among the strictest in the country, although it fell short of a total lockdown.

While the majority of Germans support COVID restrictions, the majority of project participants did not.


Parents used subjective criteria to describe their childrens’ reactions.

An Instagram post from the operator of a website selling supplements is a great example of how not to use data.
The post says masks to reduce the spread of COVID have ""major negative impacts"" on 68% of children.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The claim’s source is a report out of Germany based on online submissions of childrens’ reactions to wearing masks. In the span of one week in October 2020, about 20,000 people had entered data on nearly 26,000 children.
The tally is unsettling:
""Impairments caused by wearing the mask were reported by 68% of the parents. These included irritability (60%), headache (53%), difficulty concentrating (50%), less happiness (49%), reluctance to go to school/kindergarten (44%), malaise (42%) impaired learning (38%) and drowsiness or fatigue (37%).""
Now, let’s look at why that doesn’t mean nearly as much as it might seem at first blush. (Hat tip to Health Feedback for their work on this.)
First, while the number of respondents is high, that says nothing about whether they are representative of the German population. Participation was based solely on personal preference. There’s evidence to suggest the group was heavily skewed toward people who were mask skeptics.

The German research paper said that about 42% of respondents thought the German government had gone too far in its efforts to stop the spread of COVID, and another 31% said the policies were inappropriate or incomprehensible.
But a random poll in August found that only 10% of the German public thought the government’s rules were over the top. A large majority — 77% — said stricter controls were needed.
The other key flaw in the post is that it assumes all of the negative results — which themselves are subject to interpretation — were caused by the wearing of masks. There was no effort to standardize the description of the kids’ reactions, and no control group.
Some of the children might have always been reluctant to go to kindergarten. Some of them might always have had trouble concentrating.
Without standards on capturing data on how the children reacted, and without a matched group of children who didn’t wear masks, there’s no way to say that the masks caused the children’s reactions.
The result is a jumble of numbers, not valid data.

Donald Trump","Trump wrong that hydroxychloroquine studies only gave drug to dying patients




If Your Time is short





Trump spoke as though there was only one study that found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine, and said it only looked at people “that were in very bad shape,” almost dead.


There have been three studies, and all found no link between hydroxychloroquine and reduced deaths.


All studies filtered out the impact of underlying health problems.





See the sources for this fact-check




Count President Donald Trump as hydroxychloroquine’s No. 1 fan.
At a press conference, Trump told reporters he’s putting his health where his mouth is.
""Couple of weeks ago I started taking it,"" he said May 18. ""Because I think it’s good. I’ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you right. I’m not going to get hurt by it.""
To be clear, the Food and Drug Administration cautions that hydroxychloroquine can hurt people. It increases the risk of an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to cardiac arrest. 
Trump didn’t mention that. He did, however, dismiss the research that cast doubt on whether the drug does any good against COVID-19.
""If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,"" Trump said at a May 19 press event. ""They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.""
Later that day, Trump clarified that he was talking about a study of Veterans Administration patients. 
Trump spoke as if there were only one negative study. There have been three: the one on VA patients and two larger ones. They all reached the same conclusion that outcomes with hydroxychloroquine were the same as without it. 
The studies
The earliest work on hydroxychloroquine was small studies, sometimes with as few as 30 patients, and for each study that showed promise, another study found no benefit. The mixed results spurred more research.
The analysis Trump criticized came in late April, when researchers at the universities of South Carolina and Virginia released their paper on 368 VA patients with COVID-19. They looked at who got hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or both, and they tracked who ended up on a ventilator or died. The paper was released without peer review. 
They found that hydroxychloroquine, with or without the other drug, had no effect on whether someone had to be put on a ventilator. Worse, hydroxychloroquine increased the chances of dying.
The authors cautioned that all of the patients involved in the study, regardless of outcome, were men over 65. And they also factored in a range of underlying conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and other health risks. Those issues were found in roughly equal numbers across all groups of patients. Ultimately, about 75% of the patients getting hydroxychloroquine lived. The survival rate was close to 90% for those who didn’t get it.
Trump ignores larger, newer studies
In early May, two studies emerged based on patients treated in the nation’s biggest COVID-19 hotspot, New York City. Both investigations were much larger than the study of VA patients.
The study that appeared May 7 in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the medical records of 1,376 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. Their results echoed the first study on hydroxychloroquine.

""There was no association between administration of the drug and a lower chance of dying or winding up on a respirator,"" said co-author Neil Schluger, the head of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
Now, it’s fair to say that the patients who got the drug were, as a group, a bit worse off than those who didn’t. In particular, their blood oxygen levels were lower when they were first admitted. Schluger said that didn’t matter.
""The difference in oxygen levels between the two groups we compared were fairly small and not clinically important,"" Schluger said. 
These patients were not close to death, Schluger said.
""Overall, about 83% of the patients in our cohort survived, and that survival had no association with hydroxychloroquine administration,"" he said.
On May 11, the JAMA Network of the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study of 1,438 randomly selected COVID-19 patients treated at 25 New York area hospitals. That group of researchers tracked whether they died in the hospital. They, too, found no connection between outcomes and use of hydroxychloroquine. They also found no impact from the use of another drug, azithromycin. About 75% of patients getting hydroxychloroquine survived, compared with about 87% who were not given the drug.
Like the other study, this one found that patients who got the drug were in worse health at admission than those who didn’t. They might have lower oxygen levels, or some other condition such as diabetes or obesity. 
But by examining patients’ full medical records, both teams were able to use stronger analytic tools to filter out the impact of differences in underlying health. Once that was done, they could make apples-to-apples comparisons of the effect of hydroxychloroquine on people who got the drug and those who didn’t.
The authors of all studies acknowledged that working with patient records after the fact isn’t the final answer, and they called for more research.
We reached out to the White House and did not hear back.
Our ruling
Trump spoke about ""the one survey,"" a study of VA patients and hydroxychloroquine, and said it was ""bad"" because ""they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old. Almost dead.""
There have been three studies, not just one. None of them found that the drug reduced the death toll.
As a group, the patients getting the drug were not on the verge of death. Across three studies, about 75% to 80% of the patients receiving the drug survived. 
To say they were in very bad shape is also off the mark. Health issues were found in members of both the treatment and non-treatment groups. That allowed researchers to tease out the impact, and make informed comparisons that took these health differences into account.

The White House will direct state, local and tribal governments to make all American adults eligible to register for COVID-19 vaccines by May 1, President Joe Biden announced March 11.
In a primetime address delivered hours after he signed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill into law, Biden said his goal is to make small-group gatherings possible by July 4. He encouraged Americans to get vaccinated and follow public health guidelines to make that happen.

But the president did not say he would mandate that everybody get the vaccine, despite what one conservative commentator said in a Facebook live video reacting to the address.
""Now he is promoting, what sounds like to me, as mandatory vaccines for everybody, and then we could maybe celebrate the Fourth of July in small groups,"" David J. Harris Jr., a supporter of former President Donald Trump, said before showing clips from Biden’s address.

Harris Jr. did not respond to a request for comment sent via his Facebook page. But his video distorts what Biden said about scaling up vaccine availability.

""Tonight, I'm announcing that I will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults, people 18 and over, eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again. All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That's much earlier than expected. Let me be clear, that doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.""
Biden promised a new website to help people find vaccines near them, and he said additional guidance would be coming on what vaccinated people can and can’t do.
Then, he urged ""every American to do their part"" to ""beat this virus,"" saying:

That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.""
Biden said the shots are safe, noting that he and Vice President Kamala Harris got theirs in front of cameras. ""We need everyone to get vaccinated,"" he said.
But the president never said he was mandating that everyone get a vaccine.
The federal government’s ability to impose vaccination requirements is limited, although states have some authority to do so, PolitiFact previously reported. Biden, like Trump before him, has not announced plans to make the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory.
""No, I don’t think it should be mandatory,"" Biden said in December. ""I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who Biden implored Americans to ""listen to"" during his address, has also said he does not support mandating vaccines, although he told Newsweek he expects certain institutions like hospitals to require vaccinations. 
The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Michael Schraa","Wisconsin GOP lawmaker wrong that masks have been ""proven ineffective"" against COVID-19




If Your Time is short





A growing body of evidence shows that wearing a mask, even a cloth mask, can reduce transmission of COVID-19 


Schraa shared links to unreputable sources that found masks ineffective, while leading medical journals, federal and world health officials, research universities and President Donald Trump have said masks do work to cut down transmission





See the sources for this fact-check




As coronavirus cases climb in Wisconsin, more and more face mask policies have been put into effect. Some apply to specific settings, such as stores or government-owned buildings, others more universally, such as in Dane County and the cities of Milwaukee and Green Bay. 
Indeed, on July 30, 2020, Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide mask order.
Most mask mandates have come with exceptions, such as for young children and people whose medical conditions may make it unsafe to wear one. 
Opponents argue mask mandates endanger personal freedoms, that wearing a mask can cause carbon dioxide poisoning (an idea that has been debunked by scientists) and that some types of face coverings won’t do anything to stop transmission of the coronavirus. 
State Rep. Michael Schraa, R-Oshkosh, voiced that theory in an interview with the Oshkosh Northwestern on July 24, 2020, after sharing links to sources on Facebook that suggest masks do not work as they are intended. His comments come as the city of Oshkosh weighs a mandate on masks in public spaces. 
""If you think the government should be mandating us wearing masks that are proven ineffective just for the sake of giving a false sense of security for people, what else are you going to agree to?"" Schraa told the Northwestern. 
Is Schraa correct when he claims that wearing masks has been ""proven ineffective""?
No. 
Let’s take a look.
New guidance to match a new virus 
When asked for backup, spokeswoman Linda Palmer said the comment was aimed at whether governments should be allowed to mandate masks, and that ""he did not make a direct statement that all masks are always totally ineffective."" 
But Schraa did say — here and in other forums — that he believed masks weren’t effective. In conversations on his Facebook page, he linked to articles stating that masks do not prevent transmission of viruses. 
It’s important to note that, at one point, federal health officials were not recommending that everyone wear masks, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began advising widespread mask use in April and hasn’t changed its stance since. 
Critics often use that reversal to argue against the effectiveness of masks. 
But because this is a novel virus, the CDC, the medical community and everyday Americans alike are learning about it at the same time — and as more evidence emerged about how many asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus, guidance on who should wear masks shifted with it.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







(The CDC now estimates that 40% of infections could be among people who feel perfectly healthy.)
Do masks protect others from you? 
If you’re not a health care worker, you’re likely wearing a cloth mask instead of an N95 respirator, which filters the large majority of airborne particles and thus protects the wearer and the people around them. 
The role of the cloth mask is largely that of source control — that is, to prevent you from transmitting the virus to others if you are infected. 
A growing body of evidence supports the idea that a cloth face covering will cut down on COVID-19 transmission. This includes: 


A review of 172 studies worldwide from the medical journal The Lancet found that face mask use could result in ""a large reduction"" in risk of infection


A study of Mass General Brigham, the largest health care system in Massachusetts, found that rates of positivity among workers dropped after a universal mask policy was implemented 


Researchers at Texas A&M University compared trends in China, Italy and New York City and found that wearing a face mask reduced the number of infections by tens of thousands in Italy and New York


A laboratory study that visualized droplets with laser lighting as people spoke found that the trajectory of the droplets nearly disappeared when the person wore a face covering 


A CDC study that found two Missouri hairdressers who wore masks while working with clients and diagnosed with COVID-19 shortly after did not pass the virus on to any of the clients who had been exposed 


What about the other way around? Do masks protect you from others? For cloth mask wearers, research is less clear on this front, but evidence is growing here, too. 
For example, a new paper led by a professor at the University of California, San Francisco and set to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine asserts that people wearing a mask will take in fewer coronavirus particles, making it easier for their immune systems to seek out and stamp out the ones that do get in. 
As evidence about masks reducing infections has grown, leaders who previously decried their use have now shifted their tone. In Texas, for example, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott instituted a statewide mask mandate as cases spiked after previously resisting such an order. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, issued a similar mandate in July, after saying in May that a statewide order wouldn’t work. And President Donald Trump, another Republican, endorsed masks on July 21 after months of critiquing their use.
The sources Schraa has linked to in online conversations about mask usage include stories from SOTT.net, which has landed on a list of sites found to be publishing misinformation about the coronavirus, and a video featuring an Infowars host on the website banned.video. 
The sources that back up claims of mask effectiveness, stem from large research universities, prominent labs and medical journals, and the CDC. 
Our rating 
In a critique of local governments’ ability to require people to wear masks, Schraa said that masks are ""proven ineffective"" at cutting down transmission of the coronavirus. 
But a growing number of studies — and a growing consensus among leaders, including President Trump — have shown the opposite to be true.
We rate the claim False.

Bloggers","Don’t fall for conspiracy about Dr. Anthony Fauci, hydroxychloroquine




If Your Time is short





An article published by a website run by an anti-LGBTQ political organization claims Dr. Anthony Fauci knew in 2005 that hydroxychloroquine was effective against human coronaviruses.


The article cites a 2005 study that found a related drug, chloroquine, could inhibit the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.


There is no known treatment, cure or vaccine for the novel coronavirus or SARS. While some early research suggests hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID-19 symptoms, other studies have found no discernible effect





See the sources for this fact-check




A widely shared conspiracy theory on Facebook alleges that Dr. Anthony Fauci is knowingly advocating against a treatment for the novel coronavirus. 
An April 27 article says the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has known since 2005 that hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat conditions like lupus and arthritis, is effective against coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19.  
""Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose ‘expert’ advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses,"" reads the article. ""How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director.""
The source of the article is One News Now, a website operated by the American Family Association, a Christian fundamentalist nonprofit founded by Mississippi pastor Donald Wildmon. The Southern Poverty Law Center has classified the political organization as an anti-LGBTQ hate group.
One News Now’s article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 27,000 times.

Despite being one of the most trusted coronavirus experts in the United States, Fauci has been the target of several conspiracy theories about his handling of the pandemic — particularly since he tempered expectations for hydroxychloroquine during a March press conference. So we wanted to check out this article, too.
There are several things wrong with the One News Now story. 
First: The article relies on a 2005 study about the effect of chloroquine on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, more commonly called SARS. Chloroquine is chemically similar to hydroxychloroquine, but it is a different drug and is primarily used to treat malaria. Both drugs pose risks for people with heart problems.
The One News Now story claims the journal that published the study is ""the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health."" That’s inaccurate.
While the 2005 study has been indexed by the NIH’s National Library of Medicine, it was published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal. The journal is produced by BioMed Central, a United Kingdom-based for-profit publisher. The study’s authors worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, and the study was funded by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
We reached out to the NIH for more context, but we haven’t heard back.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Second: The study does not suggest that hydroxychloroquine could be effective at treating or preventing COVID-19, as One News Now claims.
""HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine,"" the website wrote. ""In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus.""
This is inaccurate — there is no cure or vaccine for SARS or the novel coronavirus. While some studies have found that hydroxychloroquine could mitigate some of the symptoms associated with COVID-19, other research has found no such effect. With more than 50 studies in the works, as well as an NIH clinical trial, it’s too soon to say whether the drug is a viable treatment for the coronavirus.
The 2005 study found that chloroquine — not hydroxychloroquine — was ""effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV,"" the official name for SARS. The research was conducted in ""cell culture conditions,"" meaning the drug was not administered to actual SARS patients. The authors wrote that more research was needed on how the drug interacts with SARS in animal test subjects.
""Cell culture testing of an antiviral drug against the virus is only the first step, of many steps, necessary to develop an antiviral drug,"" said Kate Fowlie, a press officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an email. ""It is important to realize that most antivirals that pass this cell culture test hurdle fail at later steps in the development process.""
RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know
Finally: Fauci could not have known in 2005 that hydroxychloroquine was a potential treatment for COVID-19. Available evidence shows that the novel coronavirus first emerged in Hubei Province, China, in November.
While the novel coronavirus is similar to SARS in some respects — both are human coronaviruses that originated in bats, cause respiratory illness and spread through coughs and sneezes — they are different diseases. COVID-19 has infected more than 3.5 million people worldwide compared to the 8,000 who were sickened during the 2003 SARS outbreak. While SARS cases are generally more severe, scientists believe that COVID-19 is more transmissible.
As One News Now notes, the novel coronavirus and SARS have a 79% genetic similarity and use the same ""host cell receptor,"" meaning they infect people in similar ways. But that doesn’t mean the findings of the 2005 study apply to COVID-19.
""Whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are of value for treating infections with the different, but related, SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot be answered by the data in the 2005 study,"" Fowlie said.
Our ruling
One News Now wrote that Fauci ""has known for 15 years that chloroquine and … hydroxychloroquine will not only treat a current case of coronavirus but prevent future cases.""
The website cited a study that has to do with SARS, not the novel coronavirus. It was published in 2005 in Virology Journal, which is not the ""official publication"" of the NIH. 
While the study found that chloroquine helped inhibit the spread of SARS in cell cultures, those results do not suggest that the drug is an effective treatment for SARS or COVID-19. As of now, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for either coronavirus.

Instagram posts","Putin didn’t threaten jail time for coronavirus lockdown violators




If Your Time is short



• Russian President Vladimir Putin has implemented some policies to cancel large gatherings and keep people at home during the coronavirus pandemic. But we could not find any evidence that he has threatened jail time for people who don’t comply.
• The claim about a Putin policy to jail those who don’t stay at home appears to come from a post by the Twitter account of an Indian comedian, who later labeled his assertion a “joke.”



See the sources for this fact-check




As many Americans grapple with the new reality of sheltering in place, social media posts have pointed to a purportedly stark choice in Russia.
A March 23 Instagram post said, ""Putin has stated: Russian citizens (have) 2 options: Stay home for 15 days or in jail for 5 years.""
 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Is this something Putin said, or did? No.
The idea appears to stem from a tweet by an Indian comedian whose account goes by the name Nasir Chinioti.
The tweet says, ""#Covid_19 #StayAtHome Vladimir Putin has given Russians two options. You stay at home for 2 weeks or you go to jail for 5 years. No middle ground.""
Two days later, the author of the original post tweeted, ""Just joke,"" with three emojis. (Oddly, many social media posts circulating didn’t include the second part of the tweet, even though it’s even more eye-catching: ""RUSSIA: Vladimir Putin has Dropped 800 tigers and Lions all over the Country to push people to stay home..

An executive order signed by Whitmer that went into effect mid-April prohibited people from traveling between two residences. Although she has extended her stay-at-home order through June 12, the provision banning travel to second homes within the state has been dropped.
""Michiganders may travel between their residences, but I still strongly discourage people from doing so unless it is absolutely necessary,"" Whitmer said in late April. ""We ask that you consider not doing that.""
Whitmer lives in the governor’s mansion in Lansing, but her primary residence is in East Lansing, according to her 2018 financial disclosure. The document also lists a ""family lake house"" in Elk Rapids, a town in northern Michigan.

A May 20 article from the Gateway Pundit appears to back up Bishop’s claim that Whitmer’s family spent the afternoon at their lake house. The conservative website researched the license plate on the black Chevrolet Tahoe in the photo and found that it belongs to Marc Mallory, Whitmer’s husband.
""Gretchen and Marc were at their summer home today,"" the Gateway Pundit wrote.
That’s inaccurate, according to the Michigan governor’s office.
""The governor was in Midland to tour the devastating flood damage and meet with first responders as they evacuated thousands of people to safety,"" a spokeswoman told PolitiFact in an email. ""She then returned to her home in Lansing.""
Media reports confirm that Whitmer spent May 20 in Midland. The next day, she held a press conference in Lansing about the state’s coronavirus response.
There is some evidence that Mallory could have been at the couple’s home in Elk Rapids.
Using public records searches and Google Earth, we confirmed that the car in the Facebook photo belongs to Mallory and the house is the family’s property on Birch Lake. 
The Detroit News reported that the owner of NorthShore Dock LLC, a company near Birch Lake, said in Facebook posts that Mallory had called to try to get his boat in the water before Memorial Day weekend. The posts, which have since been deleted, attracted the ire of Republican state lawmakers, who say Whitmer’s family may not be following her own stay-at-home guidance.
We asked the governor’s office about the veracity of the Facebook posts, but we haven’t heard back. Whitmer said Tuesday that Mallory’s call to the dock company, during which he asked if his status as the governor’s husband would help get his boat in the water, was a joke.
""He thought it might get a laugh,"" Whitmer said. ""It didn't, and to be honest I wasn't laughing either when it was relayed to me because I knew how it would be perceived.""
Regardless, there is no evidence that Whitmer spent the afternoon of May 20 at her house in Elk Rapids. And even if she did, it would not have violated her current stay-at-home order.

The claimed surge in cases was based on poor data work.


The upward “trend” treated a dip in new cases due to lower testing as a baseline, rather than the outlier it was.


State health officials say they haven’t yet seen evidence the election changed the trajectory of coronavirus in Wisconsin.


Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have actually dropped in Wisconsin since April 13 — the date cited in the story.





See the sources for this fact-check





Wisconsin’s mid-pandemic election was a unique spectacle.
The courtroom drama preceding the vote — and Wisconsin’s status as the only state with a primary election around this time that didn’t delay or cancel in-person voting — drew national attention and criticism.
The fundamental question was simple: What would this do to the state’s coronavirus trends? Though polling places attempted to institute social distancing, voters said it was impossible to maintain at all times, particularly in Milwaukee and Green Bay where masses of voters were shuttled through just a handful of locations.
A few people have tried to answer this question in the time since, including an April 17, 2020, article shared widely on Facebook. The story claimed ""immense consequences"" from in-person voting, with this headline:
""New Virus Cases Surge in Wisconsin a Week After Republicans Forced In-Person Election to Go Forward.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Have confirmed coronavirus cases really surged after the in-person election?
No, they haven’t. At least not yet. Here’s what we found. 
Claim based on flawed data work
The article, posted by the website Second Nexus, pulled its sole statistical evidence from a tweet by Topher Spiro, a health policy analyst with more than 100,000 followers on Twitter.
He posted a chart showing a dip in the number of positive cases on April 13, followed by increases each of the next three days. The accompanying text said, ""Check out the uptick in transmission the GOP caused by forcing an in-person election in Wisconsin.""
People who contract COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, typically don’t start showing symptoms for about five days. A study of 181 cases in China found the median incubation period — time before symptoms show — was five days, and only 1% first showed symptoms after 14 days (hence the standard 14-day quarantine).
Spiro and the Second Nexus story are starting with a point a week after the April 7 election and saying the increase in new cases is connected. 
But there are several critical data errors here.
First, calling the post-April 13 increase a trend assumes that April 13 is a valid baseline. If the state had been at the April 13 level for some time, then an increase from that level could be proof of a new trend.
But that’s not what happened.
April 13 was a very unusual day for coronavirus testing. The state administered an average of 1,600 coronavirus tests daily in the first three weeks of April. But on April 13 it administered only 940 — 400 less than any other day.
Predictably, with fewer tests came fewer positive results, and a large dip in the number of new confirmed cases.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021








The rise in the days after — identified by the story as proof of the election impact — was actually just a result of the number of tests growing to 1,355, then 1,495, then 1,802 the four days after April 13. Before and after that date, the percentage of tests that came back positive remained about the same: between 9% and 10%
When presented with this data, Spiro deleted his tweet.
""It looks like testing has increased since April 13 and the positive rate has remained roughly constant,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.
What’s really happening
The truth is, at the time of the Second Nexus article — and this one — it’s too soon to say what impact the election had on Wisconsin’s coronavirus outbreak.
But so far there is no sign of an increase, said Andrea Palm, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. In the state’s daily coronavirus briefing on April 20, 2020, she also noted the time between contracting the disease and being a confirmed case involves more than just the five-day median incubation time.
""I think folks do need to remember sort of the progression of this virus, from infection to symptoms to the conversation with your physician to the test to the test results,"" Palm said. ""It’s not surprising that we have not seen … a large uptick from in-person voting.""
RELATED: Tracking coronavirus in Wisconsin
If we look closer at the data before and after April 13, we see the state has so far seen no change in the frequency of new cases.
The state averaged 153 new cases per day the week before April 13, and 153 the week after. The percentage of tests coming back positive remained relatively consistent throughout that span.
And the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 actually dropped, from 431 on April 13 to about 360 every day from April 17-20.

That’s not to say the election had no impact. There have been reports of infection potentially linked to the election.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported April 20 that seven people appear to have contracted COVID-19 through activities related to the April 7 election. Six are voters, and one is a poll worker.
It’s too soon to say if there will be more, or if they in turn infected others. We don’t even know for sure that polling places are where those seven were infected.
But that certainly doesn’t constitute a ""surge.""
Our ruling
An article shared widely on Facebook claimed on April 17, 2020, that Wisconsin coronavirus cases had surged as a result of the in-person election.
That’s not the case.
The data the article cited failed to factor in a drop in the number of tests administered. It wrongly treated an unusually low number of cases on April 13 as a baseline against which to compare the following days’ new cases. The increase cited was in fact connected to an increased number of tests in the following days.
We don’t know for sure what impact the election may prove to have, but we do know it’s wrong to say a surge has already surfaced.

Measures taken during public health emergencies broadly pass legal muster but some elements face legal challenges.

House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., called it ""the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I've ever heard."" 
As fact-checkers, we looked at whether recent public health-driven restrictions on businesses and public gatherings exceeded the harm of other episodes in America’s past.
Compared, for example, to the denial of voting rights to millions of Black Americans, we found Barr’s claim fell short.
His depiction of the COVID-19 restrictions also seemed exaggerated.
Stay-at-home orders
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 44 states plus Washington, D.C. issued some form of stay-at-home order as the pandemic hit the nation. Generally, those orders shut offices, restaurants, bars and any other business judged to be nonessential. 
States enjoy broad legal authority to protect the general welfare. In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court laid down a standard that still applies today. So long as the state’s restrictions have a substantive connection to public health, they tend to pass legal muster.
That said, opponents of Pennsylvania’s stay-at-home orders won at least a temporary victory when a federal judge ruled major portions of that state’s order unconstitutional. The ruling is under appeal. Challenges in other states have been common, with judges often backing the governors. The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal from a Nevada church to hold in-person services.
Broadly, state orders directed people to stay home, but they offered many exceptions. West Virginia’s was typical. Residents could leave to ""engage in outdoor activity,"" buy groceries, attend religious services, and visit other family members, to name a few permitted reasons. 
While Barr painted these orders as similar to house arrest, the comparison is dicey. The terms of house arrest can range from an evening curfew to an absolute requirement to stay in the home. But regardless of how strict or loose they are, house arrest orders are closely enforced, often through the use of tracking devices.
The COVID-19 orders did not reach that level of enforcement, although states often had the option to charge violators with misdemeanors, and in some instances, people were charged.
The economic impact has been severe. Well over 11 million Americans lost their jobs due to the virus and remain unemployed. Tens of millions faced a temporary loss of income, and thousands of businesses suffered.
Infringements of civil liberties since 1900
The shutdown orders had an immediate effect on the lives of millions of Americans. We asked over a dozen historians if they could think of instances in post-slavery America that might be worse than shutting down restaurants, offices and many other enterprises for several months. 
Without any suggestion that this list is fully inclusive, here are a few examples they offered as ""the greatest intrusion on civil liberties"" other than slavery.
Anti-Black violence, Jim Crow and discrimination
Between 1900 and 1940, there were nearly 2,000 lynchings. Black people accounted for over 90% of the victims.
White mobs attacked entire communities. In 1919, government soldiers, armed with rifles and seven machine guns, and aided by white vigilantes, attacked the Black residents of Elaine, Ark. Over a span of five days, they killed many and burned farms and buildings throughout the region.
In 1921, a mob of white people turned the Black neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Okla., to rubble. Estimates of the death toll range from 75 to 300. In 1923, Rosewood, Fla., suffered the same fate. There are many other examples.
Turning to voting rights, states, mainly but not exclusively in the South, systematically denied the franchise to millions of citizens.
""Black voter participation, which in some places had been 90% of eligible male voters in the late 1860s and early 1870s, was cut to essentially zero by the early decades of the 20th century,"" Harvard Law School professor Michael J. Klarman told us when we looked at the history of this in 2011.
""Jim Crow regimes involved relentless efforts to stop all African Americans from voting and included brutal intimidation tactics, like lynching,"" said Heather Gerken, a Yale Law School professor.

By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







Home mortgages were beyond the reach of Black families due to Federal Housing Administration rules. Between 1930 and 1950, 98% of private mortgages were insured by the FHA. Only 2% of borrowers were non-white. The presence of Black people in a neighborhood was deemed a risk factor that discouraged lending. The policy denied Blacks people the same chance to accumulate wealth that white people enjoyed.
The Espionage and Sedition Acts during World War I
During World War I, Congress passed the Espionage and Sedition Acts to bolster the country in its battle against Germany. The Sedition Act outlawed any criticism of the war.
Columbia University historian Eric Foner called the period ""the most intense repression of civil liberties the nation has ever known.""
""Two thousand people were prosecuted for speech or press violations,"" said Oakland University professor emeritus Robert Justin Goldstein. ""One thousand were jailed. Eugene Debs (a trade union activist and Socialist Party candidate) was jailed for opposing the draft.""
Goldstein, author of ""Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1975,"" tells the story of a filmmaker who received a 10-year sentence for a movie about the American Revolution.
""It was called ‘The Spirit of 1776,’"" and it included a scene with British soldiers committing atrocities against Americans,"" Goldstein said. ""That got him in trouble. At the time, we were fighting (along) with the British, and the movie was seen as undercutting that.""
Expulsion of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the 1930s
As the Great Depression hit the U.S., people of Mexican descent were blamed for draining public resources. Secretary of Labor William Doak said deportation was essential for reducing unemployment. 
Immigration agents conducted raids across the country, but the largest number of removals took place in Southern California. By one estimate, local, state and federal officials deported nearly 2 million people, many of them minors born in the United States.
""More than half of those — about 1.2 million — were U.S. citizens, returned to a country where they had never been before and where they had few if any, rights, because they were not Mexican citizens,"" said Yale historian Laura Barraclough.
The program also undercut the freedom of American firms to conduct business. Farms struggled to find field workers, and in 1931, at a time when banks were in crisis, California reported a loss of $7 million in bank deposits as departing customers took their money with them to Mexico.
Internment of Japanese Americans during World War II
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order in February 1942 to remove anyone on the West Coast judged to be a threat to national security. The move was aimed at Japanese Americans. In congressional hearings, Justice Department officials objected on constitutional grounds, and the work of forced relocation was put in the hands of the U.S. Army.
Within six months in 1942, 122,000 people were sent to inland internment centers. About 70,000 of them were U.S. citizens. 
""Japanese Americans who evacuated often left without anything but a suitcase or two, and most never recovered their losses of homes, businesses, and possessions,"" said Northwestern University’s Shana Bernstein. ""The violation of civil liberties was so egregious that President Ronald Reagan officially apologized for it.""
A 1983 commission put their property losses at $1.3 billion.
Other intrusions
No list could be fully inclusive. For scale and brutality, the forced relocation and killings of Native Americans in the 19th century loomed large for several historians. 
In the 20th century, both the federal government and the states curtailed liberties in Americans’ private lives. Under the Comstock Act of 1873, it was a federal crime to distribute birth control materials through the mail or across state lines, even for married couples. 
Many states also banned interracial marriage. That stood until 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court took the case of Loving v the State of Virginia. Two Virginia residents were convicted and sentenced to a year in jail for violating the state’s miscegenation law. The judge offered to suspend the sentence if they left the state and didn’t return for 25 years.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that miscegenation laws violated the 14th Amendment and were ""odious to a free people.""
Other historians also listed the government study in collaboration with Tuskegee University that denied treatment for syphilis to over 600 Black men between 1932 and 1972. The government’s goal was to track the long-term effects of untreated disease. By the late 1940s, penicillin was the standard treatment but was never provided.
Our ruling
Barr said that COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were like house arrest and represented ""the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history"" since slavery.
While efforts to contain the coronavirus have brought hardship to millions of people, public health restrictions, while challenged, have largely passed legal muster.
On the flipside, denying the right to vote to millions of Black people, terrorizing Black communities, jailing people for voicing an opinion, and forcibly relocating or deporting over a million citizens go against core principles of the Constitution.
Suffering is not easily quantified, and we recognize that actions taken in the past that were not ruled at the time as having violated civil rights are viewed differently through history’s lens. But the scale and force of assaults on civil liberties in the past outweigh the infringements due to COVID-19.

Tucker Carlson","Tucker Carlson distorts new CDC report, makes false mask claim




If Your Time is short





The CDC report showed a correlation between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to bars and restaurants, where masks can’t be effectively worn. That counters Carlson’s claim that the July cases were “wearing a mask” and “infected anyway.”


The CDC report did not assess the impact of mask wearing on getting the coronavirus, and the study’s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S. The study dealt with 154 people who tested positive in July, not all the positive cases in July.


Masks are most effective as ""source control,"" preventing infected people from transmitting the virus. Experts say they offer the wearer some — but not total — protection.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News host Tucker Carlson misrepresented the findings of a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, amplifying misinformation from social media as he claimed on his TV show that the study showed masks don’t work like experts say.
Running through a series of data points listed in the CDC’s report, Carlson said during his Oct. 13 show: ""Almost everyone — 85% — who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly this doesn't work the way they tell us it works.""

The Fox News host’s take ran counter to comments he made in April touting the effectiveness of masks. It also contradicted the guidance of public health officials, who say mask wearing on a broad scale can slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Carlson’s misleading claim about the CDC study appeared to make its way to President Donald Trump, a frequent Fox News watcher and guest.
""Did you see, the CDC, that 85% of the people wearing the masks catch it, OK?"" Trump said during an Oct. 15 rally in Greenville, N.C.
The data in the CDC report, however, cannot be generalized to say ""almost everyone"" who wore a mask in July got the coronavirus. It’s from a very small sample the authors said may not be representative of the United States, and mask use was self-reported. The report does not say masks don’t work to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The CDC study wasn’t measuring mask effectiveness
The CDC paper summarizes findings from a survey of 314 people. The total included a group of 154 symptomatic people who tested positive for the coronavirus in July and a control group of 160 symptomatic people who tested negative for the coronavirus in July.
Based on the results of the survey, the CDC report said two activities were linked to a positive coronavirus test: close contact with someone who also tested positive, and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as bars and restaurants.
RELATED: No, masks don't collect the coronavirus
Of the 160 survey participants who tested negative, 74.2% said they ""always"" wore a mask or face covering and 14.5% said they ""often"" did so.
Of the 154 survey participants who tested positive, 70.6% said they ""always"" wore a mask or face covering and 14.4% said they ""often"" did so. Those numbers form the basis of Carlson’s claim that 85% of people ""who got the coronavirus in July (were) wearing a mask.""
A Fox News spokesperson pointed to those figures and a segment from Carlson’s show the following night. In the segment, Carlson addressed a statement he said the CDC made to Fox News. Carlson said the agency called his commentary on the September study ""misleading.""
""CDC guidance on masks has clearly stated that wearing a mask is intended to protect other people in case the mask wearer is infected,"" the CDC said in the statement. ""At no time has CDC guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers.""
Carlson told viewers the CDC didn’t address his original claim. ""The spokesman didn’t dispute that we had showed accurate data from the CDC, including that 85% of people who tested positive for coronavirus in July reported wearing a mask always or often,"" Carlson said.
But the CDC study wasn’t measuring the impact of masks. ""Participants were asked about mask use as an individual behavior,"" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald told PolitiFact. ""However, the aim of the study was to assess possible situations for community exposure, not mask use.""
Carlson misrepresented the CDC paper’s findings
It’s misleading to leap to conclusions about the effectiveness of masks from the CDC report, since most participants reported wearing them and the study was not controlling for mask use. 
""You can’t just look at a table and draw conclusions without understanding the details of the study,"" said Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist with the University of Florida.
""It is difficult to detect the effect of an exposure or intervention when it is widely deployed or used,"" McDonald added. He said both groups of participants had high levels of mask use, and that the rates of people who always wore a mask in each group were not ""statistically different.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The study did find a significant difference between the groups: whether participants went out for food or drink. The study authors wrote that those with positive test results were ""approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant"" than those who tested negative.
The link between restaurants and catching the coronavirus is important to Carlson’s claim, since most people lower their masks to sip their drink or eat their food. ""Restaurants and coffee shops are places where people will tend to not wear a mask,"" Prins said.
The study’s authors noted that masks ""cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking."" But Carlson claimed that 85% of July cases were ""wearing a mask"" and ""infected anyway.""
""Going to places where mask use and social distancing cannot be maintained might be an important risk factor for COVID-19,"" McDonald said.
Carlson’s comment also ignored limitations listed in the study. The people were surveyed at 11 health care facilities, where they’d all sought testing because they were experiencing symptoms. So they ""might not be representative of the United States population,"" the study’s authors wrote.
Ben Neuman, a virologist with Texas A&M University, Texarkana, also took issue with the survey’s reliance on the participants’ self-reporting of their own mask use. 
""There are certain things that are embarrassing or politically and socially sensitive, and you generally won’t get honest answers if you just ask them on a questionnaire,"" Neuman said.
Carlson misrepresented how masks work
Carlson’s claim also mischaracterized the science behind masks. While masks do provide some protection for wearers, experts and public health officials say they are most effective as ""source control,"" preventing infected people from transmitting the virus. 
""When a person who is infected with COVID-19 wears a mask, it helps to reduce the amount of virus that they release when they cough, talk, or even breathe,"" Prins said.
The CDC recommends wearing masks in public and when social distancing isn’t possible.
Neuman previously shared three studies with PolitiFact that found wearing masks reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. Other studies have said the same.
""Growing evidence increasingly shows that wearing masks in community settings reduces transmission among individuals in that community,"" McDonald said. ""There are laboratory studies, animal studies, community and epidemiological studies, as well as policy studies that show masking reduces transmission in communities by blocking exhaled respiratory droplets.""
The Fox News spokesperson cited CDC Director Robert Redfield’s September testimony as an example of how mask wearing ""doesn’t work the way they tell us it works,"" as Carlson claimed. Redfield touted the effectiveness of masks relative to a potential coronavirus vaccine.
""I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine,"" Redfield said in a clip Carlson played on his show.
But Redfield never said that masks only protect the wearer — or that they offer complete and total protection in that regard. He was comparing masks to a potential early vaccine, which he said wouldn’t necessarily guarantee an immune response.
""He was suggesting if everyone around him wore a mask, he would be protected until a vaccine became available,"" McDonald said. 
The CDC has been clear elsewhere that masks help keep infected people from passing the virus to others. The CDC’s website, for example, says masks help ""prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others."" It adds: ""The protective effects — how well the mask protects healthy people from breathing in the virus — are unknown.""
Our ruling
Carlson said that according to a recent CDC report, ""Almost everyone — 85% — who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly this doesn't work the way they tell us it works.""
Carlson didn’t pull the 85% figure out of thin air, but the conclusion he drew is wrong in multiple ways. For starters, the CDC report wasn’t designed to measure mask effectiveness, and the study’s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S.
The findings don’t prove masks are ineffective, either. Masks are most effective at preventing infected people from spreading the virus, and studies show they can help slow the spread. 
The correlation the CDC found between positive coronavirus tests and going to restaurants and bars suggests that taking masks off to eat or drink might increase risk.

Greg Murphy","No proof '1 million' North Carolinians exposed to coronavirus




If Your Time is short




U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, a doctor and a Republican from North Carolina, said a study “showed that over 1 million people in North Carolina have now been exposed to the virus.”
Murphy based his claim on the results of an ongoing study of antibody tests. More than 10% of tests are coming back positive.
But the study's lead researcher, as well as state health officials, say there's not enough data yet to estimate how many people have been exposed. Participation levels vary across the state.




See the sources for this fact-check




A North Carolina congressman says 10% of his state’s population has been exposed to the novel coronavirus.
U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, a doctor and a Republican, made the claim in a June 23 Facebook post criticizing Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.
""We also found out over the weekend that antibody testing conducted by Dr. John Sanders at Wake Forest University showed that over 1 million people in North Carolina have now been exposed to the virus. How could another institution in our state get this done so quickly when the governor’s administration could not?"" Murphy wrote.
Is Murphy right that 1 million North Carolinians have been exposed to the novel coronavirus? This particular claim stands out for several reasons:


1 million people equates to roughly 10% of North Carolina’s population, which is a little more than 10 million. 


North Carolina’s total number of lab-reported cases hasn't hit 100,000. 


At the time of Murphy’s tweet, the World Health Organization reported that there were fewer than 9 million cases reported worldwide.


There were fewer than 3 million cases in the United States as of July 6, according to the CDC.


Some people contract the virus and never know it because they don’t experience symptoms. So they would not be counted in tallies of confirmed positive cases that are often reported. The New York Times reported in June that the number of infections in certain parts of the country could be 10 times higher than the number of reported cases, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
In his Facebook post, Murphy makes an estimate based on preliminary data in an antibody study at Wake Forest University. But the post goes too far. Murphy frames the data as conclusive, something Wake Forest researchers and state officials aren’t willing to do.
Antibody tests
The first thing to know is an antibody test isn’t the same thing as a standard coronavirus test, often referred to as a ""diagnostic"" test.
Diagnostic tests tell you whether you are presently sick with the virus. These types of tests are being administered and tracked by governments around the world.
Antibody tests, as the CDC points out, detect proteins in your body that help fight off infections and can provide protection against a disease that you’ve been exposed to. So an antibody test may detect if you had a past infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. 
However, the CDC says the tests aren’t always definitive. Positive results can be triggered by other coronavirus strains, not just COVID-19. They also don’t show you whether you are currently infected with the virus. And scientists aren’t sure yet whether the presence of antibodies means someone is immune from the virus.
The Wake Forest study
So what did the Wake Forest University study say? The study, which state lawmakers sponsored in April, initially mailed tests to 1,000 North Carolinians. 
By mid-June, nearly 10% of the 5,000 people tested showed signs of antibodies, according to a story by WRAL.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







By June 30, the number of positive antibody tests had climbed to 12% from the study’s sample size of 18,000. Wake researchers hope to enroll more than 500,000 participants. And they post their updates online. 
Does that mean that 10% of North Carolinians have been exposed to the virus? No. 
The CDC has made estimates about coronavirus exposure in six select cases. But North Carolina is not one of them.
Dr. John Sanders, section head of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health and the lead researcher for the study, told PolitiFact that the study doesn’t have enough data yet to make an estimate about infections in North Carolina.
""Wake Forest Baptist Health has not extrapolated its data to cover the entire state,"" Sanders said through a spokesperson.
What experts said
Wake tracks the residence of participants. As of June 30, researchers had an abundance of evidence from the Winston-Salem area and far less from Wake and Mecklenburg counties — the two most populous areas of the state.

""The study's data is robust for our region but may not fully represent the state at this time,"" Sanders said. 
""Our partners at Atrium Health are currently collecting data and expanding the sampling reach,"" he added. ""As we add WakeMed Health, Vidant Health and New Hanover to the study, more broad research and data will be available.""
We asked North Carolina’s health department if they believe the study results represent coronavirus exposure in the state.
""No, the proportion with positive antibodies depends on who is tested and we don’t have data yet to tell us what that proportion is statewide,"" said Kelly Haight Connor, the department’s communications manager.
NC’s health department is also involved in other antibody prevalence studies, Connor said. So far, those studies found fewer positive returns.
""The first of those studies found SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in samples from 6.4% of random samples from 1,780 patients collected from mid-April to mid-May at UNC hospitals (Chapel Hill, Rex, Chatham and Johnston),"" she said. 
""This study is on-going; researchers are doing additional analyses and will continue testing to monitor for changes over time.""
Researchers believe more people have been exposed than the case reports show. But they’re not predicting a figure as high as 10%.
Paul Delamater, assistant professor in the Department of Geography at UNC-Chapel Hill, and Julie Swann, head of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at North Carolina State University, told WRAL on July 6 that they believe roughly 500,000 people could have been exposed to the virus.

Murphy said a study ""showed that over 1 million people in North Carolina have now been exposed to the virus.""

Sherri Tenpenny","Sherri Tenpenny makes false COVID-19 vaccine magnetism claim to Ohio lawmakers




If Your Time is short





The available COVID-19 vaccines do not contain microchips or metallic ingredients that could cause a magnet to stick to a recipient’s body.


The CDC says on its website that the vaccines “will not make you magnetic, including at the site of vaccination which is usually your arm. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection.”


Dr. Sherri Tenpenny is an anti-vaccine activist who has spread false claims about the COVID-19 vaccines before.





See the sources for this fact-check




An anti-vaccine activist falsely claimed during a hearing with Ohio state legislators that the COVID-19 vaccines are magnetizing people who get them.
Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an Ohio-based osteopathic physician who wrote a book called ""Saying No to Vaccines,"" has been identified by the news site rating service Newsguard as a ""super-spreader"" of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. A watchdog group at McGill University in Montreal found that she is one of 12 influencers responsible for 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation spread on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. 
Tenpenny has previously pushed false claims that the COVID-19 vaccines can cause death and autoimmune disease, disrupt pregnancies and ""shed"" to affect unvaccinated people. 
Her latest comments came as she testified at the invitation of Ohio’s Republican lawmakers in favor of a bill that would prevent businesses or the government from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination, according to the Columbus Dispatch.
""I’m sure you’ve seen the pictures all over the internet of people who’ve had these shots, and now they’re magnetized,"" Tenpenny said during the June 8 hearing. ""They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick. Because now we think that there’s a metal piece to that.""
Those claims are baseless. There are no metallic ingredients in any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. for emergency use, from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The Food and Drug Administration has published the ingredients for each online.
""There’s nothing there that a magnet can interact with,"" Thomas Hope, a vaccine researcher at Northwestern University, previously told AFP Fact Check. ""It’s protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH. That’s basically it, so this is not possible.""
PolitiFact and several other fact-checkers previously debunked the videos and ""pictures all over the internet"" that Tenpenny cited as proof, which purported to show magnets sticking to vaccinated people. The social media posts about vaccine magnetism were so widespread that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed them on its website:

All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys, as well as any manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors. In addition, the typical dose for a COVID-19 vaccine is less than a milliliter, which is not enough to allow magnets to be attracted to your vaccination site even if the vaccine was filled with a magnetic metal.""
Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at New York's Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, previously told PolitiFact the claims about vaccine magnetism were ""utter nonsense."" 
Other experts told AFP Fact Check that the metal objects highlighted in various online videos and images are likely sticking for other reasons. They could have tape or another adhesive on them, for example. Or they could appear to stick because of the oil on a person’s skin.
Later on in the Ohio House hearing, a nurse tried unsuccessfully to prove Tenpenny’s theory by positioning a key and a bobby pin against her neck. ""Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too,"" she said, even as the key she pressed to her neck did not stick.
 
Tenpenny also claimed that there is ""some sort of an interface, ‘yet to be defined’ interface, between what’s being injected in these shots and all of the 5G towers,"" and that the vaccines have caused thousands of deaths in the U.S. Both of those claims are inaccurate.

Duey Stroebel","Wisconsin Sen. Stroebel misfires with claim CDC admits old ‘science’ was wrong on COVID quarantine




If Your Time is short





The CDC now says that people who were exposed to the virus and are unable to quarantine a full 14 days can instead quarantine seven or 10 days and still largely reduce risk of transmission. 


But they didn’t say their 14-day quarantine recommendation was wrong. In fact, it’s still recommended that you quarantine 14 days if you can.





See the sources for this fact-check




The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a change in guidance on coronavirus quarantines earlier this week, which could ease the strain on people who are exposed to the virus but need to get back to work or other responsibilities. 
In the updated guidance, released Dec. 2, the CDC said an exposed person who lives in a community with adequate testing can quarantine seven days instead of 14 provided they test negative for the virus at some point in the last two days of their quarantine.
Quarantine could end after 10 days without a test if the person watches for symptoms of the virus and has none, the guidance adds. The person is expected to continue symptom-monitoring and wearing a mask for the full two-week stretch. 
It sounds like good news, but state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Cedarburg, didn’t seem to take it that way. 
""CDC admits old ‘science’ was wrong, says new ‘science’ is only a 7-day quarantine after close contact followed by no symptoms and negative test, 10-day quarantine w/o testing and no symptoms,"" Stroebel tweeted Dec. 3, along with a link to the new information. 
But it’s actually the senator who is wrong. Here’s why.
What spurred the change in guidance?
The move came as the CDC acknowledged that a 14-day quarantine is tough on some Americans, particularly those who need to get back to work in-person. Experts say a shorter quarantine may make people more likely to comply with staying home and more willing to work with public health employees to identify their close contacts so transmission can be cut off. 
It also hones in on the period in which a person would be most capable of passing the virus on if they’d become infected. John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC’s coronavirus response, said people who quit quarantine after seven days carry just about a 5% risk of still passing the virus on, and those who stop after 10 days bear just 1% risk.   
So the agency isn’t saying their previous guidance was wrong. In fact, their recommendation to quarantine for 14 days if it’s possible is still in effect. The new guidance simply provides two alternatives for people who are unable to wait. 
""Any option to shorten quarantine risks being less effective than the currently recommended 14-day quarantine,"" the guidance states. 
Why is guidance changing?
Like others who have sought to downplay the seriousness of the virus, Stroebel is undermining scientific evidence by criticizing a change in what experts are saying. 
While it certainly would have saved lives if we knew everything about COVID-19 as soon as it emerged, that’s just not how science works.

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







The world had never seen SARS-CoV-2 before early last year, so there’s a lot to learn about it. That means guidelines will change to keep us safest in accordance with what we’re learning. 
Some examples: 


Scientists determined early-on that masks help keep you from giving the virus to others. In November, the CDC released a bulletin saying for the first time that they may protect the wearer, too. This change is expected — it signals research progress being made. 


In July, the World Health Organization announced that the virus may linger in the air in indoor spaces, a form of transmission it had previously called doubtful. Again, new scientific evidence helped bring this revelation to light.


Inside hospitals, health care workers discovered that proning, a technique where patients lay on their stomachs to promote better lung expansion, can sometimes alleviate the need to put a patient on a ventilator, which was initially thought to be one of the most critical tools for a seriously ill coronavirus patient. Once again, this was a product of learning more about the virus. 


This is how scientific research works all over the world. The Ebola virus, for example, was discovered in 1976, and scientists and public health officials were still studying and making changes to their approach when an outbreak arose in West Africa nearly 40 years later. It is extremely likely, if not inevitable, that we’ll still be learning about the novel coronavirus four decades from now, too.
In response to an email asking for backup to the senator’s claim, policy director Brian Sikma said Stroebel believes public health recommendations should continue to be revised as more research and data add to our understanding of the virus. 
""Because science never stops questioning itself, public health officials and policymakers should be transparent in their recommendations and avoid broad, absolute statements when actual knowledge is still evolving,"" Sikma wrote.
That reflects an acknowledgement of the scientific process that Stroebel’s claim did not. But it also provides no evidence of his claim.
Our rating
Stroebel claimed the CDC admitted it was wrong about its previous recommendation that people who were exposed to the virus should quarantine for 14 days. 
But they adjusted the guidance because scientists learned more about its contagious period, and because they wanted to make it easier for people to stay home. A 14-day quarantine is still their recommended route, if people can make it work.
The CDC guidance remains in place, so it wasn’t ""wrong,"" and there was no admission.

Mike Pence","Pence uses outdated numbers to tout Wisconsin job gains and unemployment numbers




If Your Time is short





In a statement, Pence’s office boasted of a series of job-related gains in Wisconsin, saying they covered the time to the present.


But the numbers -- from March -- are outdated and ignore the picture since the coronavirus pandemic took hold.


The true picture is far worse.





See the sources for this fact-check




In the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have been frequent visitors to Wisconsin.
So, you’d think by now they’d have their talking points about the state right.
In an Oct. 11, 2020, news release announcing Pence’s visit two days later to Waukesha, his office claimed the administration’s economic policies ""led to an unemployment rate of 3.1% in Wisconsin and 61,000 jobs, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs since President Trump took office.""
But those numbers are all from before the coronavirus pandemic cratered the nation’s economy. 
So, what’s the full picture?
Unemployment numbers
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate for August 2020 was 6.2%. Those numbers are preliminary, but the most recent available. In any case, that’s double the rate cited by Pence.
We reached out to Pence’s office seeking backup for the claim, but they did not offer an explanation for the discrepancy. 
But our examination of the numbers found the news release appears to be citing the March 2020 unemployment rate. The rate was that low – 3.1% – at the time, but climbed dramatically in the wake of COVID-fueled shutdowns across the country.
Here is the fuller picture: When Trump took office in January 2017, the Wisconsin unemployment rate was at 3.6%, and had been on a downward trend through 2016.
In 2017, the unemployment rate continued to decrease and then held steady for some months at 3%. It was at 3.1% in January 2019, and gradually increased until a sharp decline between February 2020 (3.5%) and March 2020 (3.1%).
But it has spiked since then.
In short, Pence used outdated numbers to paint a rosier-than-reality picture.
Overall job numbers
The second number the release cites is the number of jobs added in Wisconsin.
The difference between the January 2017 numbers, when Trump took office, and the preliminary numbers for August 2020 shows a net loss of 181,900 jobs in Wisconsin.

“Before the pandemic, just over 40,000 were on continuing UI claims. Now, there are well over 100,000 on state or federal UI benefits.”












By D.L. Davis • June 18, 2021







If you use February 2017, the month after President Trump’s inauguration, as a starting point, there is an even bigger net loss of 185,000 Wisconsin jobs. 
To be sure, there are many cautions about this approach. The preliminary numbers can sometimes change considerably before they are made final. And the BLS prefers to compare year-over-year numbers – i.e. January to January – due to seasonal employment changes.
But the comparison underlines a stark difference due to the economic fallout of coronavirus – something ignored by Pence’s numbers.
In any case, it’s unclear where Pence’s office got the increase of 61,000 jobs. Despite our request, they did not offer an explanation.
We looked at the numbers in a variety of ways, including whether they represented a high-water mark for some point during his presidency, but could not crack the code.
One way to get 61,000 jobs is to take the difference between October 2016 – when President Trump had not been elected, let alone took office – (2,932,700 nonfarm jobs) and February 2020 (2,993,700 nonfarm jobs), the highest tally under Trump. 
Manufacturing jobs number
The same ignore-the-pandemic problem holds here.
Between January 2017 and August 2020 there was a net loss of 9,200 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin. 
It seems Pence’s office got the 15,000 gain by taking the difference between January 2017 and March 2020.
Taking credit
In the news release, Pence’s office said the administration ""enacted pro-growth policies, which led"" to the numbers cited.
That leads us to the issue of credit and blame – something we always consider when politicians make such boasts. For instance, when former Gov. Scott Walker touted similar numbers when in office, economists noted he could not take full credit because the state is affected by many national and global economic forces and trends. The same scenario applies here, in reverse. 
Finally, it’s worth noting that Trump has argued he should be judged mainly on how the economy was performing before the pandemic.  But he has taken credit for recent bounceback growth and noted – especially when defending his late-in-term Supreme Court nomination – that he is elected to a full four-year term, not a partial term.
What’s more, the news release itself used the phrase ""since President Trump took office,"" not ""in the first 38 months of President Trump’s term.""
Our ruling
Pence claimed in a news release that since he and Trump took office, their policies ""led to an unemployment rate of 3.1% in Wisconsin and 61,000 jobs, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs.""
Those numbers may have been high-water marks before the pandemic, but they ignore the current reality. Even then, they overstate the credit for improvements that are driven by many economic forces.

The World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted by mosquitoes.

 
COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that spreads primarily from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or nasal discharge.

Misleading claims on social media have spread the myth that with summer around the corner, mosquitoes are another way that COVID-19 will spread.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
While mosquitoes can transmit some illnesses such as malaria, we found no evidence that COVID-19 is spread through mosquitoes. It is a respiratory virus that spreads between people, public health agencies say.
""To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes,"" says the World Health Organization on a myth-busting page.
The main driver of COVID-19 transmission, based on available data, is people who have symptoms, WHO spokeswoman Carla Drysdale told PolitiFact.
COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, the WHO found.

For a virus to pass to a person through a mosquito or tick bite, the virus must be able to replicate inside the mosquito or tick, said Joseph M Conlon, an adviser for the American Mosquito Control Association.
""None of the coronaviruses have been shown to do that,"" he said.
However, mosquitoes can factor into the severity of the disease if a patient has underlying medical issues due to mosquito-borne diseases, Conlon said. 
""Mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile virus and dengue fever have not disappeared as COVID-19 has usurped the media landscape,"" he said. ""As potential contributors to severe outcomes, their prevention/control becomes even more critical.""
Though the WHO and CDC have said mosquitoes don’t transmit COVID-19, ProPublica reported that an internal briefing memo showed that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own study into the matter.

The April 22 post includes a screenshot of part of a news article published two days earlier by WHBQ, a Memphis TV station. 
The article reported on a bill introduced April 17 by U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that affects your primary residence — whether you rent or own.
Had it become law, H.R. 6515, also called the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act, would have meant that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development would have cut you a check for any rent or mortgage payment you had made for April (or later months, if you’re someone who pays ahead).
Also, you would not owe any rent or mortgage payments until 30 days after the end date of the COVID-19 emergency declaration signed by President Donald Trump. 
As it is, though, no action has yet been taken on the bill, other than it being referred to the House Committee on Financial Service. A service used by GovTrack.us, which tracks legislation, says the bill has a 4% chance of being passed.

If Your Time is short





New York and Nevada have restricted access to chloroquine prescriptions to avoid stockpiling of the drug. There are exemptions for clinical trials and patients hospitalized with COVID-19.


Michigan has not taken any regulatory action related to chloroquine. Instead, it has asked prescribers to not give the drug to potential stockpilers.





See the sources for this fact-check




Facebook pages and groups are promoting misleading information about several states’ decisions to restrict access to a malaria drug that could be used to treat COVID-19.
One post, published March 29 in a group called ""Keep America great Trump Pence 2020,"" claims that three Democratic governors have ""issued orders banning the prescription of hydroxychloroquine to patients with COVID-19."" The post includes photos of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak.
""For a drug deemed safe by doctors and has a history of safely treating malaria for the last 40-50 years,"" reads a caption on the post. ""So now ask yourself...who is the enemy.""
The photo collage also asserts that the governors are ""threatening the licenses of doctors and pharmacist(s)."" That’s similar to a claim made in a Facebook post published by Trending Politics, a conservative opinion website, on March 27.
""The Democrat Governor of Michigan along with other Democrat governors are THREATENING doctors who prescribe the promising drug Chloroquine to Coronavirus patients,"" reads text on an image of Whitmer.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Collectively, they’ve been shared thousands of times.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Since President Donald Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19, several states have restricted access to the malaria drug to prevent stockpiling — including New York and Nevada. But neither of those orders bans the use of chloroquine outright, and Michigan has not taken formal action to restrict access to the drug.
New York, Nevada restrict access to chloroquine
New York and Nevada have limited access to chloroquine since Trump’s March 19 press briefing. But neither of the actions comprise an outright ban on the drug.
Take Nevada, for example. On March 24, Sisolak signed an emergency regulation that safeguards the supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which is sold under the brand name Plaquenil and as a generic. The order prohibits doctors in outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing the drugs for COVID-19 treatment. It also limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies.
""While the two drugs serve necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada’s own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said during a press conference. ""The emergency regulation is aimed at preventing the hoarding of the drugs so those that actually need them can have access to them.""
As several news outlets have reported, physicians around the country have started to prescribe themselves chloroquine in order to hoard it for their families. That hoarding has led to drug shortages in some parts of the country, affecting patients who take chloroquine regularly to treat conditions like lupus and arthritis.
Conservative organizations like Turning Point USA took Nevada’s order to mean Sisolak was banning any use of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients. But there is an exemption to the order. 
RELATED: Conservative group's meme distorts Nevada’s chloroquine restrictions
A spokesman for Sisolak told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas that the regulation allows for a ""chart order for an inpatient in an institutional setting,"" meaning that doctors in hospitals and emergency rooms can still prescribe chloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







That’s similar to what the government has done in New York.
On March 23, Cuomo signed an executive order restricting the prescription of chloroquine ""except when written as prescribed for an FDA-approved indication; or as part of a state approved clinical trial related to COVID-19 for a patient who has tested positive for COVID-19.""
The state has acquired more than 800,000 doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for clinical trials. And while the Food and Drug Administration has said there are no approved drugs to treat or prevent the coronavirus, the agency is investigating whether chloroquine ""can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms."" On March 28, the FDA signed an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
The day before that action, Cuomo amended his previous restrictions on the drug. 
The new rules allow health care providers to prescribe the drug for ""patients in inpatient settings and acute settings; for residents in a subacute part of a skilled nursing facility; or as part of an study approved by an Institutional Review Board."" The change means that, similar to Nevada, doctors in New York can now prescribe chloroquine to COVID-19 patients in hospitals and emergency rooms, but not in outpatient settings.
Bottom line: Neither Nevada nor New York currently bans the use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus patients.
Michigan warns of ‘administrative action’ for stockpiling
Michigan has taken no formal action to restrict access to chloroquine. Instead, it has asked prescribers to not stockpile the drug for friends and family.
On March 24, the state’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs sent a letter to ""licensed prescribers and dispensers"" about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. It said that the department had received ""multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to themselves, family, friends, and/or coworkers without a legitimate medical purpose.""
""Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other ailments for which chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are proven treatments,"" the letter reads. ""Reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action.""
The letter did not outline any new regulatory action related to chloroquine. In a follow-up statement published March 27, the department said the purpose of the correspondence was ""to remind both prescribers and dispensers of their continued obligation to adhere to the standards of practice.""
RELATED: A 100% COVID-19 cure? No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal
On March 31, however, the state shifted course. It requested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile based on the FDA emergency authorization for using the drug to treat severe cases of COVID-19. The Detroit News reported that several hospitals in the metro area are using chloroquine to treat hospitalized patients.
In an op-ed, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey explained why the government included the ""administrative action"" wording in its original letter.
""We needed something to prevent chloroquine from becoming the next toilet paper,"" he told the Detroit News. ""I quickly requested of (Whitmer’s) staff that they put something out, and somehow in the translation it was prohibiting use of these drugs — and that wasn't the intent.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims the governors of Michigan, Nevada and New York have ordered banning the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients.
Nevada and New York have restricted access to the malaria drug in an effort to limit stockpiling. Each state has exemptions for patients hospitalized with the coronavirus. Michigan has taken no additional regulatory action to restrict access to chloroquine; instead, it has asked prescribers to avoid giving the drug to potential stockpilers.

If Your Time is short





The CDC’s running tally of deaths for a given year can count multiple causes for each death. The single underlying cause is reflected in finalized year-end data issued the following year. 


The deaths in the 900 range refer to cases where pneumonia was the final underlying cause of death. But the number cited for 2020 includes deaths where pneumonia is one of the causes listed on the death certificate.


Government officials have said that the national data on COVID-19 deaths is likely an undercount.





See the sources for this fact-check




The COVID-19 death toll has become a political football.
Democratic politicians and groups suggested on social media that government officials have misidentified COVID-19 deaths as pneumonia cases in an effort to conceal the true coronavirus death count.
""According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from COVID-19 and 5,185 from pneumonia. Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?"" stated a May 27 Facebook post by the New Florida Majority, a liberal group. The post included a photo of Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The group got the information from a viral tweet by Kellen Squire, an ER nurse in Virginia.
 
The tweet drew tens of thousands of likes and shares over the next few days and was echoed by Democratic political figures. Former party chairman Howard Dean accused Florida of ""cooking the books.""
That doesn’t appear to be what happened. While some of the numbers in the post are in the ballpark, the way Squire compared them creates a misleading picture.

How the CDC codes pneumonia and COVID deaths
Squire, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, told us he drew his information from a Reddit thread showing death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The r/coronavirus thread said Florida’s pneumonia deaths were in the 900 range between 2015 and 2018, but jumped above 4,000 this year. Squire ran with those numbers for his tweet, pulling in CDC estimates for Florida deaths from COVID-19 and pneumonia this year. (The data for 2019 has not yet been finalized.)

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







But that comparison doesn’t work, said Bob Anderson, the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch in the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. The issue is the way causes of death are coded in CDC data.
If the death certificate mentions both COVID-19 and pneumonia, both codes are included in CDC data for the current year, and the death will be allocated to both categories in the CDC’s provisional surveillance system, which keeps a rough running tally of deaths in a given year. In 2021, when the CDC finalizes the data and reports national statistics for 2020 cases, it will focus on the underlying cause of death, and assign only one cause to each death. In a case where both pneumonia and COVID-19 are reported on the death certificate, the underlying cause will almost always be COVID-19, Anderson said.  
In recent years, the number of Florida residents whose underlying cause of death was pneumonia was in the 900s through this point in the year. (When Anderson looked at a separate category of deaths that occurred in Florida, which includes residents and visitors, the numbers were slightly higher.)
For the 5,185 figure that Squire tweeted, ""many of them actually are pneumonia due to COVID-19, or pneumonia due to other conditions such as influenza,"" Anderson said. ""But the fact is those with pneumonia due to COVID-19 would be counted in both COVID-19 and pneumonia category"" in the provisional data.
So what these posts did was take the 900 figure, which referred to cases in recent years where pneumonia is the underlying cause of death, and compare that to a broader category of cases this year where pneumonia is mentioned on a death certificate, data which is provisional at this point.
That said, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's leading infectious-disease specialist, and other medical experts have said the government’s COVID-19 death toll is an undercount. There are several reasons why a COVID-19 death might not be reported as such, including that a test was not available or that the person died at home. 
""It is likely we are underestimating the number of deaths at this point from COVID-19, but it’s going to vary from state to state,"" Anderson said.
A spokeswoman for the New Florida Majority, which posted the claim on Facebook, pointed to an article by The Daily Beast about undercounting of COVID deaths in Florida and elsewhere.
Florida’s public data reporting about COVID-19 deaths has drawn scrutiny. In May, a state Department of Health employee said she was pressured to manipulate data and was fired. A spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis said the employee had been insubordinate and the state denied any manipulation of the data. However, county medical examiners have reported higher death counts than the state.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said, ""According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from COVID-19 and 5,185 from pneumonia. Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?"" 
Each number here stems from actual data, but the post makes comparisons between them that are misleading. Pneumonia deaths in Florida are up this year compared with some recent years, but the tweet ignores that the CDC’s provisional data for this year counts some deaths for now as being caused by both pneumonia and COVID-19. Finalized 2020 data released next year will list only one underlying cause of death.

The Gateway Pundit","No, reports to the CDC’s vaccine early warning system are not ‘vaccine deaths’




If Your Time is short





The federal Centers for Disease Control Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration maintain a Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).


Anyone can report “adverse events” to a vaccine — as in possible side effects — to VAERS. The reports are not verified and do not indicate whether an adverse event is linked to or caused by a vaccine.


Regarding COVID-19, vaccines have been administered to millions of people across Europe and the United States. There hasn’t been any definitive proof that a COVID-19 vaccination led to someone’s death.





See the sources for this fact-check




Without mentioning COVID-19, a headline widely shared on Facebook raises an alarm about vaccines while referencing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading federal agency fighting the coronavirus.
The headline is on an article from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website. It states:
""Per the CDC, there are nearly twice as many vaccine related deaths SO FAR in 2021 (1,755) than all the vaccine deaths this past decade (994).""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
These are not counts of ""vaccine deaths"" — they are unverified reports of deaths that occur after a vaccination. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths. And there have not been more vaccine-related deaths in 2021 than in the previous decade.
Claim manipulates unvetted data
The headline cites figures from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, which is maintained by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The agencies warn that reports of adverse events — in other words, possible side effects — made to the VAERS database do not indicate whether an adverse event is linked to or caused by a vaccine; the reports, which can be made by anyone and are not verified, are intended as an early warning system to detect possible safety problems. 
As Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a physician in the infectious-disease division at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told PolitiFact: ""The VAERS system is very noisy, so it's hard to compare."" Offit said the system identifies ""a lot of temporal associations that are not necessarily causal.""
Moreover, the database does not compare death rates associated with vaccinations to see whether they are higher or lower than death rates among people who were not vaccinated, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center at Emory University.

Orenstein also said that given the national focus on COVID-19, people are more likely to report deaths following a COVID-19 vaccination; and given the focus on vaccinating the elderly for the coronavirus in care facilities, it’s likely there will be more reports of death because those older people tend to have other health problems.

There is a lot of confusion surrounding Trump’s use of supplemental oxygen to treat his COVID-19 symptoms. But is there any evidence that the president boarded Marine One with a ""portable oxygen concentrator?"" 
No — multiple fact-checkers have debunked the conspiracy theory, and video evidence refutes it. We reached out to the original poster for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
The confusion stems from the Trump administration’s shifting timeline for when the president first tested positive for the coronavirus and whether he was administered supplemental oxygen.

Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, originally declined to say whether he had given Trump oxygen. But on Oct. 3, Conley told reporters that Trump was ""fever-free and off supplemental oxygen."" Several news outlets have since reported that Trump was given oxygen on the morning of Oct. 2 — before he left for Walter Reed. 
""Yesterday morning we were real concerned with that,"" said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in an interview with Fox News on Oct. 3. ""He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly.""
But that doesn’t mean Trump had a portable oxygen concentrator when he boarded Marine One.
The source of the viral claim appears to be a now-suspended Twitter account that published the photos of Trump walking to Marine One on Oct. 2. The post was shared thousands of times before Twitter suspended the account for violating its rules.

stated on June 2, 2021 in an Instagram post








An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The claim is wrong. The only way a person can become vaccinated is to receive the vaccine.

(Screengrab from Instagram)
 
The post’s claim appears to be rooted in the debunked notion that the COVID-19 vaccines can be ""shed"" like the coronavirus itself. But there is no biological mechanism for any COVID-19 vaccine side effects or components to be transmitted to others.
 
COVID-19 vaccines produce a spike protein inside the cells of the person contained deep within the muscle and lymph nodes. The messenger RNA, or mRNA, used by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and the altered adenovirus used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine cannot shed because they do not replicate. 
 
Adam Wheatley, a senior research fellow in microbiology and immunology at the University of Melbourne, said that these vaccines do not cause shedding because they encode only the spike protein, which cannot form a virus and pass from one person to another. 
 
Akiko Iwasaki, an expert of immunobiology at Yale and a principal investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, said that the vaccine protein vector will face a ""dead end"" inside the vaccinated person and degrade naturally. 
 
The CDC has advised that there is no evidence that any authorized COVID-19 shot will result in fertility problems or miscarriages. Likewise, there is no truth to the claim that people who are not vaccinated can suffer miscarriage or fertility problems by being around those who are. 
 
The CDC reports that those who are trying to become pregnant also do not need to avoid pregnancy after COVID-19 vaccination.
 
Asked about the post’s claims, a Pfizer spokesperson said that the vaccine can enter the human body only through an administered dose. 
 
By citing ""page 67"" of the ""vaccine warnings,"" the post appears to be referencing page 67 of the Pfizer clinical vaccine protocol. There, a passage says that an environmental vaccine ""exposure during pregnancy"" is considered to have taken place when:
 
""A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.
 
""A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.""
 
Asked about this passage in the protocol, a Pfizer spokesperson said that, based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines cannot cause COVID-19 infection in the mother or infant. According to the CDC, any of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines can be administered to pregnant or lactating people. 
 
In short, the passage is described by experts as standard language meant to widely cover any possible exposures and ensure that the clinical trial process is rigorously regulated. Its inclusion in the safety protocol means that investigators are made aware when, say, a pregnant person has been environmentally exposed to the vaccine. This information enables them to study whether there is any effect. However, exposure to a person who has received the Pfizer vaccine will not transmit virus particles, since no COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use contains the live virus.
 
Our ruling
An Instagram post claims that ""you can be 'vaccinated' regardless of whether you receive the shot or not.""
That’s wrong. The only way to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is to receive a vaccine. It is biologically impossible for COVID-19 vaccines to result in virus shedding that will expose others to the virus, let alone in a way that would give unvaccinated people immunity.

Facebook posts","Fact-checking claims about nurses getting nothing but false-positive COVID-19 tests




If Your Time is short





We could find no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating COVID-19 test results to create false-positives. Similarly unproven claims have been circulating for weeks and echo months-old conspiracy theories.


Jeffrey Sebelia, the source of the Facebook post, said it was a “word-of-mouth story” from his mom. He had no further proof to support the claim.


While COVID-19 tests may sometimes produce false-positive results, they’re rare. Experts are more concerned about false-negatives.


Data currently shows more than 90% of coronavirus tests come back negative.





See the sources for this fact-check




What do Elon Musk and the winner of ""Project Runway"" Season 3 have in common? They’ve both shared unproven claims about false-positive coronavirus test results.
Since states started reopening in May, COVID-19 cases have increased in the United States. A June 27 post claims that’s because the labs that process coronavirus tests are falsifying results.
""It’s frightening how we’re being rail railroaded,"" reads the post, which is a screenshot of an Instagram post from Jeffrey Sebelia, the winner of the third season of ""Project Runway."" ""My mom actually knows a nurse in San Francisco who was giving COVID tests. After every test came back positive she got suspicious. So she sent in two separate blank tests. Unused swabs. Those both came back positive.""
Sebelia said his mom and some co-workers used fake names to submit 10 unused swabs that all tested positive.
""What the he’ll is going on ????"" reads the post, which we cannot access since Sebelia’s account is private. ""It’s beyond greed and money for hospitals. We are being controlled and manipulated beyond anything we could ever imagine.""
The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar posts have been shared thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
We reached out to Sebelia for evidence to back up his post. He told us it was a ""word-of-mouth story"" from his mom.
""She doesn’t lie but beyond that there is no proof,"" he said in an email.
Sebelia is right — there is no proof to back up his claims. But over the past several weeks, many social media users — including Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX — have passed on secondhand stories about fraudulent COVID-19 tests or unproven claims about false-positives. So we wanted to look into the notion that labs are falsifying COVID-19 test results.
Public health officials say that false-positive tests are rare; the real concern is false-negatives. 
Labs aren’t manipulating results
While COVID-19 tests may sometimes produce false-positive results, there is no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating samples. And public health officials are more concerned about false-negatives than false-positives.
There are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease.
Since diagnostic tests are considered the most common and reliable COVID-19 test, we’re going to focus on them.
There are more than 100 diagnostic tests that have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Many cities and health care providers use private firms like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics to provide and process diagnostic coronavirus tests. We reached out to both companies for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
We could find no evidence that labs are deliberately altering coronavirus test results to create false-positives.
RELATED: The international supply chain behind coronavirus testing
The accuracy of a coronavirus diagnostic test depends on several factors, including the timing of the test and how it was stored. There have been several cases of tests producing the wrong results.
In mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning saying that a rapid-response test from Abbott Laboratories could produce false-negative results.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Abbott advised health care providers not to store patient samples in solutions known as ""viral transport media."" The company said the swabs should be placed directly into the device and then the test will work as expected.
The accuracy of COVID-19 tests, particularly for people who are not experiencing symptoms, is still uncertain. But false-positive results appear to be an outlier.
A LabCorp fact sheet for the company’s diagnostic coronavirus test says there is a ""very small chance"" the test can give false-positive results. The instructions for a similar test from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that false test results are ""highly dependent on prevalence.""
""False-negative test results are more likely when prevalence of disease is high,"" the document reads. ""False-positive test results are more likely when prevalence is moderate to low.""
In layman's terms: as coronavirus infections increase, so does the chance of false-negative results. So it stands to reason that, as the U.S. continues to see new COVID-19 cases rise, false-negative results are more common than false-positives.
That fact can have worse unintended consequences than false-positive results. People who receive false-negative results may not seek treatment for COVID-19 symptoms and risk infecting more people.
Posts echo existing conspiracy theories
Sebelia’s post inspired a slew of copy-pasted hoaxes about COVID-19 testing. Many cite friends or family members, and they echo months-old conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic.
A June 30 Facebook post is very similar to Sebelia’s story.
""Nurses at a hospital doing covid testing became suspicious when all their tests were coming back positive,"" reads the post. ""They sent 2 tests with unused swabs and they came back positive. Nurses used fake names, sent 10 unused swabs to be tested and all came back positive. We are being played!""
The post is a screenshot of a now-deleted tweet from a user named Robert Tayman, whose account was created in February and regularly promotes conspiratorial content. He said in a follow-up tweet (also deleted) that the nurses are ""close personal friends that work at a major hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.""

(Screenshot from Twitter)
The Baltimore Department of Health denied commenting for this story.
Tayman’s tweet was deleted, but screenshots quickly made their way to Facebook, where they were shared thousands of times.
The first few posts with Tayman’s tweet were published in conservative and anti-media groups on June 29, according to CrowdTangle. At first, users started off linking to the tweet, but soon users were posting screenshots of the post. Eventually, the text of the tweet was copied and shared with no context at all — similar to how chain emails work. 
Another Facebook post, published June 29, also recounts the story about nurses sending in ""10 unused swabs"" that all came back positive. The post is a screenshot of an Instagram post and cites a sister who’s a cardiac ICU nurse.
""The consensus was not that +cases don’t exist, but that the numbers are exaggerated,"" reads text in the screenshot.
In each iteration of the post, the one clear theme is that every test comes back positive. But that belies the actual numbers hospitals and health departments are reporting. According to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, the rate of positive coronavirus tests has never exceeded 21.9% (that was in early April). The positivity testing rate hit a low of 4.4% in mid-June. Currently, it’s around 7%. That means 93% of tests produce negative results. 
These recent posts were not created in a vacuum. Similar rumors have circulated recently in India and Turkey. And conspiracy theories that claim officials are falsifying coronavirus test results — or that the pandemic itself is fabricated — have been circulating online for months.
In late March, a website called the Cabal Times wrote about a video from a Swedish YouTuber who goes by the name Zakleo Se Bumbar. The video spins an elaborate conspiracy theory that asserts false-positive COVID-19 tests are driving the bulk of new cases.
Our ruling
The Facebook post claims that labs are manipulating coronavirus tests to create false-positive results.
We could find no evidence to back that up. Sebelia, the source of the claim, said it was a ""word-of-mouth story"" from his mom without proof. Similarly inaccurate or unproven claims about coronavirus tests have been circulating for weeks, many of which echo months-old conspiracy theories about the pandemic.
While COVID-19 tests may sometimes produce false-positive results, there is no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating samples. Experts are more concerned about false-negatives, which could pose health consequences.

Scientists worldwide have publicly shared the genetic makeup of the coronavirus thousands of times. If the virus had been altered, there would be evidence in its genome.

Editor’s note, May 20, 2021: When this fact-check was first published in October 2020, PolitiFact’s sources included researchers who asserted the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have been manipulated. That assertion is now more widely disputed. Read our May 2021 report for more on the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. That dispute notwithstanding, the claim that COVID-19 was constructed at the Wuhan institute remains False.
Facing a tight reelection race, U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., turned to an anti-China media outlet to pitch his bill seeking to designate the Chinese Communist Party as a transnational organized crime group.
His interviewer was Simone Gao, who is affiliated with The Epoch Times and sister TV station NTD News.
In the Oct. 17 interview, posted a few weeks after Perry introduced his bill, Gao turned to COVID-19. She asked Perry what has been the effect of President Donald Trump’s contracting the virus.
Perry said Trump’s recovery ""gives us hope as Americans in our ability to conquer the virus that came from China, in my opinion, was constructed in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and then was spread around the world, either by accident or on purpose."" 
Perry’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests for information to back his statement.
Despite numerous such claims, there is no evidence that the coronavirus was created at the Chinese institute.

Perry, in Congress since 2013, is being challenged by Democrat Eugene DePasquale, the state’s auditor general, for the seat  representing Pennsylvania’s 10th congressional district, which surrounds Harrisburg, the state capital.

No evidence virus made in a lab
Here’s what we know from having fact-checked several claims that the virus that causes COVID-19 was created in a lab — a conspiracy theory that has been debunked since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic:


The consensus of the scientific community and international public health organizations is that the coronavirus emerged from bats and later jumped to humans. The first outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China.


Scientists worldwide have publicly shared the genetic makeup of the coronavirus thousands of times. If the virus had been altered in a lab, there would be evidence in its genome. But there isn’t.


That doesn’t rule out the possibility that Chinese researchers were studying the virus in a lab when it managed to spread outside the lab, which is something that the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has considered. But the agency has also said there is ""no credible evidence to indicate SARS-CoV-2 was released intentionally or was created as a biological weapon.""


Our ruling
Perry said the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was ""constructed"" in a Wuhan, China, lab.
There’s no evidence to support this. Scientists who’ve studied the virus’s genetic makeup say that it is a naturally occuring virus.
We rate Perry’s statement False.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The source of the claim appears to be an April 7 Instagram post from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and one of the biggest sources of anti-vaccine advertisements on Facebook. The post was subsequently covered by the BL, a pro-Trump website that has been known to publish misinformation.
We found no credible news reports about  496,000 paralyzed children in India due to a polio vaccine.
The Gates Foundation has long funded groups in India and elsewhere that seek to expand access to polio immunization. In March 2014, the World Health Organization declared that its Southeast Asia region was polio-free, in part because of the kinds of mass vaccination campaigns supported by the Gates Foundation. However, the virus remains a threat in South Asian countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan.
According to the WHO, it is possible to contract polio from vaccines — but it’s extremely rare. The agency estimates that 1 in 2.7 million oral doses results in vaccine-associated paralytic polio.
Since the eradication of polio in India, there have been some scares of tainted vaccines. But data from the WHO show that, between 2000 and 2017, there were 17 cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus.

If Your Time is short





Newsom has not been vacationing in Stevensville in recent weeks, his office said. The Montana governor’s office and Stevensville mayor said the same thing.





See the sources for this fact-check




As states begin to reopen in the face of the coronavirus, social media users are falsely claiming California Gov. Gavin Newsom defied his own stay-at-home order to vacation in Montana.
""While California is dying, not because of COVID, but because of the Newsom/Democrat lockdown, I hear Gavin is vacationing in Stevensville, MT!"" said a May 18 Facebook post, adding that locals should ""tape confirmation and share their videos.""
RELATED: The false TikTok claim that high unemployment is killing more people than the coronavirus
The post accused Newsom of being ""a criminal"" and included an image that showed the governor with his arm raised alongside the words: ""You stay while I vacation."" 
It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the Associated Press, social media users have been claiming Newsom fled to Montana for weeks.
The content of the post is wrong. For starters, COVID-19 has killed thousands of Californians — more than 3,600 as of May 22, according to Johns Hopkins University. More to the point, Newsom is not on vacation in Montana, nor has he been there in recent weeks.
""The governor and his family have been in California for the duration of the pandemic,"" said Jesse Melgar, Newsom’s press secretary.
Newsom’s whereabouts
Newsom has provided live updates about the state of the coronavirus in California throughout May, broadcasting them to his YouTube channel and social media pages. On May 18, he gave a press conference from Mustards Grill, a restaurant in Napa, California.
Montana officials said they’re not aware of any recent trips Newsom has made to their state.
""Gov. Newsom was not in Montana to our knowledge,"" said Erin Loranger, press secretary for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.

""We can confirm that Gov. Newsom has not been in Stevensville,"" added Stevensville Mayor Brandon Dewey.
We searched Google and the Nexis news database and found no credible reports to indicate that Newsom has been to Montana in recent weeks. Other fact-checkers and local news outlets also concluded that posts saying Newsom went there were wrong.
California law dictates that Newsom must be within the state’s borders to have the powers of his office, according to the Los Angeles Times. When Newsom has left California in the past, he has typically transferred the governor’s duties to Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis.
""When the governor leaves the state, he is required to give notice, and the lieutenant governor serves as acting governor in his absence,"" said Katie Hanzlik, a spokesperson for Kounalakis.
But Kounalakis’ office hasn’t received notice that Newsom would be out of California since early February, Hanzlik said. She shared with PolitiFact a pair of press releases, from Feb. 7 and Feb 11, that said Newsom ""has left the state"" and ""has returned to the state.""  
On Feb. 10, Newsom appeared as a guest on ABC’s ""The View,"" which is filmed in New York.
The parents of Newsom’s wife, filmmaker and actress Jennifer Siebel Newsom, do own a ranch near Stevensville. The two got married there in 2008, when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco, according to an Associated Press report from the time.  
Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on March 19, and he recently loosened the criteria that counties must meet in order to begin easing some restrictions.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said, ""While California is dying … Gavin (Newsom) is vacationing in Stevensville, MT!""
There is no evidence of this. Newsom’s office said he has not been vacationing in Stevensville, and so did the lieutenant governor’s office, the Montana governor’s office and the Stevensville mayor. Newsom gave a live press conference from a California restaurant on May 18, the day the post went up.

Robin Vos","Wisconsin Assembly speaker says state passed one of the first COVID-19 bills, but that’s wrong




If Your Time is short





Thirty-six states and territories had adopted or enacted 174 COVID-19-related measures before Evers signed Wisconsin’s relief package. 


Evers already had the authority to declare health emergencies, issue orders and spend federal aid before the pandemic hit. The relief bill didn’t add to that.





See the sources for this fact-check




Gov. Tony Evers and Republican legislative leaders are back at the drawing table after months without speaking to each other in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.
Evers met with Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and incoming Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu on Nov. 20, 2020, to discuss the governor’s proposed COVID-19 relief package. The meeting came days after Vos held a news conference to discuss ""new legislative initiatives.""
The talking and jockeying comes as the state’s case counts continue to rise, with daily deaths topping 100 for the first time on Nov. 24, 2020.
In a Nov. 22, 2020, interview with WKOW, Vos expressed a desire to find common ground with the governor and put politics behind them. But his comments took a partisan tone as he shifted the blame for months of inaction away from Republicans. 
""We passed one of the first (COVID-19) bills in the entire country, empowering Gov. Evers to act,"" he said. 
Is Vos’ recounting of history correct?
One of the first?
Evers signed a COVID-19 relief package on April 15, 2020, the day it reached his desk and 14 days after Republicans first began drafting legislation and weeks after the governor offered his own proposal to legislative leaders. 
By then, many other states had already begun tackling the pandemic.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 36 states and territories had adopted or enacted 174 COVID-19-related measures by April 14. Nearly 60 were resolutions that didn’t carry the weight of law but handled legislative housekeeping and, in Alabama, urged residents to bump fists instead of shaking hands. 
The remainder were bills that governed the pandemic response in the respective states.
Alaska and Massachusetts changed rules around unemployment benefits. New Jersey banned evictions during public health emergencies. Minnesota and Vermont enacted comprehensive response packages. Several legislatures moved money around to manage the pandemic, while others addressed specific issues such as student meals, price gouging and coverage for telehealth services.

Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed to the database as evidence for the speaker’s claim, but in reality, it undermines his position.  
Empowering Evers
The rest of Vos’ claim suggests the COVID-19 relief package empowered Evers to act.
""The legislation gave the governor broad authority to respond to the coronavirus and ensured that Wisconsin received more federal dollars, especially in the areas of unemployment insurance and health care (Medicaid) funding,"" Beyer said.
But this too is off base.
The relief package did facilitate the transfer of CARES Act funds, allowing the state to capture additional federal Medicaid dollars. But $25 million in federal funding for unemployment went out the window because lawmakers didn’t pass a piece of legislation quickly enough.
What’s more, state statute already granted Evers the authority to declare public health emergencies, issue orders and distribute $2 billion in federal dollars without the legislature’s approval. The relief bill didn’t do any of that.
Our ruling
In a recent interview, Vos claimed ""we passed one of the first (COVID-19) bills in the entire country, empowering Gov. Evers to act.""
This is wrong on both fronts. 
Wisconsin lagged behind many other states in passing COVID-19 legislation, to the point where lawmakers lost out on federal aid for unemployment. And Evers’ ability to manage health emergencies came from state law already in place when the pandemic hit.

Tucker Carlson","Tucker Carlson’s misleading claim about deaths after COVID-19 vaccine




If Your Time is short





Tucker Carlson was citing data from the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database, or VAERS. The VAERS system is open to anyone, and reports to it are not verified, making it a breeding ground for misinformation about vaccine safety.


The entries in the VAERS database are not enough to determine whether a vaccine causes death or any other adverse event, experts said. People can die after getting vaccinated for any number of reasons unrelated to the vaccine.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed the death reports submitted to VAERS through May 3 and concluded that there’s no “causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.”





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that thousands of Americans have died since December because of the COVID-19 vaccines, citing an unverified federal database that has become a breeding ground for anti-vaccine misinformation.
The comments were the latest in a series of controversial remarks by Carlson raising doubts about the vaccines, which clinical trials and real-world studies have shown both safe and effective. 
""Between late December of 2020 and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccine in the United States — 3,362,"" Carlson told millions of viewers during his primetime TV show May 5. ""That’s an average of roughly 30 people every day.""
""The actual number is almost certainly higher than that, perhaps vastly higher than that,"" he added. ""It’s clear that what is happening now, for whatever reason, is not even close to normal.""
Carlson said he was citing numbers from the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, an open-source database often misused by anti-vaccine activists to make false claims about vaccine safety. Experts rejected Carlson’s claim as misleading.
That’s because VAERS data is considered unreliable for drawing causal conclusions. And dying after a vaccine is not the same thing as dying because of the vaccine.
""It is exceptionally irresponsible for this man to claim that all these are causal associations. It’s wrong,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, the chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. ""He puts people’s lives at risk with bad information during a pandemic.""
VAERS reports are unverified and don’t show causation
Unlike other official government sources, which flow through consistent reporting channels and get screened by statisticians and analysts before they are made available to the public, VAERS is an open-access system. The reports submitted are not verified before they become public.
""Anybody can report to it,"" Offit said. ""If I get a vaccine, or I give my child a vaccine, and I believe that they have turned into the ‘Incredible Hulk,’ then I can write up a one-page report online and submit it, and that then is included. And that’s been done.""
A disclaimer on the VAERS website says the ""reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness,"" in part because they ""may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information."" People accessing the database must click an option that says that they’ve read and understand the disclaimer.
Offit said VAERS works best as ""a hypothesis-generating mechanism"" that can tip scientists off to issues for further study, such as the rare cases of blood clots that prompted the agency to recommend a temporary pause on use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. 
In this case, the CDC has analyzed all the reports of death among COVID-19 vaccine recipients that were submitted to VAERS between Dec. 14, 2020, and May 3. 
""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the agency concluded.
To establish causation, scientists need to find proof that an adverse event is significantly more common among vaccinated people than unvaccinated people. VAERS doesn’t provide enough data to do that.

By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







As of May 5, nearly 150 million Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and many of the early shots went to older and more vulnerable people.
""When you’re giving a COVID-19 vaccine to elderly adults, there are going to be people who die shortly after vaccination because they would have died anyway,"" Dr. William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’s International Vaccine Access Center, previously told PolitiFact.
An estimated 8,000 Americans die every day of all causes, according to the CDC.
Offit cited the case of baseball legend Hank Aaron, who died of natural causes — likely a stroke — weeks after getting his shot. Social media posts falsely claimed the vaccine killed him.
""You can get the vaccine and still die from other reasons,"" Offit said.
After his segment baselessly linking the COVID-19 vaccines to ""roughly 30"" deaths per day, Carlson interviewed Martin Kulldorff, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Kulldorff told Carlson that VAERS is ""not a very useful system,"" in part because it doesn’t take into account ""what is expected by chance"" in terms of adverse reactions.
Carlson has questioned the vaccines and U.S. vaccination efforts on several occasions. In April, we rated Pants on Fire his claim that, ""Maybe it doesn’t work, and they’re simply not telling you that."" Fox News defended that statement by pointing to other instances where Carlson claimed to support vaccines, such as when he said he is ""pretty pro-vaccine.""
Elsewhere in his May 5 segment, Carlson similarly said the ""vaccines aren’t dangerous"" based on ""the official numbers.""
But his claim about thousands of deaths is wrong. On Facebook, a video of the claim was viewed more than 155,000 times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. 
The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Our ruling
Carlson said, ""Between late December of 2020 and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccine in the United States … The actual number is almost certainly higher.""
That’s highly misleading. The source of Carlson’s numbers is the VAERS database, which is often exploited by anti-vaccine activists to make false vaccine claims. The CDC analyzed the VAERS death reports and concluded that there’s no ""causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" 
People can die after getting vaccinated for any number of reasons unrelated to the vaccine.

Ron DeSantis","DeSantis falsely claims he was never asked about COVID-19




If Your Time is short




DeSantis held multiple press conferences in May where reporters asked him many pandemic-related questions about unemployment, reopening plans, testing and outbreaks.




See the sources for this fact-check




Gov. Ron DeSantis has a new narrative about Florida’s rising COVID-19 numbers: As cases leveled off in May, the media stopped covering the story, and the public grew complacent.
DeSantis made this case during his July 2 meeting in Tampa with Vice President Mike Pence, where he said that the pandemic ""fell out of the news."" at the end of May and beginning of June.
A week earlier, DeSantis said the media had returned its attention to the pandemic as the caseload grew in June amid reopenings of restaurants, shops and beaches.
""Well, I think now this is back in the news. I think people understand. Look, it was natural. It wasn’t much, I mean, I would do press events in May, I would never be asked about coronavirus,"" DeSantis said June 26. ""It was about all these other things. Now it’s something that they are (asking about).""
The other major news story that swept the nation and Florida starting in late May was the protests about police brutality and racism that followed George Floyd’s killing in police custody. As Florida journalists covered weeks of protests across the state, media outlets continued their pandemic coverage. In the week following Floyd’s death, we found news articles about Florida’s COVID-19 case numbers, reopenings of beaches and gyms in Broward, a photo gallery of pandemic life in Jacksonville, updates on openings and closings in southwest Florida, and the impact of the pandemic on hurricane planning, just to name a few of thousands of examples we found in Nexis.
Reporters pushed back against DeSantis, so we wanted to look into it. 
We found that multiple transcripts of DeSantis press conferences in May show reporters asking him about lifting COVID-19 restrictions on businesses, the state’s rising unemployment and flawed benefits system, the plan for addressing spikes, and outbreaks in nursing homes and prisons. 
We sent a link to those transcripts to spokespersons for DeSantis and asked what he was referring to when he said he wasn’t asked about the coronavirus. We did not get a response to our emails or phone messages.
Some of the COVID-19 questions
The press conferences we reviewed showed DeSantis taking questions about COVID-19, even if that wasn’t the main topic of the event. Reporters asked him about the pandemic at press conferences on judicial appointments and a road construction project.
We found at least a dozen times reporters asked DeSantis about COVID-19 in May. Here are a few examples. For our review, we used the transcript service Rev.com and video from the Florida Channel, a public affairs programming service based at the state Capitol.

May 8: A reporter asked a question about the phases of reopening in South Florida. 
May 11: DeSantis faced questions about people awaiting unemployment checks and the state’s unemployment website. A reporter started to ask a question about one of the covid case models that the state was looking at and DeSantis interjected: ""Has that been accurate so far?

Facebook posts","Herd immunity curbed COVID deaths? No




If Your Time is short





Once a high percentage of people have been infected with a virus or vaccinated — in other words, herd immunity is achieved — spread of the virus can be stopped or greatly slowed.


Despite having a population twice that of New York State, California has experienced only a fraction of the number of COVID-19 deaths.


There’s no evidence herd immunity has limited coronavirus deaths in California, which adopted stay-at-home measures before New York did.





See the sources for this fact-check




There is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. 
So, is it possible a naturally occurring ""herd immunity"" has, in effect, inoculated much of California, keeping the number of the state’s coronavirus deaths a fraction of those in New York?
That’s the claim of a lengthy Facebook post, titled ""CV-19 Hoax Update."" It starts with this:
""Do you wonder why CA only has 559 CV19 deaths compared to 7,067 deaths in NY? Welp, researchers at Stanford's School of Medicine suspect it's because CA had already developed ‘herd immunity’ to the virus. They're now conducting a study to find this out. Makes sense. … Building ‘herd immunity’ is the only way to get rid of a virus when there is no vaccine.""
The post also claims that California is a leading tourist destination for people from China and theorizes that the virus has been ""kicking around"" California ""since October or November."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Herd immunity, also called ""herd protection,"" is a real phenomenon. It’s when the percentage of the population immune to a virus becomes so high that the virus virtually dies off. But experts, pointing to how relatively little testing is being done, say there is no evidence of herd immunity for COVID-19 anywhere, let alone just in California.
New York deaths far higher
The numbers of COVID-19 deaths cited in the April 10 Facebook post — 559 in California and 7,067 — were accurate. News reports at the time cited those figures from Johns Hopkins University. 
That means New York had more than 12 times as many coronavirus deaths, even though its population is only about one-half that of California.
What is herd immunity?
Think of herd immunity as being a situation in which so many people — above 50% to perhaps 70% — are immune to a virus that it essentially stops spreading.
It occurs when enough people in a community become immune through vaccination and/or prior illness, making the spread of the disease from person to person unlikely, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology says.
The theory is that once many people develop immunity, the virus will eventually stop spreading to people who haven’t yet caught it. 
It’s not easy to achieve. 
Based on testing, even hard-hit Wuhan, China, where the virus was first detected Dec. 31, 2019, isn’t close to achieving herd immunity, the Wall Street Journal reported on April 16, 2020.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







And in the days after the Facebook post, California Gov. Gavin Newsom talked about herd immunity as an aspiration for his state, not as something that has spared it.
The Stanford study
The Facebook post argues that it makes sense that California would have herd immunity because so many people travel there from China. It alludes to a Stanford University study as evidence.
That study, which tested for coronavirus antibodies among 3,300 people in Santa Clara County, Calif., on April 3 and 4, 2020, was aimed at determining how many people in the county had unknowingly been infected with the virus, but didn’t become seriously sick. 
Newsom said the project would show ""how far away we are from herd immunity.""
The study concluded that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases — an estimated 48,000 to 81,000 people were infected in the county by early April, 50 to 85 times more than the number of confirmed cases. That’s likely due to several factors, including early spread, lack of systematic testing, and asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic cases that were previously undetected, the study said.
But the study’s findings are not evidence that California has herd immunity, Dr. David Hamer, an expert on infectious diseases and global health and medicine professor at Boston University, told PolitiFact.
No evidence of herd immunity
Experts told PolitiFact that, because relatively little COVID-19 testing has been done, there simply is no evidence of herd immunity for COVID-19.
""We just don't have the testing data yet to determine who is protected. So, we are still not there in terms of declaring herd immunity,"" said Melissa Brown, professor of microbiology/immunology at Northwestern University. 
Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University in New York, agreed.
""Since almost all of the testing is done only on sick (symptomatic) people, presumably due to limitations in testing capacity, and only a very few counties are testing more widely, we don’t know the level of immunity in either California or New York,"" he said. ""Therefore, we can’t say anything about herd immunity, as we simply don’t know.""
While the federal and state governments are building up their testing capabilities, ""it’s not clear how good all these tests are,"" said Hamer. ""And we don’t have a clearly defined test to tell whether a person has had the disease"" and also has antibodies to protect from getting COVID-19 again.
As a number of news reports have suggested, experts also told us that one explanation for California’s lower death toll is that it adopted stay-at-home orders and other responses before New York did.
Our ruling
A widely shared post on Facebook claims herd immunity is probably why California has far fewer COVID-19 deaths than New York.
Experts say that with relatively little testing having been done, there is no evidence to indicate that herd immunity explains the large gap in coronavirus deaths in the two states.

The study featured in the article is from 2019 and the data for it was collected in 2017-18, so it doesn’t include COVID-19 information.


In past fact-checks, experts said this connection between the flu vaccine and other viruses is still speculative.

We have debunked plenty of misinformation about vaccines for COVID-19 that are in development. Next up: more false information tying COVID-19 to the seasonal flu vaccine.

Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The article, from a self-described ""conscious media"" website, mainly cites a 2019 study from the U.S. Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch that was published in the journal Vaccine in 2020. The study focused on Department of Defense personnel, who have high rates of flu vaccination, and examined whether being vaccinated for a seasonal flu could make someone more or less likely to catch other respiratory viruses.
But the study found no connection between the flu shot and an increased risk of contracting COVID-19.

That’s because the U.S. Armed Forces study’s data was referring to seasonal common coronaviruses in 2017-18, not the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. (There are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, of which the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 is one.) This was clarified in the full article, but is ambiguous in the headline.
What’s more, Richard Watanabe, a preventative medicine professor at USC, told PolitiFact that the article doesn’t really provide ""strong support for anything they are claiming"" since the study found little correlation between the flu vaccine and such viruses. 
Even with regard to coronaviruses that predated SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. Armed Forces study concluded that further research is needed, as ""the overall results of the study showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination."" The study’s data had mixed results for individual respiratory viruses and found that vaccinated individuals were ""more likely to have no pathogen detected and reduced risk of influenza when compared to unvaccinated individuals.""
The article also leaves out parts of the study that question the data linking coronavirus cases to the influenza vaccine. For instance, the U.S. Armed Forces study referenced a study from 2013 that had similar results except there was ""no association between influenza vaccination and RSV, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus or coronavirus."" 
Edward Belongia, an infectious disease epidemiologist who worked on the 2013 study, explained to FactCheck.org that there is little scientific data to support the speculative theory of the flu vaccine increasing the risk of other respiratory viruses.

The Trump administration on July 10 did order hospitals to bypass the CDC and send COVID-19 patient information to the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump administration officials say the change will streamline data gathering, but the HHS database is not open to the public, which could affect the work of health officials who relied on the CDC database, the New York Times reported.

In a reply to her tweet, Lorraine cited what she said were the ""sources"" for a her claim, including: a report that a Florida motorcyclist’s death had been added to the COVID-19 and then was removed; a partially debunked claim that hospitals are paid $13,000 for the admission of a COVID-19 patient and $39,000 if the patient goes on a ventilator; and her own statement that the CDC has admitted that it includes pneumonia and seasonal flu in its count of COVID-19 cases.
Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that similar claims were made in June. ""The claim was false then and is still false now. I’m not even sure where those numbers come from. They seem to have been pulled out of thin air,"" he said.
As of July 27, the day we published this fact-check, Florida had nearly 419,000 cases, according to the CDC.
The CDC counts as COVID-19 cases those patients whose cases are confirmed by testing as well as those that are considered ""probable"", CDC spokesman Jason McDonald told us. According to the epidemiological standards, a ""probable"" case is one that meets clinical criteria and epidemiologic evidence even though there hasn’t been testing; one in which antigens or antibodies have been detected and the person meets clinical criteria or there is epidemiologic evidence; or, one in which a death certificate lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of death or a significant contributing factor.
Cases that involve pneumonia or flu but not COVID-19 are not included in COVID-19 counts, McDonald said. 
However, a case would be included if, for example, a patient gets pneumonia that was caused by COVID-19, Anderson said.
The CDC gets its Florida case counts from the Florida Department of Health, and no change from 90,000 to 11,000 was made, McDonald told PolitiFact.

There is still no way of knowing what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like

 




See the sources for this fact-check




We’ve seen many social media posts lately that falsely claim Bill Gates is responsible for, or will somehow profit from, COVID-19.
Most claims are focused on the coronavirus vaccine. The Gates Foundation has been financially supporting the development of a vaccine and posting articles explaining the projected vaccine timeline.
A recent Facebook post links to an article titled, ""Bill Gates Explains That The COVID Vaccine Will Use Experimental Technology And Permanently Alter Your DNA."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Waking Times blog post heavily quotes Bill Gates’ blog, specifically when he explains how RNA COVID-19 vaccines could be developed and how they would create antibodies. 
RNA vaccines have been shown to create ""a safe and long-lasting immune response in animal models and humans""  in clinical and preclinical trials. However, licensed RNA vaccines have never been produced before. 
The body creates proteins by translating mRNA, the messenger molecules from DNA. By introducing a new mRNA vaccine to a few cells in the human body, those cells will produce the proteins of ""a disease-specific antigen,"" and the immune system can create an antigen-specific antibody. Basically, it creates only the parts of a pathogen that the body reacts to and creates antibodies to bond to. This way, the body can easily attack the disease when it recognizes its cells.

The second half of this claim, that these vaccines would ""permanently alter your DNA"" is incorrect. An article in Frontiers on Immunology analyzed new studies that found mRNA ""cannot potentially integrate into the host genome and will be degraded naturally."" Basically, after the messenger molecules create antigens for the body to react to, they will naturally stop being used and break down.
The Waking Times blog shared on Facebook asserts that a new COVID-19 RNA vaccine ""will not be tested in any significant or standard capacity"" and that readers should prepare to be ""guinea pigs in the largest global health experiment ever.""
But Gates makes it very clear throughout his own blog post that scientists are not just relying on RNA or DNA experiments to create the first worldwide COVID-19 vaccine. ""As of April 9, there are 115 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline,"" Gates writes. RNA and DNA vaccines are easier to produce and they are testing them right now, but ""even if an RNA vaccine continues to show promise, we still must continue pursuing the other options.""
Contrary to the explosive claim that the entire world would be treated as ""guinea pigs"" for a new RNA or DNA vaccine, Gates explains how any COVID-19 vaccine will go through a rigorous, but also shortened, testing period. The New England Journal of Medicine has projected that they can shorten the usual 5-year period of vaccine testing to three short testing trials over 18 months. Gates says later in his article that it’s a priority to ""make sure we have good real-world evidence that the vaccine is completely safe to use.""
RNA testing will be done on small groups before it reaches the entire world. The first round of clinical testing with an RNA vaccine for COVID-19 began on May 16th. The dosage test has only 105 subjects and is projected to take at least a year to complete.
Our Ruling
A blog post shared on social media reads ""Bill Gates Explains That The COVID Vaccine Will Use Experimental Technology And Permanently Alter Your DNA.""
This is inaccurate. Gates never said that the first licensed COVID-19 vaccine would use experimental technology or permanently alter DNA; he said specifically that ""we don’t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like.""

San Francisco spent about $1,500 per month on physician-prescribed alcohol for some homeless people it kept isolated in hotels during the pandemic.


The program is slated to end in June.


No tax dollars were ever spent on marijuana.

The Democrats and President Joe Biden are making a full court press to tell Americans about the many ways their COVID-19 relief package will put money in their pockets.
Republicans are working just as hard to paint the $1.9 trillion law as a colossal waste of government funds.
""Nancy Pelosi’s Bay Area Bailout included $600 million for San Francisco, part of which goes to cover the tab for free alcohol and marijuana for the homeless,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted March 14. ""I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this bailout is too costly, corrupt, and liberal.""

Does the federal relief package really pay for San Francisco to provide free weed and booze for the homeless?
Let’s sort this out.
City officials say the American Rescue Plan Act — which contains $360 billion in aid to state and local governments — will send San Francisco about $600 million over the next two years. The city can decide how to spend the money to help recover from damage wrought by the pandemic. 
McCarthy mangled the facts in tying the relief package to what’s taking place with people — not just homeless people — whom the city puts up in hotels to isolate them when they’ve been exposed to the coronavirus.
Isolating people in the spring
After a COVID-19 outbreak at a San Francisco homeless shelter in April 2020, the city moved to isolate more homeless people in hotels. The isolation and quarantine program grew to include people who weren’t homeless but who lived in cramped quarters where it was impossible to stay away from others. 
In May, word spread that staff were providing some of these people with marijuana and alcohol. A local activist went on Twitter to call out the practice, and the city public health department defended itself.
""These harm-reduction based practices, which are not unique to San Francisco, and are not paid for with taxpayer money, help guests successfully complete isolation and quarantine and have significant individual and public health benefits in the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the department tweeted May 5, 2020.
A flawed news report miscast a statement from the health department as indicating that it provided marijuana.
Part of the confusion was that the city’s practices involving alcohol were separate from those involving marijuana. 
Let’s look at the alcohol policy first.

Jenna Lane, a spokeswoman for the city health department, told us that the key to isolating people during a pandemic is to keep them in their rooms. For homeless people with severe alcoholism, going cold turkey was a health risk.
""Medical providers prescribed limited amounts of alcohol to be served with a meal to just those guests who would otherwise go into alcohol withdrawal,"" Lane said. ""Alcohol withdrawal can be fatal.""
Some alcoholics got vodka, some got beer. Lane said these people represented a small fraction of the homeless whom the city took care of in its isolation and quarantine program. City staff supported everyone who was in recovery and helped them stay substance-free.
As of the time of this fact-check, there were 23 people in isolation and quarantine. San Francisco provides alcohol only in the isolation and quarantine program.
Until May 4, 2020, the city relied on private donations to pay for the vodka and beer for residents. In the ensuing 10 months, the city spent $14,940 in public funds to provide alcohol, or about $1,500 each month.
Lane said the city never paid for marijuana. 
Some people in the city’s isolation program used marijuana while quarantining in a city-provided hotel room. California allows personal use of marijuana.
 These residents paid for the drug themselves. 
""If someone had a prescription for medical cannabis, staff might receive prescription deliveries at the front entrance of the hotel,"" Lane said. ""They would accept it on behalf of a guest. But no staff facilitated recreational purchases.""
In November, the city announced measures to relocate about 2,300 people who were then staying in hotels. The goal was to end the hotel program by the end of June 2021.
Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, told us, ""There are no federal funds being used for these purposes.""
We reached out to McCarthy’s office and did not hear back.
Our ruling
McCarthy said the federal relief package has ""$600 million for San Francisco, part of which goes to cover the tab for free alcohol and marijuana for the homeless.""
Since May 2020, San Francisco has spent about $1,500 of public money each month to provide medically prescribed alcohol to people with severe alcoholism in COVID-19 isolation and quarantine sites for homeless people. No federal money has been allotted to this program, which is due to end in June.
The city does not provide marijuana to people at quarantine sites.
McCarthy’s claim misrepresented what’s in the federal relief package.

Melissa Melendez","California Lawmaker Makes ‘Oversimplified, Untrue’ Claim About COVID-19 And Lack Of Risk To Children




If Your Time is short





A California state lawmaker claimed there is “no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID.” 


Medical experts say that’s just plain wrong.


There are studies that have examined children and found they are at risk of COVID-19, albeit less risk than adults.


There’s also a lack of data and uncertainty about how much children could spread the coronavirus among teachers, family members and the wider community once schools reopen.





See the sources for this fact-check




A California state lawmaker jumped into the national debate on whether to reopen schools this fall amid the rapid spread of COVID-19, by claiming there’s no evidence children are in harm’s way. 
""There is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID,"" Republican state Sen. Melissa Melendez tweeted on Thursday.  
Melendez, who represents much of Riverside County, went on to argue for a full reopening.
""Students should return to school, in person, and all school sports/activities should resume. Let’s stop robbing our kids of the education we owe them. We can do this safely."" 

We won’t put a Truth-O-Meter rating on the second half of her tweet because it’s her opinion. But the first part makes a claim about the facts. 
Are there really no COVID-19 studies showing a risk to children?
We decided to check that out.  
Our research
Benjamin Linas is an associate professor of epidemiology and an infectious disease physician at Boston University School of Medicine. He wrote a recent article in Vox advocating for the reopening of schools this fall.
But when asked about Melendez’s claim, he called it ""an oversimplification and untrue."" 
""There absolutely are studies of COVID-19 risk in children. It is silly to say that kids do not have risk,"" Linas wrote in an email. ""The good news is that medical consensus at this time, based on data, is that children generally have a mild form of COVID and that many are asymptomatic. Overall, if your child contracts COVID, they will be OK. That is good news. But to take that and say that kids are ‘not at risk’ is an oversimplification and untrue. Some children have died of COVID, some have been in ICUs.""
In his Vox article, Linas pointed to public health reporting that showed children under the age of 18 made up only 2% of coronavirus cases in the United States, even though they represent 22% of the total population. 
He wrote that similar studies in Chicago and Massachusetts found that children make up fewer COVID-19 cases than anticipated, as have studies in Italy, South Korea, and Iceland.
Looking at data nationally and worldwide at the end of May, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded: ""Based on these early studies, children of all ages are at risk for COVID-19; however, complications of COVID-19 appear to be less common among children compared with adults based on limited reports from China and the U.S.""
Lee Riley, professor and chair of infectious disease and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, also disputed Melendez’s claim.

""This lawmaker is wrong,"" Riley wrote in an email. ""Though rare, there are well documented cases of severe complications kids develop with COVID-19. In Europe and the US, several cases of Kawasaki-like disease have been reported. (New York City) had about 100 cases with 3 deaths.""
Riley is referring to a rare but serious condition found in young people this spring known as Multisystem-Inflammatory Syndrome. Doctors in Europe and the United States have attributed it to complications linked to COVID-19. 
While the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is low for children, the professor added that ""kids can serve as a reservoir for transmission to their parents and other relatives. Parents who may have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other underlying medical conditions will be at risk for severe complications and even death.""
When asked about the claim in question, a spokesperson for Sen. Melendez said her tweet was based on statements made at recent White House Coronavirus Task Force events. He acknowledged ""the exact phrasing"" of those statements ""is not the same"" as the senator’s tweet.
Here’s a sample: 


""We really don’t have evidence that children are driving the transmission cycle of this,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield stated on Wednesday at the task force briefing. 


""Children are less likely to become infected and they are less likely to spread infection,"" American Academy of Pediatrics President Sally Goza said at a White House event on Tuesday.


Those statements line up with what other health experts have said. But they don’t specifically support Melendez’s broad claim ""There is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID."" 
A day after Goza’s remarks, White House health advisor Dr. Deborah Birx disputed the idea that children have been proven to be less likely to spread COVID-19, saying there’s not enough data to arrive at that conclusion, CNBC reported.
Looking at the age groups tested in the United States, ""the lowest tested portion is the under-10-year-olds,"" Birx said Wednesday.
""There’s no data one way or the other right now,"" to determine how much children will spread the disease, added UC Berkeley’s Dr. Riley, in a follow-up phone interview.

As one infectious disease expert put it, some ""children have died of COVID, some have been in ICUs."" 
While children aren’t at a high risk for complications of the coronavirus, experts said the data is not yet clear about their role in transmitting it. There’s a tense debate nationally about whether reopening schools will lead to a greater spread of COVID-19 not just among children but also among family members and wider communities. 
That debate is still playing out. What’s clear is that Melendez went too far in her claim, reducing a complicated topic to an oversimplified, unsupported tweet.

There is no evidence to support the video. Most of the deaths caused by the 2019 coronavirus have been associated with respiratory problems, not sudden death syndrome.
The video comes from a Facebook page called Stranger Than Fiction News, which is managed by three users in Australia, according to Facebook’s Page Transparency feature. The account in recent weeks has uploaded several videos with unproven or fabricated claims about the coronavirus.
Since its December outbreak in Wuhan, China, the 2019 coronavirus has spread rapidly around the world. According to the World Health Organization, more than 43,000 people have been infected in 24 countries. In China, 1,017 have died.

Researchers still don’t know much about the clinical severity of the coronavirus. Many people recover within a few days, but some, such as young, elderly or immunocompromised people, may develop more serious infections, like bronchitis or pneumonia.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 2019 coronavirus causes symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath. That’s similar to coronaviruses like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which causes ""rapidly progressive pneumonitis, respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure resulting in death.""

Sudden death syndrome, on the other hand, is a ""series of cardiac syndromes that cause sudden cardiac arrest and possibly death,"" according to Healthline. Some syndromes are caused by structural problems in the heart, while others are a result of electrical irregularities.
There is no evidence that the coronavirus causes sudden death syndrome.
A Jan. 30 study of 99 coronavirus cases found that the virus ""can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome."" Three-quarters of the patients in the study showed signs of double pneumonia, and the characteristics of those who died were consistent with a warning model that predicts who’s most likely to die from the disease.
Some patients did die after experiencing heart problems, including cardiac arrest, but the study did not establish a link between the virus and sudden death syndrome.

If Your Time is short





Despite a dip in death rates, which are expected to rise again, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still considers COVID-19 an epidemic.


Death rates alone don’t determine whether an outbreak is an epidemic.


 



See the sources for this fact-check




Amid news headlines that the United States set a daily record for the number of new coronavirus cases, an article widely shared on Facebook made a contrarian claim.
Referring to the lead federal agency fighting COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the article’s headline said:
""The CDC may have to stop calling COVID-19 an ‘epidemic’ due to a remarkably low death rate.""
The July 9 article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The claim is flawed in a number of ways.
What the article says
The article appears on the website of Collective Evolution, which describes itself as a ""conscious media company focused on personal transformation.""
The article claims the CDC might have to stop calling COVID-19 an epidemic because the death rate is becoming so low that it wouldn’t meet the CDC’s definition of epidemic. It does not cite any death rate figures. 
The article cites a CDC webpage, but that page does not refer to death rates in describing what an epidemic is. 
The CDC page says: ""Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.""
No CDC declarations
Health officials and leaders have made several official declarations about the novel coronavirus. But the major ones weren’t about declaring an epidemic, and none were made by the CDC:

Jan. 31: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declares a public health emergency.


March 11: The WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic.


March 13: President Donald Trump declares a national emergency.


What the CDC says
In its weekly summary of COVID-19 activity, the CDC gave no indication that a drop in deaths signaled a turning point. The latest report available when the Facebook post was made was for the week ended June 27. 
It said about death rates: 
""Mortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week and is currently at the epidemic threshold, but will likely increase as additional death certificates are processed.""
The same statement was made in the latest report, for the week ended July 4.
Here’s what that means, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told PolitiFact:
The epidemic threshold ""refers to the point at which the observed proportion of deaths is significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the absence of substantial influenza, and now COVID-related mortality."" Deaths are a lagging indicator of COVID-19, partly because of a delay in the processing of death certificates. Death rates alone don’t ""have bearing on whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic,"" given that the extent of the outbreak is the primary factor.
Our ruling
An article widely shared on Facebook claimed: ""The CDC may have to stop calling COVID-19 an ‘epidemic’ due to a remarkably low death rate.""
The latest CDC statement made public when the Facebook post was made said deaths attributed to COVID-19 decreased from the previous week, but remained at the epidemic threshold, and were likely to increase. Moreover, death rates alone do not define an epidemic.

Facebook posts","Conspiracy theory targets first recipient of UK COVID-19 vaccine as crisis actor




If Your Time is short





Images of Margaret Keenan receiving the first Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in the UK were not published in earlier articles by CNN, or any other news organization. 


The photos were taken the day of the event, on Dec. 8, and do not appear on the internet before then.


Those who spread the post misunderstood that some news websites, including CNN’s, will sometimes feature videos of other, unrelated stories on various article pages.





See the sources for this fact-check




On Dec. 8, 2020, news organizations around the world published stories about the first patient in the United Kingdom to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outside of trials: 90-year-old Margaret Keenan.
Along with the stories came images showing Keenan with her sleeve rolled up as she got the first dose at University Hospital in Coventry, England.
But it didn’t take long for some users on social media to start circulating a bogus conspiracy theory that suggested the story wasn’t legitimate, because the same images appeared online months earlier. 
""Excuse me but how is it the exact same person who’s the ‘first to get vaccinated’ today... also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October? Which one of these lying stories did you want us to pretend is true?"" Mindy Robinson, a conservative actress who lost a recent congressional run in Nevada, wrote on Twitter. 
Robinson’s tweet, which was re-shared on Facebook, includes screenshots of two different articles. 
One depicts a Dec. 8 BBC article that shows Keenan getting the shot, while the other appears to show an unrelated story by CNN published on Oct. 22, with the same images of Keenan receiving the vaccine.
But this is a misunderstanding of how some news websites, like CNN’s, will sometimes display the latest stories at the top of other, unrelated articles. Keenan is not an actor, and CNN did not publish photos of her receiving the vaccine in October.
Another post on Facebook also ambiguously claims that Keenan is a crisis actor because she apparently made a hand gesture that has been connected to the Illuminati, and by including screenshots of another, unnamed woman who is supposedly an actress.
There is no evidence that the images of the woman (or women, the grainy screenshot isn’t clear and may show more than one person) pictured is Keenan, or that her innocuous hand gesture signals something nefarious.

A reverse-image search shows that photos and videos of Keenan receiving the shot were not published before Dec. 8.
The Oct. 22 CNN story in the screenshot covered a report estimating that the U.S. COVID-19 response resulted in 130,000 to 210,000 avoidable deaths. It does not include any images of Keenan. 
Some article pages on CNN’s website display videos from other stories, often the most recent ones, underneath the headline. A reel showing a handful of videos, which currently includes the Dec. 8 vaccinations in the UK, is displayed under that.
These clips were not published at the same time as the Oct. 22 article, but simply feature other CNN segments that viewers can watch if they want.
Many conspiracy theories latch onto the flawed claim that people who appear in various news stories — often tragic events like mass shootings — are actually paid actors pushing a pre-ordained narrative. These types of theories have been, and continue to be, soundly debunked.

A social media post claims that images of Margaret Keenan receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the UK appeared in a CNN news story in October, despite the event taking place in early December.
This is wrong. Images of Keenan receiving the vaccine were not published in earlier articles by CNN, or any other news organization. They were taken on Dec. 8, and do not appear online before then.

In his emails, Fauci acknowledged the existence of anecdotal evidence claiming hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness against COVID-19 but never endorsed it himself and said he was waiting for results from a clinical trial for any definitive proof.

 
The clinical trial ended last June after researchers found the drug provided no additional benefit in treating the virus.

The release of thousands of emails sent and received by Dr. Anthony Fauci during the onset of the pandemic has provided new fuel for online misinformation.
A Facebook post from June 2 claims Fauci knew about hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness against COVID -19. The post is an image of distorted text that is also copied word-for-word in the caption.
""So he (knew) hydroxychloroquine worked … emailed friends about it being effective,"" it reads.
It then goes on to say the drug should be placed in every shop so that people can ""get on with life and pretend this (pandemic) never happened.""

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021








(Screenshot from Facebook)
 
While no specific emails were mentioned in the Facebook post, it is seemingly in reference to the release of more than 3,200 messages sent or received by Fauci from the first half of 2020. The emails were obtained by BuzzFeed and the Washington Post through a Freedom of Information Act request and made public in separate reports published on June 1.
 
Hydroxychloroquine is specifically mentioned nearly three-dozen times, usually in the form of someone asking the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director for his thoughts on the drug, which is typically used to treat lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and malaria.

 
The earliest mention was from an exchange Fauci had on Feb. 24, 2020, with a pharmacologist at the federal Food and Drug Administration asking him if there was any proof to back up a claim from China on hydroxychloroquine being able to ""decrease COVID-19 infections and lung disease.""
 
""There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim. There are a lot of these types of claims going around. I would love to see their data,"" Fauci responded.
 
The next mention of hydroxychloroquine in the email dump occurred April 11, 2020, when Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., asked whether there were any cases of lupus patients contracting COVID-19.
 
""The answer is almost certainly yes, but there would not be enough of them whereby we can compare the results in those who were receiving hydroxychloroquine or not for their lupus,"" Fauci responded. ""Large natural history studies, which we will be initiating, could possibly answer that question.""
 
In other emails asking about the drug, Fauci did acknowledge there were anecdotal accounts about hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness but said he was waiting on results from a then-ongoing clinical trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health looking into whether the drug could be used as a treatment for COVID-19.
 
""We will know soon whether hydroxychloroquine has any beneficial effects as the results of randomized, controlled trials become available,"" he said in one email sent May 1, 2020.
 
At no point in any of the emails sent by Fauci did he say himself that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment. However, around the time of the emails, then-President Donald Trump was touting its alleged benefits.
 
Fauci’s emails echo past statements he’s made publicly about the drug, acknowledging the anecdotal evidence but withholding any official position until a clinical trial is completed.
 
The study conducted by the NIH was eventually halted in June 2020 after it found hydroxychloroquine was ""very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19.""
 
""The data from this study indicate that this drug provided no additional benefit compared to placebo control for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,"" according to a statement from the NIH.
 
At the same time, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization it had issued for the drug  three months prior. In addition to the NIH study finding no benefit to taking hydroxychloroquine, the FDA said taking the drug could potentially lead to serious side effects including ""serious cardiac adverse events"" and that any potential benefits ""no longer outweigh the known and potential risks.""
 
Misinformation attempting to connect Fauci and his knowledge about hydroxychloroquine is not new. PolitiFact previously debunked a claim in 2020 alleging he knew as early as 2005 the drug was capable of treating coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19 and actively advocated against its use.
 
The Facebook post also claims Fauci knew face masks did not work to stop the virus, which we rated False.  
 
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims Fauci knew about hydroxychloroquine's ability to treat people with COVID-19, referencing emails from the health director obtained by BuzzFeed and the Washington Post. 
However, those emails do not show him acknowledging its effectiveness. Instead, it shows him aware of claims being made by other people about the drug and that he’s waiting on the results of a study being conducted on hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for COVID-19.
The study was eventually halted after researchers concluded the drug offered no additional benefit for treating the virus.

Tweets","Social media posts wrongly claim vaccination can happen only during lockdowns




If Your Time is short





In the U.S. and the U.K., emergency approvals were granted to vaccine manufacturers separate from any decisions to impose coronavirus restrictions.


Lifting such “lockdowns” doesn’t mean vaccines can no longer be administered, experts from both countries said. In the U.S., there was never a full nationwide lockdown.


The author of the original tweet about vaccines and lockdowns told us: “To be clear, I have no idea if this is correct or not.”





See the sources for this fact-check




The U.S. and the U.K. approved the first COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use months ago, clearing the way for the millions of people to be inoculated.
Now, social media users are falling for posts that claim, wrongly, that the vaccines’ emergency approvals are a sign that government-imposed ""lockdown"" measures are here to say.
""The vaccine is authorised for emergency use only and still in live clinical trials until 2023,"" says a March 25 tweet from a British poster. ""They’re unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends because the emergency ends with it. Hence why, lockdowns won’t end anytime soon.""

A screenshot of the March 25 tweet about vaccines and lockdowns.
That’s not true, public health experts said. In both the U.S. and the U.K., the authorizations for the vaccine are not tied to stay-at-home orders and other restrictions to limit the virus’ spread. 
But the tweet spread widely online, with screenshots of it posted on Facebook and Instagram receiving thousands of interactions, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. 
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Social media users left comments on Facebook and Instagram indicating that they thought the claim was about the U.S., but the person who authored the original tweet told PolitiFact he was posting from the U.K. So, PolitiFact spoke to experts and government regulatory agencies from both countries.

A screenshot of an Instagram post sharing the March 25 tweet about vaccines and lockdowns.
We found that no matter which side of the Atlantic Ocean you’re on, it’s inaccurate to say that ""they’re unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends."" 
Asked for evidence to support the claim, the person behind the tweet did not provide any. He later said in a direct message on Twitter: ""To be clear, I have no idea if this is correct or not.""
The state of the pandemic
One problem with the tweet is the claim that ""lockdowns won’t end anytime soon.""
The U.K. is starting to ease the restrictions imposed by law in January to limit gatherings and minimize the virus’ spread — restrictions that news outlets have referred to as a lockdown.
But in the U.S., there is no nationwide lockdown and never was. Masks are currently required in about half the states, but businesses across the country are mostly open, and no state is enforcing a mandatory curfew or stay-at-home order, according to the New York Times.  
""The U.S. government hasn’t locked anything down,"" said John Grabenstein, associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition.
Ending lockdowns doesn’t mean losing the ability to vaccinate
The main problem with the tweet, however, is the inaccurate claim that lifting restrictions would mean losing the ability to continue vaccinating the population against COVID-19. There is no connection between lockdowns and vaccine administration — in either country.
In both the U.K. and the U.S., regulators granted emergency use authorization to manufacturers such as Pfizer after their COVID-19 vaccines were proven in trials to be safe and effective. The manufacturers will continue monitoring participants in their final clinical trials, as the tweet says.

""Each of the companies wants to get full licensing,"" Grabenstein said, adding that they are ""well on their way"" toward doing so. ""The government wants them to earn their license.""
However, the emergency use authorizations that greenlighted the vaccines don’t make the U.S. and U.K. ""unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends,"" experts agreed.
Emergency use authorizations in the U.S.
In the U.S., stay-at-home orders and other restrictions are handed down at the state and local levels, while the emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a federal agency.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration building in Silver Spring, Md., on Dec. 10, 2020. (AP)
The emergency approval has ""nothing"" to do with lockdowns, said Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California, Irvine.
Instead, emergency use authorizations are temporary licenses granted while manufacturers collect more data and apply for full licenses, Noymer said. The FDA can grant them if the health and human services secretary has declared that a public health emergency justifies it.
Alex Azar, the secretary under the Trump administration, made such a declaration Feb. 4, 2020.
In a statement to PolitiFact, the FDA said that unless they are revoked, the emergency use authorizations will remain in effect until the public health emergency declaration is lifted. 
""The vaccines can be used under an emergency use authorization as long as there is a declared emergency,"" said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins University. ""But a declared emergency does not require that there be ‘lockdowns.’ There can still be a declared emergency and vaccination without ‘lockdowns.’""
In 2009, for example, the FDA granted several emergency use authorizations related to the swine flu, but the country never locked down.
Emergency use authorizations in the U.K.
In the U.K., regulators at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency granted emergency approval to vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford University. 
Such temporary licenses are allowed under British law during a public health emergency and while the full licensing process runs its course. In 2020, the law was amended to make them ""as similar to a usual marketing authorization as possible,"" an MHRA spokesperson said.
The COVID-19 restrictions constituting a lockdown, however, were voted on by Parliament. As in the U.S., lockdowns have no bearing on those emergency approvals, experts said.
""I am 99.9999% certain that emergency use does not equal a period of lockdown, said John Edmunds, professor of epidemiology and population health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, adding that the concept of emergency use has been around for years.
It wouldn’t make sense for any government to ""bind its hands"" by tying lockdowns to the ability to continue administering vaccines, Grabenstein added.
The MHRA’s conditions for authorizing the COVID-19 vaccines say the approvals ""will be valid until expressly withdrawn by MHRA or upon issue of a full market authorisation by the MHRA."" 
Given that language and other language on the MHRA’s website, the duration of the temporary license appears to be within the MHRA’s discretion, said Christopher Newdick, a professor of medical law and contract law at the University of Reading. 
""It is not tied to the duration of the emergency lockdown described by the COVID regulations,"" Newdick said. ""So the licensing status of the vaccines is subject to a different range of considerations to do with safety and efficacy and a different timescale.""
Our ruling
Social media posts said ""they’re unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends because the emergency ends with it.""
That’s inaccurate in both the U.S. and the U.K., where emergency approvals were granted to vaccine manufacturers separate from any decisions to impose restrictions meant to thwart the virus. The person behind the original tweet admitted: ""I have no idea if this is correct or not.""

False claims about the Gates Foundation’s connection to the novel coronavirus know no borders.
In a May 6 Facebook post, an alternative-health page and website called Revive Yourself claimed the philanthropic foundation of billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates stands to profit from the development of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom.
""At £477 per vaccine, multiplied by 65 million people in the UK, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are on course to make just under £31,500,000,000 from Great Britain alone. Let that sink in,"" the page wrote. ""And people still ask who benefits from this virus & lock down?""
That’s $38.4 billion in American dollars, by the way. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The image in the post is a screenshot of a May 6 tweet from Ryan Martin, who runs Revive Yourself. The website publishes misleading claims about vaccines alongside recommendations for essential oils and supplements. 

(Screenshot from Facebook)
We’ve fact-checked several false and misleading claims about the Gates Foundation’s connection to the coronavirus pandemic — Martin even included one of the false claims in his Facebook post. So we wanted to take a closer look at the post, which he also published on his site.
The Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential novel coronavirus vaccines. There is no evidence that the Gates Foundation stands to profit from these efforts. The false claim has been widely shared in conspiratorial groups on Facebook.
False claim comes from conspiracy site
The assertion that the Gates Foundation stands to make money from a potential coronavirus vaccine originated on a website with a track record of publishing misinformation.
We reached out to Martin for evidence to back up his Facebook post and blog entry. He sent us a YouTube video from Zed Phoenix, who describes himself as an ""investigative journalist, author and broadcaster.""
In the video, which has more than 75,000 views, Phoenix makes the same claim about the Gates Foundation making money off a coronavirus vaccine. As evidence, Phoenix points to an article on BeforeItsNews.com, a website that has published false stories in the past. The story has been shared hundreds of times in Facebook groups for believers in conspiracies like QAnon, a broad right-wing conspiracy.
The article claims without evidence that Gates ""reaps profits through Microsoft and his other companies"" from his philanthropic giving. The story makes several other false or misleading claims about the Gates Foundation, vaccines and the coronavirus pandemic — as does Martin’s Facebook post.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







""The Facebook post contains a number of false claims about the Gates Foundation,"" the charity told us in an email. ""The foundation is not involved in the sale of vaccines in the United Kingdom, or anywhere else.""
Source of the financial estimate
The basis for the £31.5 billion figure in the Facebook post comes from a March 17 Daily Mail story.
The article includes an estimated cost of £477 per injection of a coronavirus vaccine that’s being developed by Moderna Inc., a U.S. biotechnology company. The newspaper attributes the estimate simply to ""analysts."" 
The Before It’s News story got the £31.5 billion figure by multiplying £477 times the population of the U.K., which was estimated to be around 66.4 million in June 2019.
We could not find the cost estimate reported in other publications, or on Moderna’s website. So we reached out to the company for more information about the estimated cost of its vaccine, which entered a clinical trial in mid-March.
We haven’t heard back, but the company told Business Insider in March that it would not ""price this higher than other respiratory-virus vaccines."" Other pharmaceutical companies have offered similar statements.
The Gates Foundation’s commitment
The Gates Foundation said in a Feb. 5 statement that it is investing up to $100 million for ""the global response to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" That includes up to $60 million to ""accelerate the discovery, development and testing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for 2019-nCoV,""  the scientific name for the novel coronavirus.
There are 108 potential vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization — at last eight of which are in clinical trials. The Gates Foundation is funding some of those efforts, but that doesn’t mean the philanthropy would share in future profits from a successful vaccine.
RELATED: How close is a coronavirus vaccine?
The Gates Foundation is a private nonprofit foundation that gets most of its money from contributions, specifically from the Gateses themselves through their family trust, according to the charity’s tax return. The trust’s most recent holdings report shows that it does not currently own stock in any of the companies that are working on coronavirus vaccines. Additionally, the Gates Foundation does not hold any patents related to the novel coronavirus.
Our ruling
A Facebook post and several blog articles claim that the Gates Foundation could make more than £30 billion from a coronavirus vaccine.
That number is based on multiplying a reported estimate of the cost of a potential COVID-19 vaccine times the population of the U.K. But the company developing the vaccine has not publicly released an estimate. And while the Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential coronavirus vaccines, there is no evidence that it stands to profit from them.

The notion that we are “rounding the corner” would imply significant and sustained reductions in the spread of the virus. In reality, that hasn’t been happening.

 
Cases have been rising steadily since mid-September, hospitalizations have been rising for almost two weeks, and positivity rates have been rising since the end of September.

In the final presidential debate of 2020, President Donald Trump repeated a characterization of the coronavirus pandemic that he had used previously, including at a town hall one week earlier.
""We are rounding the turn,"" on coronavirus, Trump said in the Oct. 22 debate in Nashville. ""We are rounding the corner.""
No one knows the future course of the coronavirus pandemic. But ""rounding the corner"" suggests that significant and sustained improvements are being made in the fight against the virus, and that’s not the case in the U.S., according to the data.
The number of coronavirus cases is climbing once again, after falling consistently between late July and mid-September. Cases are now at their highest point since early August, with almost 60,000 new confirmed infections a day, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. That’s only about 10% lower than the peak in late July.

 
Epidemiologists are worried that the change in seasons could only make matters worse, as colder weather drives more people indoors, where the virus can spread more efficiently.
""The winter is going to be long and hard,"" Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at Boston University told PolitiFact. ""I do worry about the path of the current metrics.""
Hospitalizations today are lower than in previous spikes, but in the past few weeks, there has been a modest spike in hospitalizations.

 
And the positivity rate, which measures what percentage of tests come up positive for the virus, also went up again during the past few weeks. This is a concern because higher positivity rates are an indicator of community spread.

The one encouraging change is that the number of deaths has eased somewhat. Since a peak in August, deaths have fallen fairly consistently due to a combination of factors, including improved understanding of how to treat the disease.

 
That said, deaths have settled in at about 800 a day, which is a substantial level and is keeping total deaths per week in the United States above normal levels.

 
""Our experience over the last several months has made us better at managing disease among infected people,"" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor of public health at Claremont Graduate University.

Our ruling

No one can predict the future course of the pandemic, but the notion that we are ""rounding the corner"" would imply significant and sustained reductions in the spread of the virus. In reality, that hasn’t been happening.
Cases have been rising steadily since mid-September, hospitalizations have been rising for almost two weeks, and positivity rates have been rising since the end of September.

Facebook posts","No proof for researcher claim that COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein is a ‘toxin’




If Your Time is short





Experts say there is no evidence that the vaccines produce a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage, as Canadian viral immunologist Byram Bridle maintained.


Bridle has not produced evidence to prove his claim, which has been widely shared on social media.





See the sources for this fact-check




A university expert claimed on talk radio that he has new evidence that COVID-19 vaccines produce a ""toxin.""
The credentials of Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, include research funding from the Canadian government and the Canadian Cancer Society, as well as dozens of publications in research journals.
But experts told PolitiFact that, despite a document Bridle cites, there is no evidence to back his claim that what is known as the vaccines’ spike protein produces a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage.
""There is no data that the spike is a toxin,"" said Dr. Drew Weissman, a vaccine expert and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The document he cites is an anti-vaxxer product with no real scientific data supporting its claims.""
Bridle’s interview sparks social media burst
Bridle began a Canadian talk show interview with a dramatic warning: ""I’ll forewarn you and your listeners that the story I’m about to tell is a bit of a scary one."" 
Describing himself as ""very much pro-vaccine,"" Bridle said he had assembled scientific information that he intends to make public, but ""your listeners are going to be the first to hear the public release of this conclusion."" 
He claimed the information shows that the spike protein produced by the vaccines, which is intended to prevent the coronavirus from infecting the body, does not remain in the shoulder muscle but gets into the blood — and can lead to clotting, bleeding, heart problems and neurological damage.  
""In short, the conclusion is, we made a big mistake,"" Bridle said. ""We didn’t realize it until now. We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen. We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin, and was a pathogenic protein. So, by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin. Some people, this gets into circulation, and when that happens in some people, they can cause damage, especially in the cardiovascular system. And I have many other legitimate questions about the long-term safety, therefore, of this vaccine.""
The interview led to claims widely shared on websites and social media, including posts that linked to an article from the website of the Hal Turner Radio Show, which uses internet and radio broadcasts to float conspiracy theories and hate speech. The article carried this headline:
""Doctor on COVID Vax: ‘We Screwed-Up. We didn't realize the Spike Protein is a TOXIN’ Does this mean everyone vaccinated is manufacturing their own Spike Protein Toxins in their own bodies?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Explaining ""spike proteins""
COVID-19 mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines use the human body’s natural immune response to its advantage. The shot contains the recipe for making the molecule known as the spike protein, which the COVID-19 virus uses to bind to cells. Once the cell receives these instructions, it creates the protein and displays it on its surface. The immune system then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to fight it.
The technology in the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna stems from research that began in the early 1990s, said Weissman. He and his colleague Katalin Karikó, a senior vice president of BioNTech, are credited with the breakthrough discovery that enabled these vaccines to be safe and highly effective.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which calls the spike protein harmless, says: ""Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection.""
Bridle’s evidence seen lacking
PolitiFact emailed Bridle on June 3 asking for the evidence to back his statement, and received an automated reply from him. The reply said that the radio interview led to ""vicious attacks,"" including a website that emerged May 28 bearing his name. Bridle’s email said that he believes the website — which anonymously critiques Bridle’s claims — to be libeling him.
Also in the email, Bridle cited a document that he said supports what he said in the interview, and that he would be writing a more comprehensive public report.
The document claims that ""recent studies suggest that the spike protein produced in response to vaccination"" could result ""in damage to various tissues and organs. This risk, no matter how theoretical, must be investigated prior to the vaccination of children and adolescents."" 
On that point, the document links to one Journal of Respiration article published Dec. 31, days after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The article describes how the spike protein in the coronavirus affects lung cells and says that because the spike protein will be administered in vaccines, ""it is critical to understand the biological effects of this protein on human cells to ensure that it does not promote long-term adverse health consequences.""
Weissman said Bridle’s conclusion that the vaccines are toxic is off-base, especially given that the vaccines do not deliver spike protein to the lungs.
""Reports of spike protein trouble are interesting and important for coronavirus infection, but they do not mean that the vaccines themselves are going to cause similar problems,"" said a May 4 commentary in Science Translational Medicine, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
The commentary notes that ""the spike protein is not released to wander freely through the bloodstream,"" and says the fact that the vaccines ""are aimed at the spike means that they’re protective in more ways than we even realized.""
Despite the widespread administration of the vaccine, Dr. Walter Orenstein, professor and associate director of Emory University’s Emory Vaccine Center, said he is ""not aware of any data to support the allegations"" made by Bridle. 
""It would be nice to have any direct evidence if this were true,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 
""We are at nearly 300 million doses given (in the United States) and a robust surveillance system in a population that is certainly not shy about reporting problems"" about vaccines to public health authorities, Offit said.
Our ruling
A post widely shared on social media claims a viral immunologist said COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein means people are being inoculated ""with a toxin.""
Experts say there is no evidence that the spike protein produced by the vaccines is a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage. The Canadian viral immunologist who made the claim has not produced evidence to back it up.

Hundreds of beach-goers in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., hit the sand after the mayor decided to ease some social distancing policies. But a conspiracy theory on Facebook calls foul on the media for using what appears to be the same photo to report on beaches of the east and west coasts. 
One post published April 19 shows two screenshots of news stories that appear to have the same lead image. The photo shows a beach crowded with people, not all of whom are staying six feet apart.
But one headline is about Los Angeles County and the other is about Jacksonville Beach.
""How did all these SAME EXACT PEOPLE go to two different beaches and walk exactly the same?!"" reads the caption on the post. ""Media!!!""

The original article about Los Angeles was published by NBC News on April 18 as part of the outlet’s coronavirus live blog. The headline is not fully visible in the side-by-side, but on the NBC News website it reads: ""Los Angeles County records highest daily death toll.""
The photo is real — but it was taken in Jacksonville, not Los Angeles. And we could find no evidence that any news outlets have used the image in coverage about the coronavirus in California.
A Getty Images photographer took the photo in Jacksonville Beach on April 17 — the same day that Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry reopened Duval County beaches for restricted hours. The New York Post published that photo in its story about Florida, but it doesn’t appear anywhere in the NBC News story about Los Angeles. 
The Jacksonville Beach photo does not appear in News Break’s version of the NBC News story either. Its site shows an image of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. 
The image of Murphy appears to come from an April 18 press conference, which NBC News covered further down in its live blog. Sometimes when a link to a news story is shared on Facebook, the platform erroneously uses another image from that webpage as the share image.
We tried sharing News Break’s version of the NBC News story. Facebook automatically pulled in the image of Murphy.

We could not find the Getty Images photo included in any news stories about Los Angeles County. 
News aggregation apps like News Break have seen an increase in downloads amid the coronavirus pandemic. It’s possible the same glitch that erroneously attached a photo of Murphy to NBC News’ story about Los Angeles also attached the Jacksonville Beach photo at some point.

Facebook posts","Facebook post wrong about wearing mask, carrying concealed weapon in North Carolina




If Your Time is short




A viral Facebook post said ""you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying.”
A North Carolina law does prohibit people from covering their faces in public.
But that law is currently suspended. And, even if it weren't suspended, experts say it wouldn't affect concealed carry laws.




See the sources for this fact-check




In North Carolina, some residents are speculating about the ripple effects of Gov. Roy Cooper’s mandate that people wear masks in public.
One Facebook post, which was viewed hundreds of times, said the mandate will infringe upon North Carolinians’ Second Amendment rights.
""For those of you like myself that has your concealed carry permit and carry, you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying,"" it says, adding: ""Once you have a felony(,) you can no longer carry.""
Is that true?
No. A spokesman for Cooper, who is a Democrat, a spokesman for the Republican state Senate leader, and the leader of the state’s leading gun rights group all agree: North Carolinians are allowed to wear a mask and carry a concealed weapon.

Mask laws
The Facebook post references North Carolina’s General Statute 14-12.
That statute, specifically 14-12.7, forbids adults from concealing their identities in public. But it doesn’t mention guns at all. And it passed decades ago to target the Ku Klux Klan, according to WRAL.
The mask law was suspended in May when state lawmakers passed their coronavirus relief package. 
The law now says ""any person wearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others"" is exempt from state law prohibiting masks in public. It’s set to expire Aug. 1.
But even when it does expire, experts told us they don’t believe there will be a conflict between mask laws and concealed carry laws.

What experts said
Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact that the anti-mask law applies ""irrespective of whether a person is carrying a weapon or not.""
""No statute exists that treats carrying a concealed weapon while masked differently than any other activity while masked,"" Ryan said.
Grass Roots North Carolina, one of the state’s leading advocates for Second Amendment rights, interprets the mask laws the same way. Paul Valone, president of Grass Roots NC, told PolitiFact in a phone interview that he’s aware of the rumors. 
He says they’re inaccurate and could potentially discourage someone from carrying their concealed weapon and protecting themselves. Valone posted a letter from the group’s lawyer on its Facebook page.
""At your request, I have investigate(d) the rampant rumors that NC law makes it a felony to carry a firearm while wearing a mask – even if the individual holds a valid Concealed Handgun Permit,"" wrote Ed Green, the group’s Director of Legal Affairs. ""There is no such law.""
Green explained the mask and concealed carry laws this way:
""There is no law that makes wearing a mask illegal because one is carrying a firearm, and there is no law that makes carrying a firearm illegal because one is wearing a mask.""
Asked if it’s illegal to carry a concealed weapon while wearing a mask, Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said: ""Having reviewed the concealed carry statute, our office does not believe this is the case.""

Simone Gold","Receiving COVID-19 vaccine does not enroll you in a government tracking system or medical experiment




If Your Time is short



• The “tracking system” is actually a government database used to keep track of vaccine supplies and distribution, not the people who receive vaccines. Enrollment in a separate part of the system that allows vaccinated people to report side effects to the CDC is voluntary. 
• Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine does not automatically enroll a patient in a medical trial. Clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccines were done before they were approved. ​



See the sources for this fact-check




A viral video shows a doctor accusing the U.S. government of testing out COVID-19 vaccines on the general population and involuntarily entering recipients into a tracking system. 
""If you take the vaccine, you'll be enrolled in a pharmacovigilance tracking system. It means that you've enrolled yourself in a medical trial,"" the doctor says. ""This pharmacovigilance tracking system tracks you for two years. It’s set up by the Department of Defense. It was handed off to Oracle and Google to put the data together.""
The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The doctor is Simone Gold, a founder of America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that became famous for voicing coronavirus conspiracy theories. Gold herself has spread misinformation in the past, and she was recently charged for participating in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
According to the Medical Board of California, Gold holds an active medical license. She specializes in emergency medicine and general practice. However, many of her assertions about the COVID-19 vaccines are misleading or downright wrong. 
There is no evidence that receiving the COVID-19 vaccine enrolls people in a government tracking program, as Gold suggests, and clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccines were done before they were approved for emergency use. 
We reached out to Gold for comment but didn’t hear back. 
Getting the vaccine won’t enroll you in a government tracking program
Clinics do report vaccinations to state databases to help with distribution and allow healthcare providers to keep track of immunizations. However, Gold’s claim that getting vaccinated automatically enrolls people into a government tracking system is misleading. 
State vaccine registries allow public health and healthcare providers to confirm that the vaccines are being properly distributed. Since both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses to be maximally effective, the databases also help providers ensure that vaccinated people receive their recommended second dose on schedule. 
This data wouldn’t be used to allow the government to track people, said Kelly Moore, deputy director of the Immunization Action Coalition.

""These systems are not typically used for post-authorization safety surveillance,"" said Moore. ""Any use of data from these systems outside the purpose of direct patient care would be done with de-identified data (no personal information) and would be subject to research review and approval processes.""
The ""tracking system"" that Gold references explicitly is an online system run by Oracle that is being used to help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keep track of vaccine logistics and distribution. According to Oracle, anonymized data from the system will be used for ""analysis and reporting by authorized agencies and organizations."" 
Another part of the CDC system is ""v-safe,"" a smartphone-based vaccine safety program that allows vaccine recipients to report any adverse side effects to the CDC. 
Moore confirmed that enrollment in the v-safe program is voluntary, not mandatory as Gold claims. The CDC and Oracle have also confirmed to other fact-checkers that participation in the program is optional. 
In addition, signing up to receive a COVID-19 vaccine does not automatically enroll a patient in an experimental medical trial. Vaccine trials are used to test the safety and efficacy of vaccines before they are rolled out to the public. The COVID-19 vaccines have already been subject to these studies, which involved tens of thousands of volunteers. 
To receive emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna had to follow up with at least half of the participants for at least two months after they received their vaccinations to check for any negative effects.

Facebook posts","No, it’s not safer to skip the COVID-19 vaccine to avoid permanent side effects




If Your Time is short





Getting vaccinated reduced the likelihood of COVID-19 infection by as much as 95% in clinical trials.


If you get vaccinated and still get COVID-19, vaccines make it less likely that you’ll get seriously ill.


There is no evidence of permanent side effects.





See the sources for this fact-check




One argument for not getting a coronavirus vaccination goes like this:
Even if you get vaccinated, it’s possible to get COVID-19; the vaccines can have ""permanent"" side effects; so, it’s safer not to get vaccinated. 
The argument is made in a post widely shared on Instagram that says:
""If I don’t take the vaccine, I’m at risk for covid. If I do take the vaccine, I’m still at risk for covid PLUS I’m at risk for permanent vaccine side effects. Therefore I’m reducing my risk by not taking the vaccine. That’s the real science."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
What the science shows is vaccines dramatically reduce the chances of getting COVID-19. And if you do contract COVID-19 even after a vaccine, you’re less likely to get seriously sick, thanks to the work of the vaccine.

As for permanent side effects, this is an area still being studied. But as one virologist put it, the risk ""is extremely low to the point of being almost impossible to measure.""
Vaccine: High levels of protection
The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to three coronavirus vaccines: one from Pfizer-BioNTech, one from Moderna, and one from Johnson & Johnson. They were authorized following clinical trials that lasted months and included tens of thousands of participants. The FDA found ""no specific safety concerns"" associated with any of the three vaccines. 
According to the private Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minn., the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms; the rate for Moderna is 94% and for Johnson & Johnson, 66%, based on clinical trials.
A federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published March 29 found that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines reduce risk of infection by 90% after the full course of two shots and by 80% two weeks after the first shot. The study was done under ""real-world conditions"": 3,950 health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers were tested for 13 consecutive weeks.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







A study published Feb. 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine provided nearly 90% protection. That study, in Israel, compared 596,618 unvaccinated people with 596,618 people who were vaccinated.
Some people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get infected — but based on clinical studies, the vaccine can keep them from getting seriously ill, according to the CDC.
Vaccinations are widely recommended because, even though many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness, have long-term health effects or die — and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you don’t have an increased risk of developing severe complications, the CDC says.
No evidence of ‘permanent side effects’
Because clinical trials started in the summer of 2020, it’s not yet clear if the COVID-19 vaccines could result in some long-term side effects, but vaccines rarely cause long-term side effects, the Mayo Clinic says.
Although data on side effects ""is still emerging, and the CDC is tracking this in the U.S., the risk of permanent side effects is extremely low to the point of being almost impossible to measure,"" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""There is no significant risk of permanent injury with any of the vaccines available in the U.S.""
Most cases of severe, systemic adverse events from any of the COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the U.S are anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction that occurs in about 1 in 1 million cases, Rasmussen said. It does not cause long-term permanent injury if treated promptly, she said.
""There really have been little to no reports of permanent side effects, conclusively attributed to the vaccines, to date,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.
More than 145 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through March 29. Among them, 2,509 deaths were reported (0.0017%). According to the CDC, reviews by physicians from the CDC and the FDA ""revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.""

Science shows that the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. reduce the likelihood of infection by 66% to 95% — and make it less likely that you’ll get seriously ill if you do contract COVID-19 after being vaccinated. There is no evidence the vaccines cause permanent side effects.

Instagram posts","A ‘face mask exempt card’ doesn’t exempt you from wearing a mask in public




If Your Time is short





The Justice Department has debunked the claim. The Freedom to Breathe Agency isn’t a real federal agency. 


The Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, does not specifically say anything about face masks. 


While it’s true that businesses are not allowed to ask customers about their disabilities, and there may be some exceptions to the law, governments have broad authority to issue health mandates during a pandemic.





See the sources for this fact-check




As more cities impose mandatory mask-wearing rules, some Americans are looking for loopholes. Enter the so-called ""face mask exempt card."" 
A June 23 Instagram post shows a photo of a laminated card that says it exempts the owner from ""any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public."" The image bears the seal of the U.S. Justice Department and includes a logo for another entity called the FTBA.
""Wearing a face mask posses a mental and/or physical risk to me,"" reads text on the card, spelling error included. ""Under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you.""
Below the text, there’s the ADA phone number for reporting violations, followed by potential fines for offending businesses and organizations. 
""Denying access to your business/organization will be also reported to FTBA for further actions,"" reads the card, which includes a link to ftbagency.com.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) 
Similar posts started circulating on conservative Facebook pages in late April and early May. The first instance of the ""face mask exempt card"" we could find was posted in several pro-Donald Trump and Fox News fan groups on June 20, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool.

(Screenshot from Instagram)
The advisory is not real. The FTBA — which stands for the Freedom to Breathe Agency — is not a part of the U.S. government.
""These postings were not issued by the Department and are not endorsed by the Department,"" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement published on the ADA website. ""The Department urges the public not to rely on the information contained in these postings.""
The FTBA website was registered June 12, according to public domain records, and it now appears to be down. FTBA’s Facebook group, which had more than 5,000 members and was created in early June, also appears to be offline.
While the card is phony, we wondered whether there is a point about citing an ADA exemption for face masks to evade some state and local mask requirements.
The ADA only provides legal protections to Americans who genuinely have disabilities. Legal experts say it’s possible that there could be some situations in which businesses may have to adjust their practices to accommodate people who cannot wear a mask and comply with the law. It’s also possible that some people could abuse the ADA to try to get around mask requirements.
""People that are not disabled are not protected by the ADA,"" said Vinh Nguyen, project director at the Southwest ADA Center. ""I realize that does not prevent people from lying.""
What the ADA has to do with mask requirements
Governments have broad authority to issue health mandates in a pandemic. From New York to California, dozens of states across the country have implemented requirements for people to wear face masks in certain public spaces. The legal framework for mask requirements varies across the country.

""Think of it like this: The government has the right to ban smoking in public places because your smoking can affect my health,"" wrote Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute in a June 22 column. (Poynter owns PolitiFact.) ""And some places have signs that say, ‘No shirt, no shoes, no service.’ Just add ‘no mask’ to the sign.""
The Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, does not specifically say anything about face masks. However, there may be situations in which, by requiring people to wear face masks in public, businesses would need to consider aspects of the ADA.
 
For example, let’s say you’re deaf and primarily rely on lip-reading to communicate. You go to pick up takeout from a restaurant that requires everyone to wear face masks, including employees. Since you can’t read the employees’ lips, that business must provide ""auxiliary aids and services"" so they don’t deny you service, according to the ADA. Perhaps the cashier could communicate with you via text message or a dry-erase board to complete your order.
""What the ADA basically mandates is that they have to consider serving the customer in another way,"" Nguyen said. ""They don’t have to allow entry into the actual store.""
There also may be a case in which a customer has a respiratory condition where their breathing cannot be restricted. Similar to the previous example, a business would not have to alter its mask policy to comply with the ADA; it could provide curbside pickup or delivery.
It’s true that, per the ADA, businesses are not allowed to ask customers specific questions about their disabilities. 
""They cannot ask for medical documentation,"" said Robin Jones, director of the Great Lakes ADA Center. ""They can ask if you’re not wearing a mask due to a disability, but they cannot ask me what my disability is.""
That creates a situation in which people could potentially abuse the law to try to get around mask requirements.
""We know that people abuse these things — just like people take their dogs into places and claim they’re a service animal,"" Jones said. ""This is just unfortunately the nature of human nature. There is no good way for an entity to monitor that.""
RELATED: Yes, Gov. Newsom has the authority to make masks mandatory In California, legal experts say
The ADA permits retailers to deny goods or services to customers if they pose a ""direct threat"" to the health and safety of others — but only when the threat cannot be mitigated by changing their practices or procedures. That stipulation may apply if someone without a mask exhibits COVID-19 symptoms in a business that requires face coverings.
""In this type of scenario, where there’s a chance where an unmasked person may transmit the virus to their employees or to their other customers, they have a right to restrict people from coming into the store,"" Nguyen said.
Our ruling
An Instagram post claimed that a ""face mask exempt card"" allows you to cite the ADA and not wear a mask.
The advisory is not real. The FTBA is not a part of the U.S. government, and the ADA only provides legal protections to Americans who genuinely have disabilities. Legal experts say it’s possible that there could be some situations in which businesses may have to alter their operations to comply with the law. It’s also possible that some people could abuse the ADA to try to get around mask requirements.

Facebook posts","Masks for COVID-19 are effective, as a six-part Facebook takedown fails




If Your Time is short





Studies show masks can curb spread of the novel coronavirus. 


Experts say the face coverings do not cause health problems.





See the sources for this fact-check




A Facebook user declared, ""I’m starting a public movement called TAKE IT OFF,"" in attempting a six-point takedown of facial coverings and how effective they are in fighting COVID-19.
The post features an image labeled ""Face Mask Safety — Know The Facts Before You Wear One."" The image makes this six-part claim about masks:
""Decreases oxygen intake; increases toxin inhalation; shuts down immune system; increases virus risk; scientifically inaccurate; effectiveness not studied."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""Well, that all sounds like a lot of dangerous nonsense,"" Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman told PolitiFact.
Generally recommended
As we’ve reported, facial coverings are not in themselves totally effective in fighting the coronavirus and there is a need for more study. But health officials largely agree that wearing any kind of face mask, coupled with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, is more protective than going unmasked. 
While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend masks for children under age 2 or for people who are unconscious or have breathing conditions, it generally recommends wearing masks in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. As the CDC puts it: ""Your cloth face covering may protect them. Their cloth face covering may protect you.""
Here’s a rundown on why each part of the post is wrong.
1. ""Decreases oxygen intake.""
""Breathing through a mask decreases the amount of oxygen we need to live & be healthy, increases blood acidity & makes breathing difficult.""
A mask does not reduce oxygen intake nor does it make blood more acidic, virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, told PolitiFact.
Neuman said a mask ""will add some resistance to the breathing process, meaning it may feel like it takes a bit more work to take a breath, but it won't materially change the makeup of air that comes through the mask."" 
2. ""Increases toxin inhalation.""
""Toxins that we normally exhale as we breathe become trapped in the mask and re-inhaled into the lungs, increasing symptoms."" 
Repeated, long-term usage of the same unwashed mask could potentially lead to bacteria accumulating on the inside, which is why paper masks shouldn’t be reused and cloth masks should be laundered with soap between uses, Rasmussen said. ""However, there’s no reason to worry about ‘toxins,’’ she said. ""The only potentially toxic molecule that you routinely exhale is carbon dioxide, which is only toxic when it displaces oxygen,"" and it easily passes through the mask. 
Neuman also said carbon dioxide would not be trapped by a mask.
3. ""Shuts down immune system.""
""Decreases oxygen intake, increases carbon dioxide & toxin intake putting body under stress, releasing cortisol & shutting down immune processes.""
Not true.

""There’s no decreased oxygen or increased carbon dioxide from normal breathing while wearing a mask, and no evidence that masks have any effect on the immune system or immune function,"" Rasmussen said.
Inhaling high levels of carbon dioxide is dangerous, but this is very unlikely to happen from wearing a cloth face mask — especially if you’re only wearing it for short periods of time, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
 
There are studies that show that medical N95 respirators may result in increased carbon dioxide, which can lead to headaches and fatigue. This is one reason they're not recommended for home use,"" University of San Francisco research scientist Jeremy Howard told PolitiFact. ""Cloth masks, on the other hand, have excellent breathability and the same problems have not been demonstrated with them.""
A USA Today fact-check said a similar claim, that masks weaken the immune system, was false.
4. ""Increases virus risk.""
""Encourages triggering & infection from dormant retro viruses already in the body, taking advantage of a weakened immune system due to mask wearing.""
Masks can be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 because COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, according to the CDC. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. 
""It’s absurd to think that masks would ‘trigger’ their activation and cause disease, especially since mask-wearing has no effect on immune system function,"" Rasmussen said.
5. ""Scientifically inaccurate.""
""Virologists measure COVID-19 to be 80-140nm in size making the weave of material masks to be the equivalent of a chain-link fence to a mosquito.""
(NM is a reference to the nanometer measure of diameter.)
Rasmussen said virus particles are much smaller than the weave of masks, but infected people do not shed individual virus particles into the environment — they shed them in respiratory droplets. Masks prevent most, but not all, of these respiratory droplets from being dispersed into the environment.
""In addition, although we don’t know how many virus particles it takes to cause an infection, it’s almost certainly more than one. So you have to be exposed to enough respiratory droplets containing enough virus to establish an infection to actually become infected. Reducing droplet dispersal by wearing a mask greatly reduces this exposure risk, though it does not eliminate it completely,"" she said.
Neuman said there is a growing number of research papers that demonstrate the effectiveness of surgical face masks in preventing transmission of a range of viruses, or demonstrate the effectiveness of face covering in limiting the novel coronavirus spread.
6. ""Effectiveness not studied."" 
""Absolutely no peer-reviewed studies have been carried out of mask effectiveness within a social environment to control, prevent or eliminate the spread of disease.""
Both papers cited by Neuman are published and peer reviewed. One was published in April by the journal Nature and the other on June 11 by the National Academy of Sciences. In terms of being ""within a social environment,"" 246 individuals provided exhaled breath samples in the first study, roughly half with masks and half without; the second study was a review of coronavirus mitigation efforts undertaken in Wuhan, China, Italy and New York City.
Said Rasmussen: ""It’s true that to my knowledge masks have not been subjected to a large, randomized clinical trial, but a growing body of evidence does suggest that masks substantially reduce droplet spread.""

Speculation about the origin of the novel coronavirus has spread online since the beginning of the pandemic, with Facebook posts and tabloids making baseless claims the virus was created in a lab.
But it isn’t only social media users who have perpetuated the conspiracy theory the virus was bioengineered. In Illinois, a prominent state politician suggested the same thing:
""This man-made killer — whoever went in there and man-made it, perhaps they should be in there now trying to figure out how to turn this around,"" Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford of Maywood said during a May 15 appearance on Fox 32.
""I don’t believe it’s a natural virus,"" Lightford continued, after the program’s host asked Lightford if she thinks the virus did not occur naturally. ""I believe someone was in cahoots for some reason and I think it just got a little bit out of control and spread a whole lot further than they anticipated.""
But to leading experts, the research is clear: the genetic structure of the virus shows it could not have been created in a lab — or be ""man-made,"" as Lightford claimed.
An article published March 17 in Nature Medicine says the genetic makeup of the coronavirus does not indicate it was altered. Instead, the researchers who conducted the analysis present two plausible explanations for the origin of the virus: natural selection in an animal host, or natural selection in humans after the virus spread from animals.
That finding doesn’t rule out the much-publicized theory the virus may have somehow escaped from a lab in China where it was being studied, though the government there has denied this. But what is known makes it clear the virus itself is not the result of human tampering.
""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" the article states, using the scientific name for the virus that causes COVID-19.

If Your Time is short





Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company that manufactures hydroxychloroquine. It has donated 30 million doses to the U.S.


While Novartis paid Giuliani a speaker’s fee in 2006, there is no publicly available evidence that he currently has a financial stake in the company. He has denied having one in press reports.


Financial disclosure documents indicate that Trump does not have a current connection to Novartis.





See the sources for this fact-check




Rudy Giuliani’s promotion of a lupus and arthritis drug to treat COVID-19 patients is raising eyebrows about his motivation.
In an interview with Fox News on April 5, Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, said hydroxychloroquine could potentially be used to alleviate symptoms associated with the coronavirus.
""I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy,"" he said. ""Everything shows that it works.""
Giuliani’s comments echo what Trump has said over the past few weeks, despite the fact that medical experts still don’t know much about the drug’s efficacy against COVID-19. (Not every study shows that it works, for instance.) But a tweet published the same day as the Fox interview claims Giuliani has ulterior motives for promoting the drug.
""Here @whpresscorps Ask Trump about THIS!!"" @Wiseronenow said in the tweet. ""‘Giuliani, in early February, bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine. How many shares did Sean Hannity & the Trump family buy?’""

(Screenshot from Twitter)
The tweet was referred to us by VineSight, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. We found the same claim circulating on Facebook, where some posts also implicated President Donald Trump.
""Novartis also paid Michael Cohen $1M in payments in 2016,"" one post reads, referring to Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney. ""Also Trump had a 1 on 1 meeting with Novartis CEO in January 2020.""
We’ve seen a lot of misinformation about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, so we wanted to take a closer look at Giuliani and Trump’s financial interests in the drugs and their manufacturers.
We could find no evidence that Giuliani purchased stock in Novartis in early February. The company paid Cohen more than $1 million in consulting fees in 2017, not 2016. And while Trump did attend a dinner with a Novartis leader in January, it was not a one-on-one meeting with the CEO.
How Novartis is related to hydroxychloroquine
Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company. It has donated hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile for use in treating COVID-19 patients.
On March 29, the Department of Health and Human Services published a statement saying that it had accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz, the generics division of Novartis. The company said in an earlier press release that it plans to give out 130 million doses by the end of May.
The donation came after Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19. But the research is far from settled.
RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know
Two studies, one from France and one from China, found that hydroxychloroquine helped people clear the virus quickly and alleviate symptoms. But two other studies found that the drug had no discernible effect on the coronavirus. With more than 50 studies still in the works, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 is still unproven. 
Novartis has said criticism that the drug is unproven and the company is profiting from it is ""without merit."" Now let’s take a closer look at any ties to Trump and his lawyers.
Company has ties to former Trump associate
While Novartis has paid Giuliani in the past, we could find no evidence that the former New York mayor has a current financial connection to the company.

A 2007 financial disclosure form from Giuliani, who campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, shows that Novartis paid him a $60,000 gross speaker fee on Feb. 6, 2006. The company is not listed anywhere else on the form.
The New York Times reported that Giuliani’s interest in hydroxychloroquine stems in part from his contact with Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a New York physician who has been giving the drug to people with coronavirus-like symptoms. Giuliani told the Times he does not have any financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
Novartis has had connections with another Trump associate.
In May 2018, the company disclosed that it had paid Cohen, the former Trump personal attorney, for health care policy consulting. A Senate report published in July 2018 outlined how Cohen had received $1.2 million over a 12-month period ending in February 2018.
A month after the deal was signed, Novartis ""determined he would not be able to provide the anticipated services,"" according to the report. However, Cohen was still paid for a year under the terms of the contract.
In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations and lying to Congress.
What about Trump’s own interests?
The connection between Cohen and Novartis has led some to speculate that Trump has financial motives for promoting hydroxychloroquine. Some Facebook users have claimed Trump met with the company ""one on one"" in January, making his recent promotion of the drug suspicious.
There’s little evidence to back either claim up.
Trump’s financial disclosure forms indicate that he has not held stock in Novartis since taking office. The last form filed was in May 2019.
The New York Times reported that the president does have a stake in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund. But the stake is rather small; the Washington Post reported that it’s ""between about $100 and $1,500 in total.""
RELATED: Why experts worry about President Trump touting chloroquine
As for the purported ""meeting"" between Trump and Novartis, there was a dinner the president attended with the company’s chairman — not its CEO — in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. The event included a slew of executives from other companies around the world.
Even if Trump or his associates did have some stake in Novartis, it’s uncertain whether they’d reap financial benefits from the increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine. The company is donating, not selling, nearly its entire supply of the drug.
""Any rumors that Novartis stands to benefit financially or otherwise from the donation of hydroxychloroquine is without merit,"" a company spokesman told PolitiFact in an email.
Novartis shares spiked briefly after Trump began touting chloroquine on March 19, but since then they have performed about as well as the broader stock market.
Our ruling
A tweet claimed that Rudy Giuliani bought $2 million in shares of Novartis in February.
We could find no evidence that Giuliani has a current financial connection to Novartis, which has donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. The company did pay consulting fees to a former Trump associate, but documents don’t show any financial connection between the president himself and Novartis. The meeting that Trump had with the company’s chairman in January was not one on one — it included many other business executives.
Bottom line: Available evidence does not show any financial link between Giuliani or Trump and Novartis. Barring additional evidence, the tweet is inaccurate.

As the world reacted to President Donald Trump’s positive coronavirus test some people noticed a seemingly partisan disparity in who has contracted the virus.
""Does anyone else find it odd that no prominent Democrats have had the virus but the list of Republicans goes on and on?"" said DeAnna Lorraine in an Oct. 2 tweet.
Lorraine is a former Republican congressional candidate who ran to represent California's 12th Congressional District this year. She lost in the primary election on March 3.
Lorraine’s tweet has been shared thousands of times on Twitter and Facebook, where some posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

After Trump tweeted that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus, several people the president came in contact with also got tested. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his runningmate, Sen. Kamala Harris, tested negative.

But Lorraine’s claim is wrong. 
Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have not contracted the coronavirus. But the same could also be said for Republican leaders. Meanwhile, several Democratic mayors and governors have contracted the virus, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.
NPR has been keeping tabs on specific members of Congress who have tested positive for the coronavirus or quarantined after being exposed to it. According to the list, three Republican senators and nine representatives have tested positive or were presumed to have the coronavirus since the pandemic began. That’s more than the Democrats, who have had no senators  and six representatives test positive for the virus.
Polls suggest that Republicans are less likely than Democrats to view the coronavirus as a serious public health threat. Republican representatives have also been less inclined to wear face masks during meetings and hearings, and more likely to hold in-person rallies and events. Both go against what public health authorities have recommended for slowing the spread of the coronavirus.

Tweets","Viral tweet cites made-up CDC ‘COVID-19 survival rates’ to downplay vaccine




If Your Time is short





The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not released “COVID-19 survival rates,” an agency spokesperson said, and it doesn’t have the data to do so.


It’s difficult to pin down a statistic like the “survival rate” with precision.





See the sources for this fact-check




As the U.S. continues to distribute the first COVID-19 vaccines, a viral tweet shared what it said were ""COVID-19 survival rates"" from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to downplay the severity of the virus and the need for vaccinations.
""CDC COVID-19 Survival Rates,"" said the emoji-filled tweet from Emma Jimenez, a conservative blogger and activist. ""Age 0-19 — 99.997%. Age 20-49 — 99.98%. Age 50-69 — 99.5%. Age 70+ — 94.6%. Why is a COVID-19 vaccine being pushed out so aggressively? Hmmmm.""
Screenshots of the tweet were also shared on Facebook and Instagram, where they were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 

A screenshot of a viral tweet shared to Facebook that wrongly claimed to show the CDC's COVID-19 survival rates.
The age-specific ""survival rates"" listed in the post did not come from the CDC, however. CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed told PolitiFact that the agency has not released any age-specific COVID-19 survival rates, nor does it have mortality rates available.
""Survival analysis is highly complex,"" Reed said. ""CDC does not have the data to calculate survivability for COVID-19. Unclear as to where social media users are getting this information.""
""We don’t have that data, so we don’t know,"" added Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida. ""And neither would the person who posted (the tweet).""
Sketchy sourcing
The tweet didn’t cite a specific CDC source for its ""COVID-19 survival rates."" PolitiFact tried to reach Jimenez through messages to her Conservative Latina Twitter and Facebook accounts, but we did not hear back.
The figures line up with parameters included as part of CDC planning scenarios designed to help public health agencies model the impact of the pandemic. 
In a September document labeled ""COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios,"" the agency listed five sets of parameters that represented different levels of disease severity and transmissibility, with the goal of helping public health agencies make models to estimate the effects of the virus.

stated on June 2, 2021 in an Instagram post








An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The infection fatality rates listed under the scenario marked as the ""current best estimate"" correspond with the ""survival rates"" listed in the tweet. But those infection fatality rates, the document says, are based on data through Aug. 8. And there are other caveats.
Lead Stories debunked a Facebook post citing the same scenarios to wrongly claim that the CDC had downgraded the severity of COVID-19 to something less than the flu. 
The CDC document says the scenarios ""are not predictions of the expected effects of COVID-19"" and ""do not reflect the impact of any behavioral changes, social distancing, or other interventions."" It also says ""uncertainty remains around nearly all parameter values.""
The tweet also ignored the toll a seemingly small fatality rate can take when a disease spreads unchecked. Johns Hopkins University puts the observed case fatality ratio — calculated as the number of known deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases — at about 1.8% for the U.S. At that rate, if every American got COVID-19, there would be almost 6 million deaths.
Doctors have gotten better at treating the disease since the outbreak of the pandemic, PolitiFact reported. But the numbers of new COVID-19 cases and deaths reported each day in the U.S. have skyrocketed in recent weeks. ""Excess deaths"" remain above historical norms. The risk of severe illness from the coronavirus increases with age, the CDC says. 
Survival rates are hard to estimate
In a pandemic, it’s difficult to nail down data points like survival rates, Prins told PolitiFact. Such rates are usually calculated for a longer period of time rather than as a snapshot.
""Deaths and reporting of deaths lag behind the identification of new cases, sometimes for months, so we never quite catch up with knowing who has ‘survived’ unless we set a time period that we’re looking at, like we do with five-year survival rates in cancers, or the disease goes away and we can look back at the pandemic as a whole,"" Prins said.
""In addition, we know that there are side effects of COVID-19 like myocarditis that may show up well after ‘recovery’ but could cause death at that later time, so both survival rates and mortality rates are more accurate after some time has passed.""
A widespread vaccination effort would prevent more deaths, protect people from severe illness, slow the spread and put the U.S. on a path back to normal.
Our ruling

Donald Trump","Trump wrongly said insurance companies will waive co-pays for coronavirus treatments




If Your Time is short





Health insurance companies said they will waive costs for coronavirus tests, not treatment.


A shortage in diagnostic supplies means that testing is limited.


A major health insurance lobbying group said that there are currently no industry-wide plans to waive costs for hospital stays or other treatment.





See the sources for this fact-check




As coronavirus cases multiply in the United States, one concern Americans have is what they can expect to pay if they seek treatment. 
Speaking from the White House, President Donald Trump suggested that people with health insurance shouldn’t have to worry about that.
""Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of the health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing,"" Trump said March 11.
We found that’s an exaggeration at best.
We contacted spokespeople for the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services seeking clarification and did not get a response. But in an appearance March 12 on CNN, Vice President Mike Pence said insurers have agreed to waive copays for coronavirus tests — not treatment. 
The telecast of Trump’s March 10 meeting with the insurance industry shows that, in fact, company leaders agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus tests — not treatments.
""All the insurance companies here — either today or before today — have agreed to waive all copays on coronavirus testing and extend coverage for coronavirus treatment in all of their benefit plans,"" Pence said.
That’s a big distinction.
An incomplete picture
For one thing, a shortage in diagnostic supplies means that many people aren’t receiving tests. You have to present symptoms to qualify. If you don’t receive a test, but do get screened, that qualifies as a doctor’s visit — not a coronavirus test. That qualifies for a copay.
""It’s not even waiving copays or deductibles for services you need to get tests — emergency visits, doctors, etc.,"" noted Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. ""It’s ‘we’ll waive copays for the tests,’ which is the lab service.""
Health plans will cover treatment for coronavirus, including hospital stays, said Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, a major lobbying group. But they won’t necessarily waive copays or cost-sharing for that treatment.
And there are other nuances to getting treatment that might entail higher cost-sharing. If a coronavirus diagnosis ultimately means a patient needs to be put in a private room, or some other form of isolation, that’s a service that costs more. And even if it’s covered, patients could end up paying part of the price out-of-pocket, Corlette said.
For surprise medical bills, it’s trickier. There is a lot insurance plans can do, such as waiving in-network cost-sharing when someone gets treatment for the coronavirus, or agreeing to change their benefit structure if a patient gets care from someone out of network. But they don’t appear to have explicitly committed to doing those things, Corlette said.
And the responsibility for surprise billing doesn’t just fall on insurance companies, said Zack Cooper, a health economist at Yale University, who studies surprise billing. Doctors and hospitals who are out-of-network are still able to balance bill — that is, send patients a bill for whatever insurance has not paid. 
Plus, big insurance companies are only part of the picture. About 61% of Americans with employer-sponsored health care have what is called a ""self-insured"" plan. Those plans, which are regulated by federal law,  can opt out of the agreements around copayments.

With all those caveats, Corlette said, Trump’s assertion is ""misleading.""
What the insurance plans said
The statements released by health insurance companies about waived costs are not as comprehensive as Trump indicated. 
UnitedHealthcare announced that it has ""waived all member cost sharing, including copays, coinsurance and deductibles, for COVID-19 diagnostic testing provided at approved locations in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for all commercial insured, Medicaid and Medicare members. UnitedHealthcare is also supporting self-insured customers choosing to implement similar actions.""
Ethan Slavin, a spokesman for Aetna, gave a similar response: He said the company will waive associated costs for members who get tested ""at any authorized location.""
Anthem announced March 6 that it would provide coverage of the coronavirus screening test at no out-of-pocket-cost.
But again, those commitments are not comprehensive.
The statement by UnitedHealthcare doesn’t state that they are waiving all cost-sharing with respect to all emergency treatment or post stabilization, for example.
""The only place you can get tested in a lot of communities is still the hospital emergency room department, so that’s an emergency visit,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University professor of health law and policy.
While the White House meeting shows that at the moment health insurance companies have agreed to not charge copays for the tests, the rules could change rapidly for other costs, said Thomas Miller, an expert on health care policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
""Looking over the horizon we are going to be doing a lot of things differently,"" he said.
Joseph Antos, another health care expert at AEI, said that since the final bills for treatment are settled after the patient has been treated, that allows negotiation or other consideration for patients who can’t cover what could be very high cost-sharing amounts in full.
""Most higher income people with good insurance should be able to deal with those costs and should not expect additional discounts related to coronavirus,"" he said.
It’s also possible that Congress will decide to pass surprise billing legislation given the circumstances.
Our ruling
Trump said the health insurance industry has ""agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments.""
This isn’t what those companies said. They agreed to waive copayments for coronavirus testing. That’s only one component, and it’s a far cry from waiving copayments for all treatment. And, despite what the president’s phrasing may imply, the Americans who seek a test and are turned away will not have their copayments waived either.
Patients who seek testing for coronavirus, and even those who end up needing treatment, will likely still end up facing medical bills. The size and scope depends on their insurance plans, and on what doctors they see.

Joy Behar","‘The View’ co-host Joy Behar wrongly says Trump shut down 37 global anti-pandemic programs




If Your Time is short





News reports in early 2018 said the CDC was preparing to scale back its anti-pandemic programs in some countries because an early source of funding was running out and the agency didn’t expect to receive new money from the Trump administration.


The spending bills that lawmakers ultimately passed provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump’s budget requests asked for.


The programs are part of the Global Health Security Agenda, an initiative to help countries reduce their vulnerability to infectious diseases.





See the sources for this fact-check




Joy Behar, a co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" accused President Donald Trump of dismantling anti-pandemic programs the Obama administration set up across the globe.
Barack Obama ""set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus, exactly,"" Behar said during the March 9 episode of the show. ""Do you know that Trump closed 37 of them?""
The TV host’s claim is wrong, and it’s not entirely clear how she got her numbers, either.

Trump did fail to replace top national-security officials in charge of coordinating the U.S. response to pandemics, and he unsuccessfully sought to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But he never slashed the programs Behar was referring to, however.
As the Washington Post noted, there were concerns among global-health leaders that U.S. funding for an initiative known as the Global Health Security Agenda was running out, and that some U.S.-run pandemic-prevention programs would have to be downsized as a result. 
But the Trump administration never pulled the plug on those programs, although it did propose smaller budgets. Congress has injected more money into them in recent budget requests.
One day after we reached out to ABC for comment, Behar made a tongue-in-cheek correction on air.
""The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries,"" Behar said. ""I’m happy to say, he only attempted to cut funding for them, but that did not ultimately go into effect. Isn’t that good?""
Why the CDC thought its programs had to shrink
The CDC has been operating public-health programs in a number of foreign countries as part the Global Health Security Agenda, which the United States helped launch in 2014.
The initiative — which now includes 67 countries — is a global effort to help countries reduce the risk of infectious diseases. 
The bulk of its early funding came from a one-time, five-year emergency spending bill that Congress approved in late 2014 to respond to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The package appropriated almost $600 million for the CDC ""to support national public health institutes and global health security.""
The CDC had hoped those funds would be replenished once the five-year supplement expired in October 2019, according to reports. But as the expiration date approached, it looked like the agency could be left with just the core annual budget to pull from.
National news outlets reported in the spring of 2018 that the CDC was bracing for a possible funding drop-off. The CDC planned to scale back operations in 39 of 49 countries and focus on 10 ""priority countries,"" according to emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.
In the end, however, Congress provided enough funding to sustain the programs, experts told us. (The White House and CDC did not respond to our requests for comment. The CDC told Factcheck.org it ""did not have to cut back its work"" to 10 countries.)
""The president's budget proposed slashing funding for CDC's (global health security) initiatives,"" added Claire Standley, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security. ""In the end, that didn't happen.""

By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







The worry in early 2018 was that the budget for the CDC’s global disease-prevention programs would be just over $50 million, as it had been in past years, when the supplement from 2014 was still the primary funding source. Trump’s 2018 budget proposal put it in that ballpark.
But the budget Congress ultimately passed bumped the appropriations for ""global disease detection and other programs"" up to $108.2 million. The same amount was provided in 2019.
In November 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services pledged an additional $150 million ""to support capacity strengthening in high-risk countries around the world"" at a meeting in which the U.S. affirmed its commitment to the next phase of the Global Health Security Agenda.
The Trump administration’s 2021 budget request appropriated $225 million for the same global-health programs, up from $183.2 million in 2020.
As we’ve reported, Trump has consistently proposed cuts to certain CDC budgets, but the bills Congress ultimately passed — with Trump’s signature — have steadily increased funding for the CDC’s infectious-disease activities.
Experts said the administration’s wavering support has likely made it difficult for the CDC to plan out its activities.
""I don't think the 37 out of 47 statement is accurate,"" Standley said. ""But I do think that the Trump administration, in failing to provide consistent funding and clear indication of the priority placed on global health security capacity building, has made it difficult for the CDC to sustain the programs and successful efforts put into place since 2014.""
""Programs weren’t shut down in the end, but you can also say that the administration didn’t prioritize them in the proposed budget,"" added Jennifer Nuzzi, an associate professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
A problem with the numbers
It’s not clear why Behar referred to a shutdown of 37 of 47 programs when the 2018 news reports said the CDC was considering scaling back 39 of 49 operations. 
It’s possible she pulled from a tweet by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose claim that Trump ""shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs"" was debunked by other fact-checkers. But however you crunch the numbers, it’s hard to get to 47 countries — or 49, for that matter.
Trump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus.

He is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics. 

He shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs. 

Trump made a choice to make us vulnerable...to this pandemic and the next one and the next one.— Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 25, 2020 
A 2019 annual report on the Global Health Security Agenda says the CDC provides financial support and technical assistance to 17 priority countries, plus technical assistance for 14 countries and CARICOM, a group of 15 Caribbean countries and dependencies.
One CARICOM country is Haiti, which is already listed among the countries receiving technical assistance from the CDC. Another is Montserrat, a British territory. 
That adds up to 44 total countries, or 50 if you include six other countries that Standley said received some early support specifically related to the Ebola outbreak. 
Our ruling
Behar said Obama ""set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus"" and ""Trump closed 37 of them.""
News reports in 2018 said the CDC was planning to shrink its operations to help foreign countries prevent infectious diseases because it didn’t expect to receive new funding once the supplement it received in 2014 ran out. But the programs didn’t shut down in the end.
The spending bill that lawmakers ultimately passed that year provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump’s budget request originally asked for.

Coronavirus







Greg Abbott","Calculating herd immunity is more than 'simple math'




Gov. Greg Abbott is optimistic about the state of the coronavirus pandemic in Texas, where the trend line of daily new cases has dropped from wintertime highs to springtime lows not seen since September.  
The reason behind his optimism, he told Fox News host Chris Wallace during an April 11 interview, is based on ""simple math."" 
""We absolutely aren't declaring victory at this time. We remain very vigilant and guarded and proactive in our response, but there's simple math behind the reason why we continue to have success,"" Abbott said. 
He went on: ""When you add all the number of vaccinations that are taking place, as well as all of the acquired immunity from Texans who have been exposed and recovered from COVID-19, it means, very simply, it’s a whole lot more difficult for COVID to be spreading to other people in the state of Texas."" 
Abbott’s calculation begged Wallace’s next question: ""Do you think you have herd immunity in Texas now?"" 
""It looks like it could be very close to herd immunity,"" Abbott replied. 
As of April 12, about 5.8 million people had been fully vaccinated in Texas, or about 20% of the state population, according to state data. Additionally, the state has recorded about 2.8 million positive cases or probable cases, identified through antigen testing, since the beginning of the pandemic. Subtract from that total the 50,000 cases that have resulted in deaths. The rest, about 2.75 million Texans, have recovered from infection and are presumed to have some level of natural immunity to future infection.
Does the combined number of vaccinated people plus those with natural immunity — a total of 8.55 million people in a population of 29 million — bring Texas ""very close to herd immunity""? We found that there are several other factors and caveats that Abbott’s equation omits. Calculating a population’s immunity level and its herd immunity threshold is more than a matter of simple math. 
What is the herd immunity threshold? 
In his interview with Wallace, Abbott said that even though he thinks Texas is ""very close"" to reaching herd immunity, he doesn’t know what the herd immunity threshold is. And epidemiologists agree that a population’s threshold is somewhat of a moving target.  
Simply defined, herd immunity threshold is the percentage of a population that must be immunized from a disease, be it through infections or vaccinations, for the spread to abate. The more infectious a contagion, the higher its threshold. 
Measles, for instance, is a highly infectious disease that is at least three times as contagious as COVID-19. Measles requires a herd immunity threshold level of around 94%, meaning that 94% of a population will need to be immune to measles before its transmission rate declines. This has been achieved through the widespread use of vaccinations. 
COVID-19's herd immunity threshold level is not yet known. Most estimates have placed the threshold at 60%-70%, according to the peer-reviewed science journal Nature. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor and director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has cited a range of threshold levels that has changed as more has been learned about the virus.  
Early on in the pandemic Fauci said that threshold was around 60% to 70%. In December, Fauci cited higher figures, saying ""I would think that you would need somewhere between 70, 75, maybe 80%,"" during a CNBC interview. 
Dr. James McDeavitt, dean of clinical affairs at Baylor College of Medicine, shares Abbott’s optimism about Texas making progress toward herd immunity, but he says that we won’t know we’ve reached herd immunity until well after we’ve achieved it.  
""There are a lot of variables for what actually constitutes herd immunity threshold, and the reality is I don’t think we’ll know when we achieve it until we’re looking backwards,"" McDeavitt said. 
If vaccination rates continue at today’s pace, eventually Texas will see the rate of new daily cases drop to very low levels. After those levels remain low for three to four weeks, he says, scientists could safely say that we’ve surpassed the herd immunity threshold.
""When we see that occur, we can look back and say we achieved herd immunity,"" McDeavitt said. ""But I don't think anybody can do a calculation and predict when that's going to happen."" 
Abbott’s ‘simple math’ 
Abbott mentioned two factors that contribute to a population’s immunity — the number of fully vaccinated people and the known number of people who have recovered from COVID-19. These two categories total 8.55 million people, or about 30% of the state population.  
An Abbott spokesperson later clarified that the governor also was including the ""true number of recoveries,"" or the category of people who contracted COVID-19 but were never tested and thus never included in the state’s case count. His spokesperson pointed to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s estimation that only 1 in 4.6 actual infections have been reported.

The CDC says that official case numbers ""likely represent only a fraction of the true number of cases that have occurred in the population,"" and there’s a variety of reasons why cases may go undetected, including asymptomatic people who were never aware of their infection, and people who suffered symptoms but never sought health care. 
According to Abbott’s spokesperson, applying the CDC’s estimation to Texas would mean that another 10 million cases have gone undetected. Adding in that total would bring Texas’ immunity rate up to around 60%, the spokesperson said. 
Officials at the Texas Department of State Health Services did not respond to questions asking for an evaluation of Abbott's calculation. 
But applying the CDC’s estimate to Texas is just one of several ways to calculate the unknown number of cases in the population, said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
""There is a significant portion of the population that has acquired immunity — they've been infected and they've recovered,"" he said. ""How big of a slice of the population is that? That's up for debate."" 
The University of Texas Coronavirus Antibody Response Survey takes a different approach to estimating that total. It estimates that the seroprevalence rate in Texas, or the percent of people with COVID-19 antibodies in their bloodstream, is around 26%. Under those estimates, around 5.1 million cases in Texas could have gone unreported. That would peg Texas’ immunity rate at around 45%. 
""It’s a guess, because we just don't have all the information at our fingertips,"" said Michaud. ""But triangulating from different surveys, from different models, you can kind of get a sense of what we're talking about here."" 
There are other factors that Abbott’s ""simple math"" omits. First, there’s an overlap in the number of people who have had a prior infection and received a vaccine, yet there’s no way to tell how many people fall into both categories, experts said. 
Second, none of the available vaccines are 100% effective. The Pfizer vaccine is reportedly 95% effective; the Moderna vaccine is 86% effective; and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, now suspended, is 72% effective. 
Furthermore, there’s also uncertainty about whether fully vaccinated people could transmit the virus to others.  
""We hope that within the next five or so months we’ll be able to answer the very important question about whether vaccinated people get infected asymptomatically, and if they do, do they transmit the infection to others,"" Fauci said in a March 26 White House press briefing. 
These factors — the overlap between vaccinated and recovered people and the unlucky people unprotected by the vaccine — would subtract from Abbott's estimated level of immunity, Michaud said.
Health officials also urge anyone who’s ever had a prior infection to get vaccinated because acquiring antibodies through natural infection does not offer as much protection against the virus or its variants. It’s also unclear how long natural immunity lasts. Take for example Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, a coronavirus skeptic who has famously been diagnosed with COVID-19 three times.  
""The governor said that we are ‘close’ to herd immunity. Depending on your definition of ‘close,’ that may be the case,"" Michaud said. 
""We are getting closer to herd immunity, however you define it, because we're vaccinating more people over time. But are we there now? The answer is probably no. But when we will get there and what level do we need to get there are still open questions that people are debating,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Abbott said that Texas ""could be very close to herd immunity"" during an interview on Fox News. He said he based this assessment on ""simple math,"" which is the number of people who have been fully vaccinated plus those who have natural immunity — those who have been infected and recovered and an estimated number of those who were infected and were not tested. 
About 5.8 million people, or 20% of the state population, has been fully vaccinated as of April 12. The total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 is not known, although various estimates show that it ranges from 25%-40% of the state population.
Adding those totals together would mean that the state's immunity level ranges from 45-60%, while the herd immunity threshold is understood to range between 60-80%.
However, other factors would subtract from the state's immunity level, like the fraction of people who receive a vaccine but aren’t protected, or the overlap of people who recovered from prior infection and received a vaccine. But there are no estimations for how many people fall into either of these categories, experts said.
Furthermore, health officials urge everyone to get vaccinated — whether or not they've recovered from a past infection — because immunity from vaccines is known to be more durable than natural immunity.

Donald Trump","No, the WHO didn’t change its lockdowns stance or ‘admit’ Trump was right




If Your Time is short




President Donald Trump’s statement was based on a short video clip of an interview with Dr. David Nabarro, a special envoy to the World Health Organization. The clip didn’t include the full context of Nabarro’s comments.

 
The WHO has consistently stated throughout the course of the pandemic that lockdowns should be employed only when COVID-19 cases are high, to give governments and health systems time to reorganize efforts. They should not be the primary strategy to combat COVID-19 transmission.

 
The WHO has acknowledged since the spring that lockdowns have economic consequences for localities and nations.




See the sources for this fact-check




On Monday, President Donald Trump claimed that the World Health Organization (WHO) ""admitted"" he was correct that using lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19 was more damaging than the illness.
In a post on Twitter, Trump wrote: ""The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!""
He reiterated his statement later that night during a campaign rally, saying, ""But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where they’re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You can’t do that.""
Together, the tweet and these comments got considerable attention on social media.
But did the WHO change its stance on lockdowns or concede anything to Trump, as he said it did? Briefly, no.
Since May,  Trump has been vocal about asking states to reopen businesses, schools, religious services and other social activities. He also took credit for locking down the U.S. in the early stages of the pandemic, however. And his administration largely delegated lockdown decisions to governors and local governments.
Yet those lockdowns — marked by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions — have been less stringent than those implemented in other countries, said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University.
The ""definition has differed country by country and state by state. I would argue that the U.S. has never had an actual enforced lockdown like there have been in some Asian countries and in Italy last spring,"" Nichols wrote in an email.
We reached out to the Trump campaign and the White House to ask for more information about Trump’s assertion but didn’t receive a response.
A clip doesn’t tell the full story
Although the Trump team didn’t get back to us, we noticed that the Trump War Room Twitter account responded to Trump’s tweet with a link to a video, appearing to back up the president’s claim.
The video is a clip from an Oct. 8 interview with Dr. David Nabarro, a special envoy on COVID-19 for the WHO, by Scottish journalist Andrew Neil. The segment was televised by the British news outlet Spectator TV.
In response to a question about the economic consequences of lockdowns, Nabarro said: ""We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources; protect your health workers who are exhausted. But by and large, we’d rather not do it."" Nabarro then went on to describe potential economic consequences, including effects on the tourism industry and farmers or the worsening of world poverty.
We checked with Nabarro to find out if the clip accurately reflected the points he raised during a nearly 20-minute interview. He responded, by email: ""My comments were taken totally out of context. The WHO position is consistent.""
That context Nabarro mentioned covered a range of topics, such as the estimate that about 90% of the world’s population is still vulnerable to COVID-19, that lockdowns are only an effective pandemic response in extreme circumstances and what Nabarro means when he talks about finding the ""middle path.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







""We’re saying we really do have to learn how to coexist with this virus in a way that doesn’t require constant closing down of economies, but at the same time in a way that is not associated with high levels of suffering and death,"" Nabarro said in the interview.
To achieve that via the middle path approach, robust defenses against the virus must be put in place, said Nabarro, including having well-organized public health services, such as testing, contact tracing and isolation. It also involves communities adhering to public health guidelines such as wearing masks, physical distancing and practicing good hygiene.
So, it’s really not accurate for the president to imply that the WHO has or has not supported lockdowns, said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University. It’s not as simple as an either-or choice.
""No one is saying that lockdowns should never be used, just that they shouldn't be used as a primary or only method,"" Gostin wrote in an email.
And Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, said both the WHO and public health experts have acknowledged there are economic consequences to lockdowns. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)
""Strict lockdowns are best used sparingly and in a time-limited fashion because they can cause negative health and economic consequences,"" said Michaud. ""That is why Nabarro said lockdowns are not recommended as the ‘primary’ control measure. Critics like to frame lockdowns as being recommended as the only measure, when in reality that is not the case.""
Has the WHO flipped on its stance on lockdowns?
And what about Trump’s assertion that the WHO had changed its position and admitted he was right?
A member of the WHO media office told us in a statement, ""Our position on lockdowns and other severe movement restrictions has been consistent since the beginning. We recognize that they are costly to societies, economies and individuals, but may need to be used if COVID-19 transmission is out of control.""
""WHO has never advocated for national lockdowns as a primary means for controlling the virus. Dr. Nabarro was repeating our advice to governments to ‘do it all,’"" the spokesperson said.
To test this premise, we looked at statements by WHO leaders over the course of the pandemic. In the multiple media briefings we reviewed from February onward, the WHO appeared consistent in its messaging about what lockdowns should be deployed for: to give governments time to respond to a high number of COVID-19 cases and get a reprieve for health care workers. Although WHO leaders in February supported the shutting down of the city of Wuhan, China, the presumed source of the COVID-19 outbreak, they have also acknowledged that lockdowns can have serious economic effects, and that robust testing, contact tracing and physical distancing are usually preferable to completely locking down.
There is also no evidence the WHO ""admitted"" Trump was right about lockdowns.
Our ruling
Trump tweeted on Monday and then said later that night at a campaign rally that the WHO admitted he was right about lockdowns.
We found no evidence the WHO made this admission. And, based on a review of WHO communications, we found its messaging on the topic has been consistent since the pandemic’s early days.
Trump also appears to have relied on a brief video clip of a wide-ranging interview with WHO special envoy Dr. David Nabarro that didn’t give an accurate portrayal of how Nabarro characterized the use of this intervention.

Bloggers","Obama administration did not provide $3.8 million to Wuhan virology lab




If Your Time is short





A virology lab in Wuhan received about $600,000 over five years from the U.S. government. Some of the money came while Trump was president. The grant was part of an effort to spot viruses in wildlife that might jump and infect humans.


The best genetic analysis to date says the virus that causes COVID-19 was not created in a lab.





See the sources for this fact-check




A Facebook post alerted readers to this ""breaking news"":
""President Trump just announced that the ‘biological’ lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was ‘funded’ by President Barak (sp) Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars! This fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!""
A different post makes a similar point: ""Well well well, in 2015 Obama gave the Chinese lab in Wuhan 3.7M grant to study the corona virus what a coincidence.""
The first post builds on the conspiracy theory that the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China created the virus. 
It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
There’s nothing correct in this post, although President Donald Trump does play a supporting role in spreading some of the inaccurate information at the heart of the claim.
Here’s where the post either misleads or flat out gets things wrong.
""The ‘biological’ lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created.""
Early on in the crisis, the idea took hold that the virology lab in Wuhan engineered the virus. We looked at that claim in detail before and found that the genetic sequence of the virus shows no signs of genetic engineering.
A research team at Scripps Research compared the virus to viruses that had hit humans, such as the one behind the SARS outbreak, and viruses that are found in animals. All the evidence pointed to a natural source.
""We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the researchers wrote.
There are unresolved concerns that protective lapses at the lab may have allowed a virus collected from nature to escape, and to be clear, that is an unproven allegation, and Chinese officials deny it. But that is different from the virus being intentionally manufactured by human hands.
The lab was funded by Obama ""in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars!""
The correct amount sent to the Wuhan virology lab is $598,500, and that was spread over five years, according to the American research group running the project.
Here’s what we know about the lab, that work and the U.S. funding.
In 2014, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed a project by the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including many in Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam and China.
The 2014 project focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. In 2018, alliance researchers reported they had found a virus in bats very similar to SARS.
""If we know what viruses are out there in wildlife, and which people are getting infected, we have a chance to stop pandemics dead in their tracks,"" the group’s president Peter Daszak said in a press release at the time.

The group contracted the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct the genetic analyses of the viruses that were being collected in the field. The lab was selected after it was approved by the U.S. State Department and NIH.
The National Institutes of Health website shows a total award of about $3.4 million over six years to EcoHealth Alliance. The group’s spokesman Robert Kessler told us that, of that, the Wuhan lab received just under $600,000.
That’s about 85% less than the Facebook post asserted.
That NIH spending included about $265,000 for the lab under the Trump administration. In 2019, NIH renewed the grant to EcoHealth Alliance for another five years. That decision came on Trump’s watch and he said ""we will end that grant very quickly.""
""President Trump just announced""
There is a virology lab in Wuhan, and it did get money from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. But the post exaggerates what Trump said about that.
In an April 17 White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter from the conservative website Newsmax asked Trump about the grant. Here’s the exchange:
Reporter: ""(There’s a) report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?""
Trump: ""The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million? I’ve been hearing about that. And we’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area — we’re looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly.
""But it was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We’re going to look at it and take a look. But I understand it was a number of years ago, right?
""When did you hear — when did you hear it was — the grant was made?""
Reporter: ""2015.""
Trump: ""2015? Who was president then? I wonder.""
Trump didn’t announce anything. He responded to the reporter’s question about the grant and said he’d heard about certain reports and was looking into it.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said Trump announced that a lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus ""was created"" received $3.8 million under the Obama administration.
A reader would see this claim and assume millions of U.S. tax dollars were used to create the virus that leads to COVID-19. That isn’t the case.
Trump didn’t make this announcement. He was responding to a reporter’s question.
The best evidence so far says the virus was not created in a lab.
The money that went to the lab was about 85% less than what the post said.

In an average month, about 4,000 people die from suicide.


In the month of June, over 19,000 people died from the coronavirus. In the past 30 days, nearly 22,000 people died.


Researchers say there is no way that the rate of suicide could increase so rapidly.

Super Bowl champion Tom Brady told his Instagram followers that suicide accounts for more death than COVID-19.
""More suicide deaths than coronavirus death past two months,"" Brady had on his Oct. 27 post. ""So wash your hands and wear your mask, but don’t forget to be nice to people and yourself.""
We reached out to Brady to learn where he got his numbers and did not hear back, but government numbers and experts show he’s wrong. 
There’s a general sense in the mental health community that disruptions in daily life, whether through social isolation or the loss of jobs, increases the risk of suicide. But Brady’s statement goes too far.
""There’s no way this can be true,"" said president of the American Association of Suicidology Dr. Jonathan Singer.
The most reliable statistics on suicides come from the National Center for Health Statistics and are from 2018. That year, there were 48,312 reported suicides, or an average of 4,026 every month.
Coronavirus deaths per month in the United States have been four times higher or more in recent months.
Going back to June — a month when deaths were falling — it was about 19,000. Now, it’s about 22,000 people per month.This chart shows the ebb and flow of deaths, measured as a seven-day rolling average.

The point is, no matter which recent months you take, COVID-19 has killed far more people than suicide has per month historically.
Is something happening different in 2020? Well, we don’t know; and neither does Brady.
Singer noted that preliminary numbers of reported suicides for 2019 show a slight decline since 2018 in the suicide rate. And Singer said there are no national numbers that are current.
""Reporters ask us what is the effect of the coronavirus on suicides, and we don’t know,"" Singer said. ""Because we don’t have the data.""
Some counties track suicides nearly daily, but Singer said there is no way to estimate national trends based on limited local information.
""For this to be right, you would need a rise in the suicide rate that is just impossible,"" Singer said.
Our ruling
Brady said that in the past two months, there have been more deaths from suicide than COVID-19.
There are no national numbers that back this up. COVID-19 has been killing people at a rate that is at least three times greater than suicide historically.
A leading researcher we reached said even in the absence of firm data, it is impossible for the suicide rate to have increased to surpass the COVID-19 death rate.

Many restaurants have sued their insurers after being denied business interruption insurance claims.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to reopen many businesses sparked a social media dress-down from a restaurant owner in the Atlanta area.
John Gianoulidis, owner of the Kafenio Greek Diner, said Kemp’s order will hurt small businesses.
""Kemp mandates restaurants reopen, whether I reopen dining rooms or not. I file for business interruption insurance, it does not go through since I am ‘allowed’ to operate full capacity,"" he wrote in an April 20 Facebook post that has been reshared thousands of times and drew national media attention.
The owner then described a series of problems he faces, including that he still has the pressures to pay rent and unemployment insurance.
""Guys, this is about screwing the working class and small business, not about helping us,"" he wrote.
A Facebook post that repeated the restaurant owner’s post without identifying him was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Exactly what happens for any business owner’s unemployment insurance and rent is difficult to fact-check, because those are based on private contractual arrangements. The full impact on restaurants won’t be known for months, if not longer.
But we can fact-check if Kemp mandated restaurants to reopen.
""I’ve had people take me to task for the usage of the word mandate,"" Gianoulidis told PolitiFact in an email.
Kemp’s order said that restaurants ""are hereby permitted to resume providing dine-in services"" as of April 27. The order includes 39 restrictions, including that restaurant workers must wear face masks, limit the number of patrons, and discontinue salad bars and buffets. 
In other words, restaurants are allowed to reopen, as long as they follow the rules, but they are not required to. Restaurants still have a choice. 
Still, the hardships faced by restaurant owners like Gianouidis are real. Georgia processed about 1.4 million unemployment claims from March 16 to April 25. Roughly 30% were from the food and hospitality sector, state labor data show.
Industry data show that as of May 6 around 31% of restaurants have reopened their dining rooms, said Karen Bremer, CEO of the Georgia Restaurant Association.

Whether it’s feasible for a restaurant to reopen under the 39 conditions depends on the size of the restaurant since seating is limited. The profit margin for a restaurant is between 4 and 6 percent, which means ""if your sales are off by 50%, you are paying to be open to take care of customers and employ people. You are burning cash to do it,"" Bremer said.
Restaurants face a series of challenges to reopen. Former restaurant workers collecting unemployment may not want to come back. It’s harder to buy meat amid shortages. It takes time to empty kitchens of expired food. 
Following Kemp’s decision, more than 120 Atlanta restaurants announced they would not reopen their dining rooms due to health and safety concerns, though many are offering takeout. Gianoulidis said Kafenio Avondale is open only for takeout/delivery while his College Park location has remained closed. 
Gianoulidis told PolitiFact that the cost and hassle of reopening the dining room following all of the protocols ""is not worth the risk or cost.""
""At least 80% of my customers now are not wearing masks and acting like it is all over,"" he told PolitiFact. ""It seems like since people are tired of being careful, most just gave up and are making believe there is nothing wrong.""
Gianoulidis said that his claim under business interruption insurance was denied. Multiple lawsuits have been filed by restaurants and other businesses or nonprofits against insurers that say claims for business interruption insurance policies were wrongly denied.
The insurance industry argues that policies were not designed to provide coverage against diseases such as COVID-19.
""Pandemics are not generally covered by business interruption,"" said Lauren Anderson, spokeswoman for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. ""Most standard policies list pandemics as an exclusion.""
Bremer, with the Georgia Restaurant Association, said that the majority of restaurant owners she has spoken to have had their claims denied for business interruption insurance. She said after previous viruses in past years, more policies added virus exclusions. She has told owners to file claims anyway.
But even claims under policies without exclusions for viruses are being denied, said lawyer John Houghtaling. In addition to his Georgia clients, Houghtaling is the lawyer for the Business Interruption Group, which was formed by some of the nation’s top chefs to help businesses that have been denied insurance claims. 
The insurance ""industry is taking a completely universal approach regardless of what the policy says,"" he told PolitiFact. 
Our ruling 
Gianoulidis wrote in a Facebook post that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ""mandates restaurants reopen.""
Kemp’s order didn’t force restaurants to reopen, but it allowed them to reopen as long as they follow 39 conditions. Many have determined that they will not open their dining rooms, due to health, safety or financial reasons.
The challenges and pain faced by restaurant owners is real, but the specific claim about Kemp’s order mandating restaurants to reopen is wrong.

If Your Time is short





There is no report saying this. A guest on an Alex Jones show speculated, based on data she said is forthcoming from a man who runs a medical billing company, that “we probably are going to see deaths over 500,000” from COVID-19 vaccines.


The CDC says it has not established a causal link between the COVID-19 vaccines and the deaths reported in its public data collection system.


The agency said there is a plausible causal link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare type of blood clot that has caused at least three deaths.





See the sources for this fact-check




An Instagram post with video from a show produced by Alex Jones, who runs a website known to spread fake news and conspiracy theories, includes this headline:
""Report: Vaccine related deaths may rival recorded COVID-19 deaths.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We found no credible report that says this. The headline alludes only to a claim made by a guest on a Jones show who speculated that — based on what she said is data forthcoming from a man who owns a medical billing company — ""we probably are going to see deaths over 500,000"" from COVID-19 vaccines.
That man says he analyzes numbers from a government database that collects and publishes unverified reports of adverse events that happen after vaccination, whether or not they’re known to be caused by the vaccine.
Health officials are investigating whether one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines is linked to a rare type of blood clot that can lead to death. But there is no conclusive evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines caused any of the deaths reported to that database, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Meanwhile, more than 596,000 COVID-19 deaths have been recorded in the U.S.
The headline in the Instagram post is the same text that appears in a June 4 tweet from Jones’ FreeWorldNews.TV account. The tweet includes video from part of a Jones show with a guest identified as Dr. Jane Ruby. Ruby, who is not a medical doctor, describes herself as a health economist and New Right political pundit with a doctorate in psychology. 
Saying she has ""breaking news,"" Ruby claimed that according to projections by Albert Benavides, ""we are facing well over 1 million side effects"" from the COVID-19 vaccines, ""and I’m waiting for him to calculate the numbers of deaths, because it’s going to be far more than the 5,000. We probably are going to see deaths over 500,000,"" which would be ""more deaths from this poison than we ever did from the actual COVID flu.""
Benavides has described himself as a California certified medical coder who has company that does medical billing services. He says he uses Excel spreadsheets to analyze data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a public data collection tool run by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration.

VAERS is designed so that any person can report an adverse event, and anyone can scour the reports. 
But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a dangerous breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere. For more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful. 
Here’s what the CDC says about VAERS and the roughly 5,000 deaths reported as adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines:
""More than 302 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through June 7, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 5,208 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. 
""However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.""
The CDC said May 12 that its investigation had identified 28 confirmed cases of these blood clots among the 8.7 million people who received the J&J vaccine, and three of those people died.
Our ruling
A widely shared Instagram post claimed: ""Report: Vaccine related deaths may rival recorded COVID-19 deaths.""
There is no credible report saying this. The claim came from a guest on a show produced by Alex Jones, who runs a website known to traffic in fake news and conspiracy theories.
The guest said she based her statement on data that soon would be produced by a California man who runs a medical billing company.

""Serious adverse effects possibly related to the vaccine were equally rare in both groups — vaccine and placebo — at about 0.5%,"" said Shiv Pillai, Harvard University’s Immunology Program director. ""There was no difference between the vaccine and placebo groups.""
The FDA briefing paper on the vaccine said it found no patterns to indicate that the vaccine caused these adverse outcomes.
We reached out to Lyons-Weiler and had not heard back by the time we published. We did find reference to 21% in a preliminary safety assessment of the Moderna vaccine in November that included a higher dose (250 micrograms) than is used today (100 micrograms). Only 14 people received two doses at the higher level, and three of them — 21% — had a systemic reaction that was judged to be serious. Systemic reactions include fever, headaches and muscle pains. In this study, they were not life-threatening. No one who got the 100 microgram dose had a serious reaction. That preliminary study said that ""no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified.""
An FDA panel recommended the vaccine for emergency use authorization.
Our ruling
A video shared on social media says that 21% of people getting the Moderna vaccine had a serious adverse reaction.

A video being passed around on Facebook Messenger claims that curing the novel coronavirus is as easy as drinking hot lemon juice.
The video, which a reader sent us on March 23, shows a series of stock images and videos with text underneath. A man with a British accent narrates.
""Use as much natural vitamin C as possible to strengthen the immune system,"" he says during the nearly 2-minute video. ""Slices of lemon in a cup of hot water can save your life. The hot lemon can kill the proliferation of this virus in our bodies!""
The narrator identifies himself as ""Jiao Shenme Minzi from China, a researcher at the Faculty of Medical Science, Zanjan University."" He goes on to say that ""warm lemons can have the same beneficial effects as medicines"" and their juice ""destroys the virus and cures the flu."" As evidence, the narrator credits a ""Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital.""

We’ve fact-checked several chain messages about the coronavirus, as well as bogus cures, on apps like iMessage, Snapchat and WhatsApp. So we looked into this one, too.
There is no evidence that drinking hot lemon juice kills COVID-19. Health officials have debunked the hoax, and a similar version has been shared in India and Italy.
There are a couple of things wrong with the video right off the bat.
First, the narrator claims to be based in China. But Zanjan University is in Iran. We found no evidence that the university has anyone on its medical faculty named Jiao Shenme Minzi, at least not as of September 2017, when its webpage says it was last updated. In fact, ""Jiao Shenme Minzi"" is one letter off from ""jiao shenme mingzi,"" a popular phonetic pronunciation of a phrase used in Chinese when asking someone for their name.

Dentists could individually choose how to operate when the order was in effect, but Wisconsin’s Department of Health Services recommends they follow CDC guidelines, which meant postponing elective procedures and visits.





See the sources for this fact-check




Amid the political upheaval over when and how and how fast to reopen Wisconsin, there was a point on May 11, 2020, when Gov Tony Evers relaxed his stay-at-home order to allow small retail establishments to reopen, so long as they limited shoppers to five or fewer.
The state Supreme Court later voted 4-3 to toss out Evers’ order entirely, saying his administration had to work with the GOP-controlled Legislature on any continued restrictions.
In the wake of Evers’ May 11 action, state Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, offered this tweet targeted at Evers:
@Gov Evers liquor stores are open, strip malls can have 5 customers, but dentists are non-essential?!
Is she right?
Were dentists considered non-essential under the safer-at-home order?
The short answer: No.
The Governor’s executive order
Let’s start with the order itself: Executive Order #28. 
Under Section 13, essential businesses include healthcare and public health operations. And, elsewhere within the order, dental offices are classified under healthcare and as public health operations. So, that order did not block dentists from seeing patients.
Meanwhile, an online map from the American Dental Association that tracks the extent to which dentists nationwide have been able to offer services shows the vast majority of states, including Wisconsin, allowing elective and emergency procedures. Of those, as of May 14, 2020, the map showed seven states allowing only emergency procedures. (No state had dentist offices closed entirely.)

Beyond that, Wisconsin is listed among only four states – including California, Rhode Island, and Delaware – that explicitly designated dentists as essential.
That said, the American Dental Association has recommended dentists remain open only for emergency procedures and postpone elective procedures. And the Wisconsin Dental Association follows ADA recommendations.
Similarly, the state Department of Health Services recommends dentists follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which include postponing elective procedures and non-emergency visits. 
So, on a practical level, many dentist offices held off on doing routine visits, such as cleanings and checkups. But that was due to their own choice, and consistent with guidelines from dental groups and health agencies. It was not forbidden under Evers’ order.
When asked for backup for the claim that dentists were deemed nonessential, Brandtjen didn’t cite the order itself.
Rather, in an email, she said Wisconsin dentists planned to start opening their offices in early May, but claimed the state Department of Health Services notified the Dentistry Examining Board that those who did could put their licenses in jeopardy.
Jennifer Garrett, communications director for the Department of Safety and Professional Services, said examining board members were advised by legal counsel May 6, 2020, that dentists should follow DHS guidelines, and could face penalties if they did not. 
But, as evidence, that is off point, particularly with such a narrow claim. 
As noted, the Evers order declared dentists essential — the opposite of what Brandtjen claimed.
Our rating
Brandtjen tweeted that under orders from Evers, dentists were classified as non-essential, and therefore had to remain closed.
But Evers’ order — unlike those from many other governors — explicitly declared dentists, like other health care workers, were essential. Thus, they were allowed to stay open, even if many chose to limit their offerings to emergency work.

Phil McGraw","Dr. Phil’s faulty point about the coronavirus and swimming pools




If Your Time is short





Phil “Dr. Phil” McGraw said there are 360,000 annual deaths in the U.S. from swimming pools. He’s since said he was citing the worldwide number and “misspoke.”


According to the CDC, there were 3,709 U.S. deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in 2017. Not all drowning deaths occur in swimming pools.


Drowning is not infectious or contagious, and deaths from it are spread over time.





See the sources for this fact-check




Celebrity psychologist Phil McGraw, known to his TV viewers as ""Dr. Phil,"" argued for reopening the economy on Fox News, rattling off a string of statistics about other causes of death that don’t require statewide shutdowns.
McGraw’s figures were not all accurate, however, and the comparisons he drew with the novel coronavirus weren't apples-to-apples.
""The fact of the matter is, we have people dying — 45,000 people a year die from automobile accidents, 480,000 from cigarettes, 360,000 a year from swimming pools,"" McGraw told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. ""But we don’t shut the country down for that.""

It didn’t take long for us to see where McGraw was right, and where he was wrong. And McGraw later said he offered ""bad examples.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette use is responsible for over 480,000 U.S. deaths per year, as McGraw said. The talk show host slightly overstated the number of deaths due to motor vehicle crashes, which the CDC reported as 40,231 in 2017.
But McGraw was wildly off when it came to deaths in swimming pools. 
The CDC tallied 3,709 deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in 2017, the most recent year with data available. Between 2005 and 2014, there were 3,536 unintentional deaths by drowning per year on average, plus an additional 332 from drowning in boat-related incidents. 
Not all drownings occur in swimming pools. According to the CDC, more than half of fatal and nonfatal drownings among people 15 years and older occur in natural water, such as lakes or the ocean. Drowning can also occur in bathtubs.
In an April 17 video on Facebook and Instagram Live, McGraw said he ""misspoke"" about drowning deaths. He said he was citing the worldwide number, which is 320,000 deaths per year, according to the World Health Organization. 
That’s still 40,000 fewer deaths than what he originally said. And the problems go beyond the number.
As we’ve reported, comparisons like McGraw’s can be misleading. The coronavirus, which had led to roughly 34,000 U.S. deaths as of April 17, is infectious and contagious. Drowning is not.

McGraw acknowledged that the comparison wasn’t perfect on Facebook and Instagram Live. A spokesperson for the ""Dr. Phil"" TV show pointed us to those remarks when we asked for a comment.
""Last night, I said we as a society have chosen to live with certain controllable deadly risks everyday — smoking, auto crashes, swimming,"" he said. ""And yes, I know that those are not contagious, so probably bad examples, probably bad examples.""

McGraw said there are ""360,000 (deaths) a year from swimming pools, but we don’t shut the country down for that.""
For one thing, that’s too many zeros. There were 3,709 U.S. deaths from accidental drowning or submersion in 2017. 
McGraw has since said he was citing the worldwide number for drowning deaths, and that his comparisons were ""probably bad examples."" The coronavirus is infectious and contagious, and the count of deaths from drowning is spread over a year.

At an event in Oshkosh, Wis., President Donald Trump said the country was ""doing great"" in the fight against the coronavirus.
""We're coming back and our numbers are better than almost all countries,"" Trump said Aug. 17.
When we asked the White House about the claim, the press office noted that by one measure, the United States is doing well.
Looking at the percentage of confirmed cases that lead to death, the United States has a rate that’s about half that in Europe and the rest of the world. 

But the source the White House cites, Oxford University’s Our World in Data project, says that ""During an outbreak of a pandemic the case fatality rate is a poor measure of the mortality risk of the disease."" 
There are other ways to track the suffering and reach of the coronavirus and by those, the United States is not doing well.
Measured against the size of the population, the United States has the 10th-highest death rate in the world. It’s doing better than the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Chile, but worse than France, Canada and Germany, to pick a few examples.

Factoring in population size, the United States has one of the highest rates globally of people who have tested positive — 16,430 per million residents, which is lower than Chile, but higher than any other large country. Put another way, the virus is known to have infected a higher fraction of the population in the U.S. than in many other places.

Trump often says that the United States finds more cases because it tests more than other nations. We’ve rated that claim False and Pants on Fire, depending on how he says it. Testing is a way to measure progress against the coronavirus, but the key indicator of progress is whether the percentage of tests that come back positive declines as more tests are done. 
With a positivity rate of about 7%, the United States ranks in the middle of the pack, doing better than countries such as Mexico and Argentina, but worse than just about every country in Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.
Our ruling
Trump said that the United States’ COVID-19 ""numbers are better than almost all countries."" The White House pointed to one number to back that up — the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases. But the source it cited said that wasn’t a good measure of the threat of the disease.
By other yardsticks, the United States is doing worse than many countries, including many major developed economies.
It has a higher death rate in relation to its population, the virus is known to have reached a larger share of the population, and the percentage of tests that come back positive is higher than in many other nations.

Pa. House Speaker Mike Turzai argued that children are largely protected from the ravages of the coronavirus because of their youth and would be safe if they return to school in the fall. 

 
A new study published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics found that roughly one in five children with serious cases of coronavirus had no underlying medical conditions. 

 
In New York City, 52 children sickened with the coronavirus have developed a serious condition called pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome.

Arguing that Pennsylvania should move quickly to reopen its economy even as coronavirus cases surge in some areas, the state House’s Republican leader said this weekend that reopening schools in the fall should be a top priority.
Not only do students deserve a chance to perform experiments in science labs and play instruments in recitals, House Speaker Mike Turzai said children are largely protected from the ravages of the virus because of their youth and would be safe if they go back to school.
""Guess what, they’re not at risk unless they have an underlying medical issue,"" said Turzai, whose comments came in a video he recorded from his Allegheny County home and later shared on social media.
We wondered whether school-age children are as safe as the house speaker says.
Turzai was on the right track when he said that children in poor health who contract the coronavirus are at risk of becoming seriously ill. And it’s true that children are far less susceptible than adults. But his claim that other children are totally safe is incorrect, according to a study published recently in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics.
Turzai declined to provide any evidence he relied on when he made this claim.
Testifying before the Senate this week, Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease doctor, warned Americans not to be ""cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.""
The study followed 48 children and young adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in the U.S. and Canada in March and April. Roughly one out of every five children studied had no underlying conditions. The others suffered from immune suppression, obesity, diabetes, seizures, or chronic lung disease.
In some cases, the impact of the virus was devastating.

The Rutgers University researchers who authored the study found that more than 20% of children experienced failure of two or more organ systems and almost 40% required a breathing tube and ventilator. At the end of the study period, a third of the children the researchers tracked were still hospitalized. Two of the children had died.
""Children without chronic illness are also at risk,"" the study authors wrote. ""Parents need to continue to take the virus seriously.""
Publication of the study came the same day New York City officials announced that a growing cluster of children sickened with the coronavirus have developed a serious condition called pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome.
So far, at least 52 children have been diagnosed with the syndrome, which causes high fever and swelling and may cause heart and kidney failure. Most are between the ages of 5 and 9. New York City officials said symptoms of the syndrome vary from patient to patient but include fever, rash, bright red lips, swollen hands and feet and abdominal pain. One five-year-old has died.
""This was not something that the health care community saw on their radar,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday at his daily coronavirus briefing. ""Then in the last week or two, suddenly, we’re seeing something that’s very troubling.""  
In other parts of New York state, 21 additional children with coronavirus symptoms have become seriously ill. 
It’s unclear whether any of the children sickened by pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome had underlying medical conditions. 
Half of the children in New York City who were diagnosed with the syndrome tested positive for COVID-19, meaning their bodies are battling an active infection and the syndrome simultaneously. Almost  two dozen other children with the syndrome tested positive for antibodies against the disease, meaning they had previously contracted the virus and recovered before they developed symptoms of the syndrome.
It’s not known how many Pennsylvania children may have developed pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome. According to data from the state Department of Health, fewer than 3% of the almost 60,000 known coronavirus cases across the state are among children and teenagers.

Hundreds of Facebook users have shared a post that says that Kamala Harris, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, wants to put an end to beef production.
The post shows a picture of meat and claims that the California senator worked with Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to go after animal agriculture. 
""Kamala Harris wants to eliminate this right here. If you raise beef or eat beef, you can't vote (for) the Democratic Party this election. She has worked with Cory Booker on eliminating animal agriculture and is on record starting that meat is killing the planet. That shows her ignorance,"" the post says.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Despite what this post alleges, Harris hasn’t said she wants to eliminate beef. 
In July, Booker, who is a vegan, introduced legislation to protect workers at meatpacking plants, which became deadly hot spots amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill would suspend waivers and rules that permit companies to ramp up production, and Harris was one of its cosponsors.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in July that 16,233 COVID-19 cases in 239 meat and poultry processing facilities were reported in 23 states across the country. 
It’s not just Facebook users who are weighing in on Harris’ policy recommendations for meat consumption and production.

President Donald Trump’s YouTube account recently shared a video clip from Harris at a CNN climate change town hall during the Democratic primaries in September 2019. At an August 2020 speech in Iowa, Vice President Mike Pence criticized her town hall remarks and said, ""We’re not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America’s meat.""
But Pence’s statements were misleading. Here’s what Harris said at the town hall.
""As a nation, we actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating,"" Harris said in response to a question at the CNN town hall.
The agriculture sector contributed 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Cattle produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as part of their digestive process, and the management of manure can also add to emissions. 
Harris added that the government should create incentives and change dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat, as opposed to banning it altogether. 
""I love cheeseburgers from time to time,"" Harris said.

The American Medical Association never took back its March statement concerning hydroxychloroquine. The group tweeted that Rush Limbaugh’s claim is wrong.


The AMA considered a resolution to rescind a previous statement on the drug when the group’s policymaking body met in November. But it ultimately rejected the resolution.


The website Limbaugh cited has corrected its story.

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh falsely claimed that the American Medical Association rescinded a previous statement and came out in support of hydroxychloroquine, the drug pushed by President Donald Trump for months as a potential treatment for COVID-19.
""Now all of a sudden the AMA (said) — although very quietly — that hydroxychloroquine is okay,"" Limbaugh said Dec. 15, telling his millions of listeners that the group’s past statements were meant to hurt Trump. ""It’s perfectly fine. Go ahead and use it if you want. It can be helpful.""
Limbaugh read from an article in the Published Reporter, a website based in South Florida. The website wrote that the AMA ""rescinded"" a statement related to hydroxychloroquine. 
Limbaugh accused the AMA of ""knowingly lying about hydroxychloroquine."" But as the Poynter Institute reported, the AMA never retracted its statement on the drug. The Published Reporter and other websites that spread similar claims have walked back their reports, and the AMA addressed the matter on Twitter.
""In March, AMA urged caution about prescribing hydroxychloroquine off-label to treat #COVID19,"" the AMA wrote, with a link to Poynter’s Covering COVID-19 newsletter by Al Tompkins. ""Our position remains unchanged. Evidence-based #science & practice must guide these determinations.""

Limbaugh did not respond to a request for comment. 
The AMA’s March 25 statement, issued jointly with pharmacists’ groups and updated in April, signaled opposition to doctors prescribing hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment or preventative measure, and to facilities ordering the drug in excessive amounts. 
The statement cautioned that ""no medication has been FDA-approved for use in COVID-19 patients"" and warned of supply-chain disruptions for patients who rely on hydroxychloroquine for other chronic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. 
The statement also said ""novel off-label use of FDA-approved medications is a matter for the physician’s or other prescriber’s professional judgment."" It encouraged ""patient-centered care decisions"" but said ""evidence-based science and practice must guide these determinations.""
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June revoked its emergency use authorization for use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 therapy. The agency later cautioned against the drug’s use for the virus outside of the hospital setting after a review of safety issues. There is little sign that hydroxychloroquine is effective for coronavirus patients.
A resolution submitted ahead of a November meeting of the AMA’s policymaking body proposed that the group retract the March statement. The resolution called for an updated statement ""notifying patients that further studies are ongoing"" and supporting physicians’ use of judgment to prescribe the drug off-label to patients with early COVID-19 symptoms.
The resolution was not adopted, however. The vote against the measure followed ""fierce opposition,"" MedPage Today reported.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







While health experts recommend drinking water regularly to stay healthy, there is no evidence that sipping some every 15 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. 
The primary way the virus spreads is through close contact with infected people and respiratory droplets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When someone with the coronavirus coughs or sneezes, their germs land on surfaces around them. The virus then infects people who touch those surfaces and then their eyes, nose and mouth.
So to prevent contracting the coronavirus, the CDC advises people to avoid touching their face as much as possible. Other ways to prevent infection include washing your hands with soap and water, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and regularly sanitizing the surfaces in your home or at your workstation. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus.
In a tweet published Feb. 7, the World Health Organization in the Philippines said it does not advise people to drink water as a way to avoid coronavirus infection.

Donald Trump","Trump’s false claim that children are ‘almost immune’ to COVID-19




If Your Time is short





Children represent about 7.3% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S and less than 0.1% of deaths, according to the CDC.


Many children were not exposed to the virus as much as adults because schools shut down nationwide in March.


Research in other countries that reopened schools shows children can catch COVID-19.





See the sources for this fact-check




As millions of parents across the United States agonize over whether their children should return to school, President Donald Trump has continued to downplay the chances that children will catch COVID-19.
""This thing is going away, it will go away like things go away. My view is that schools should be open,"" Trump said on Fox and Friends Aug. 5.  ""If you look at children, children are almost, I would almost say definitely, but almost immune from this disease. So few. Hard to believe. I don’t know how you feel about it but they have much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this. They don’t have a problem.""
By the evening, both Facebook and Twitter took action against Trump for his statements about immunity and children which the social media companies said were violations of their policies against COVID-19 misinformation. Facebook took down a post of the Fox video clip on Trump’s official account, with a spokesperson saying it contained false information that violated its standards around harmful COVID-19 misinformation. Twitter, meanwhile, required a Team Trump campaign account to remove the tweet. It appeared that Trump had tweeted the video from his own Twitter account but the video link was dead.
Trump is using the term ""immune"" to suggest that children won’t get sick. It’s clear that children do get infected, although symptoms are often not as serious as those for older adults. But he’s wrong to state that children are ""almost immune.""
""Children as a group are clearly less impacted by this virus than adults, but to say they are almost immune does not provide a truthful message,"" said University of South Florida public health professor Dr. Marissa J. Levine.
Children account for about 7% of U.S. COVID-19 cases
The data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that children account for about 7.3% of cases. Children account for less than 1% of deaths.  
But that data covers a time period when millions of children stayed home and did their classes online. That means we don’t yet know what will happen when children return to school buildings. 
Although it is early in the school year, there have already been some students who tested positive including in Mississippi and Indiana. It’s unclear how many students will attend in person nationwide, although the majority of the largest school districts have chosen virtual learning. 
Mark Schleiss, a University of Minnesota professor of pediatrics, said Trump is wrong on two counts: his statement about immunity and his suggestion that children are less likely to catch the germ than adults.
""Immunity means that your immune system has some sense of history with having encountered the germ before, and hence can fight it off,"" he said. ""Well, what's the biological plausibility that any person would have immunity to a virus that didn't even exist until a few months ago? And how could you have immunity to it if you never even encountered it before? So, as a pediatrician, immunologist and vaccine researcher, the statement is absurd, and unequivocally incorrect.""
Schleiss pointed to a research letter published in The Journal of the American Medical Association by Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. Researchers examined 145 cases of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and found children younger than 5 years have much higher levels of genetic material for the virus in their noses compared to older children and adults. Authors concluded that young children can potentially be important drivers of the virus spread, which causes concern for educators.
Experts also pointed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 at an overnight camp in Georgia. Test results were available for 344 (58%) attendees; among these, 260 (76%) were positive. While children are in closer proximity to each other at overnight camp than a school, experts say it still serves as a warning about reopening schools. 
""That is not what we would expect of a group who were ‘almost immune,’"" Levine said.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist at University of California, Irvine, said Trump has a point in that children get sick at low rates, but his overall statement is misleading. The main fear about reopening schools is how it will spread to teachers and parents.
""The idea schools can open and everything is going to be hunky dory, sort of a summary of the president’s intended message, that is misleading,"" Noymer said. ""I am worried kids can catalyze the pandemic even worse than it already is in terms of an engine of generating infection of adults.""
The White House pointed to statements by CDC director Robert Redfield in favor of reopening schools and his agency’s guidance on schools, but those statements didn’t address immunity. The White House also pointed to statements by Dr. Scott Atlas that ""children under 18 have virtually zero risk of death from this"" or serious illness. Atlas is a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and is the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center.
Research from other countries
Studies about school children and COVID-19 are limited, but research from other countries indicates that high schoolers who come in contact with the disease respond more like adults, while elementary children present a lower risk of spread. 
A recent study out of South Korea looked at more than 1,200 cases of people with COVID-19. It found that the rate of infection was three times higher for children 10 to 19 years old than for children under 10.
After schools reopened in Israel in late May, outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close, the New York Times found.
""Opening schools, especially for children above the age of 10, in crowded settings, can facilitate transmission,"" Hagai Levine, an epidemiology professor at Hebrew University-Hadassah told PolitiFact. ""Education is a must. So the lesson from Israel is to prepare and look for careful, gradual opening. If possible, learn outdoors.""
In its guidelines for schools, the CDC said infection seems to vary by age, with students 10 to 17 being more likely to catch the disease than those under 10.
Some European countries did have success in reopening schools, but most didn’t reopen school amid a spike of outbreaks like ones in some states in the U.S.
Experts have warned that we can’t assume the U.S. experience this fall will mirror that of some other countries.
""We may learn much more about COVID-19 in children as schools open,"" Levine said. ""That is part of the unknown for which I would be hesitant to conclude with blanket statements about pediatric immunity to COVID-19.""
Our ruling
Trump said ""children are almost immune from this disease.""
The White House cited a statement by the CDC director in support of schools reopening and a doctor who noted that kids rarely get severe cases, but that doesn’t mean that children are immune to COVID-19. It’s wrong to state that children are ""almost immune"" as we have seen cases spread at an overnight camp in the U.S. and at some schools, including in Israel.

National Republican Congressional Committee","Lucy McBath didn’t vote to release murderers, rapists from prison




If Your Time is short



• McBath voted for a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package, one portion of which required federal prisons to release inmates who were at the end of their sentences or deemed vulnerable to COVID-19. The bill includes language specifically barring the release of prisoners who pose a risk of violence. 
• The bill has stalled in the Senate and hasn’t been enacted, so it’s inaccurate to imply that it led to increased crime rates. ​



See the sources for this fact-check




An attack ad against  Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., accuses her of voting to release murderers and rapists onto the streets of Georgia. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee ad supports Republican Karen Handel, who lost her spot in the House to McBath in 2018. The 6th District rematch is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. 
In the ad, the camera follows a woman jogging in a park, with heavy breathing in the background audio. A narrator says, ""We moved here for peace of mind, safety, but now crime has gotten out of control, and Lucy McBath voted to release criminals from prison. Murderers, rapists."" 
Handel is running a campaign reminiscent of President Donald Trump’s push for ""law and order,"" and she previously released an ad that accused McBath of being soft on crime and supportive of violent protesters, which we rated False. 
The NRCC ad is consistent with this attack line. But we found that it leaves out important context and gives a misleading impression. 
The ad’s fine print cites McBath’s vote for H.R. 6800, a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill that did not become law. McBath voted with other House Democrats in favor of the measure, one part of which mandated the release of prisoners vulnerable to COVID-19. However, another provision in the bill explicitly bars the release of prisoners deemed to be a risk for violence. 
McBath never voted to release violent criminals
H.R. 6800, known as the HEROES Act, is a proposed bill meant to respond to various aspects of the COVID-19 crisis. The bill, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate, would provide $3.4 trillion of coronavirus relief, including assistance to state and local governments and hazard pay for frontline health care workers.
The part that’s relevant to the NRCC’s claims come from a 44-page portion of the 1,800-page bill. This section was written to address the fact that prison inmates have been among those hardest hit by the pandemic. It requires the Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshal Service to place into home confinement prisoners who are within a year of being released, juveniles, pregnant, over 50 years old or have health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, HIV, or cancer.
The bill specifically bars the release of inmates deemed to be a risk for violence. It does not define that criteria.

Sen. Raphael Warnock “voted for welfare for politicians plan. Up to $25 million of government money for Warnock’s own political campaign.”












By Amy Sherman • June 25, 2021







Here’s language directly from the bill:
The Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshal Service ""may not place in community supervision any individual if the court determines, after a hearing and the attorney for the Government shows by clear and convincing evidence based on individualized facts, that detention is necessary because the individual’s release will pose a specific and substantial risk that the individual will cause bodily injury or use violent force against the person of another."" 
The NRCC didn’t respond to our request for comment. However, a document posted on its website notes that ""the vague language of H.R. 6800 does not rule out the release of violent prisoners."" 
By raising the issue of rising crime in Georgia and referencing McBath’s vote for the HEROES Act in a single breath, the ad seems to be implying that the legislation has contributed to rising crime in McBath’s district. 
However, the HEROES Act hasn’t been enacted, so it can’t be linked to any crime trend. 
In addition, the ad leaves out the important context that the bill doesn’t call for inmates to be released into the general public. 
""People are not being sent home from jail,"" said Kanya Bennett, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, summarizing the bill’s intent. ""They’re being sent to home confinement and still under the supervision of the Bureau of Prisons. That’s a very important distinction to make."" 
Our ruling
A campaign ad claims that ""Lucy McBath voted to release criminals from prison. Murderers, rapists."" 
McBath voted for a coronavirus relief package that would have allowed for the home confinement of some prisoners with health issues or near the end of their sentence. That bill does not rule out murderers and rapists explicitly, but it says prisoners deemed to be a risk for violence are ineligible for home confinement.

Coronavirus







Candace Owens","COVID-19 skeptics say there’s an overcount. Doctors in the field say the opposite




If Your Time is short





Patients who test positive for the coronavirus are likely being included in nationwide death counts.


But doctors say that’s actually an undercount because of a lack of available testing, among other factors.


Coronavirus is more difficult for people with pre-existing heart and lung problems, which could lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest.





See the sources for this fact-check




On the day that doctors and nurses in New York City treated over 1,500 new COVID-19 patients, conservative pundit Candace Owens claimed that deaths from the pandemic coronavirus have been inflated.
""Apparently, doctors and nurses around the world are wondering why no one is dying from heart attacks or strokes any more, Owens tweeted April 6. ""Flu and pneumonia deaths also went off a cliff. Turns out everyone is only dying of coronavirus now. Gee, I wonder why.""
 
An exaggerated death count is a persistent talking point. On April 4, Owens tweeted ""State departments of Public Health are reporting the number of deaths BEFORE the medical examiners have even concluded the cause of death,"" she said. ""There would be no legitimate way to report how many people die daily."" 
Are Owens’ claims correct? We asked her for evidence but did not hear back. What we found is that her statement is at odds with doctors, who say the data, in fact, reflects an undercount.
Here’s why the details of death reporting back up the doctors more than the pundits.
Complicating factors aren’t so complicated
Owens is wrong that only medical examiners determine a person’s cause of death. Formal death certificates start with the attending doctor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells physicians to list the immediate cause of death, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest, and then proceed to the underlying disease that caused the heart or breathing to stop.
The underlying cause should be ""the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death.""
If a person showed up in the emergency room with COVID-19 symptoms and a heart attack, there could be a judgement call as to what goes in as the underlying cause. But Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there would be strong argument to note the key role of COVID-19.
""I would put COVID-19 as the primary cause,"" Plescia said. ""Because most likely, the heart attack was caused by the fever or a difficulty in breathing.""
There’s no question that the virus lands harder on people with pre-existing heart and lung problems.
""If those individuals are positive for COVID-19 and have symptoms, COVID-19 is typically being listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, with their other diseases listed as contributory,"" said Dr. Sally Aiken, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners.
Aiken added, ""it is not a conspiracy, or any different than what occurs during non-COVID-19 times.""
The CDC said in a statement that if it works with death certificate data, it will add a death to the COVID-19 tally regardless on which line the disease is listed.
Death certificates and COVID-19 reports are different
It’s important to note that death certificates are not the only — or even primary way — the states report coronavirus deaths. 
New York, which to date accounts for over 40% of deaths nationwide, does not use death certificate data for reporting COVID-19 fatalities. When a person with the virus dies, hospitals or nursing homes tell their local health officials who then notify the state health department, which in turn sends a report to Washington.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







Providers in New York use this form to record the death, and unlike a full death certificate, it provides just one place to note the disease.

This quick reporting form lacks the details that go into a death certificate. Like seasonal flu, COVID-19 is what is known as a nationally notifiable disease. Heart attacks and strokes fall into the larger group of diseases that are not tracked in real time. The system to gather COVID-19 data is designed to help public health officials track what is happening as quickly as possible.
Death certificates are processed at a slower pace.  
Why doctors say we’re likely undercounting, not overcounting deaths
There are several reasons COVID-19 victims might not make it into the quick reporting system.
""Doctors won't record a death until they are certain,"" Plescia said. ""And with the high volume of cases, they may not be reporting because they move on to other things.""
Plescia added that if a person dies on the way to the hospital, or very soon after, they won’t be tested for the virus.
""There’s nothing any more you can do for them,"" he said.
Aiken said if the person had no symptoms of the coronavirus, her department wouldn’t test them.
""These decedents are not being tested for COVID-19 as a matter of course,"" Aiken said.
Given the scarcity of tests, Aiken said, that’s generally true across the country. 
Plescia said, ""if there’s any error, it’s in under-reporting.""
Aiken echoed the point, and said it applies to death certificates as well.
""COVID-19 deaths will likely be under-reported on death certificates and not over-reported,"" Aiken said. ""This will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount.""
Our ruling
Owens said that ""everyone is dying of coronavirus now."" Her post reflects a misunderstanding of how COVID-19 interacts with other health conditions and how deaths are reported. 
The physicians we reached said it’s important to track when COVID-19 triggers a pre-existing heart or lung condition. To meet the need for immediate data, New York sends the CDC summaries of COVID-19 deaths, and not the full death certificates. 
People familiar with the tracking system say some victims go uncounted. They told us that the limited supply of testing, the pace of work at hospitals and deaths that take place outside any medical facility point to an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths, not an overreporting.

Most cases of the 2019 coronavirus disease have been mild, but it’s been lethal for some people.

And yet, claims likening coronavirus to the common cold persist, including in a Facebook post that says:
""The coronavirus: The Democrats are using it to promote fear. The Chinese are using it to control protestors. And all along it’s simply the common cold.""
Gesundheit, but we've been here before. The 2019 coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that includes the common cold, but the two are not the same. This Facebook post is wrong.

Posts pointing fingers
Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus disease, officially known as COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, in December, we’ve fact-checked several false claims that aim to downplay the severity of the virus and to blame the media, politicians or pharmaceutical companies for drawing attention to it.   
One such claim came from conservative radio talk show host and recent Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh, who said the coronavirus is the common cold.
Our rating was False.

There are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of those viruses, which are named for their crown-like structure, can cause colds.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Most strains of the coronavirus are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003.
According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012. 
All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath — similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization.
A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory-tract illnesses, like the common cold.""
But the same fact sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said.
The majority of viruses that cause the common cold are rhinoviruses, according to the CDC. Cases range from mild to moderate in severity, and many adults get two or three colds per year. Children are more likely to get them.
In contrast, cases of the coronavirus have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. Older people and those with preexisting medical conditions are more likely to suffer complications from COVID-19, while children are not. The virus has an estimated 3.4% mortality rate.
In short, the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December 2019. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold.

Facebook posts","Facebook posts falsely claim Dr. Fauci has millions invested in a coronavirus vaccine




If Your Time is short





There is no evidence that Dr. Anthony Fauci is personally financially invested in a coronavirus vaccine.


The Gates Foundation has pledged up to $60 million for COVID-19 vaccine development, not $100 million, as the post says. Some of that will go to a group that’s manufacturing a potential vaccine developed by NIAID scientists, but not the agency itself.


While some studies have found that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could help alleviate coronavirus symptoms, other studies have found the drugs have no discernible effect.





See the sources for this fact-check




The country’s top infectious disease expert is discouraging the use of a potential COVID-19 treatment because he could earn millions of dollars from a vaccine, at least, that’s according to a popular Facebook claim.
One post published by an anti-vaccine page on April 12 says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), ""stands to lose 100 million dollars"" on a coronavirus vaccine from Bill Gates because he invested in it.
""If everyone can be healed with the Malaria drug and a Z pack, there will be no need for the vaccine if we could use drugs already on the market that helps heal 98 percent of the cornovirus (sic) patients,"" reads the image. ""That’s why he’s been so hesitant to put his seal of approval on this form of treatment that has shown to drastically improve hundreds of people’s symptoms.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
As a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, Fauci has tempered expectations for the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. The drugs, which are used to treat conditions like malaria and lupus, respectively, have shown some promise in alleviating coronavirus symptoms, but the research is not conclusive.
PolitiFact has seen a lot of misinformation about public officials’ financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. Fauci has become a popular target for coronavirus disinformation, so we wanted to check out this post, too.
The Facebook post draws a false connection between Gates’ philanthropy and Fauci’s public remarks about hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence that Fauci is personally financially invested in a coronavirus vaccine, and scientists still don’t know if hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.
Gates Foundation supports coronavirus research
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is indirectly supporting the NIAID by funding a group that is helping the agency develop a potential coronavirus vaccine. But there is no evidence that Fauci himself stands to profit.
The Gates Foundation said in a Feb. 5 statement that it is investing up to $100 million for ""the global response to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" That includes efforts aimed at improving detection and treatment of the virus in addition to vaccine development.
""The foundation will commit up to $60 million to accelerate the discovery, development and testing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for 2019-nCoV (the formal name for the coronavirus),"" the statement reads. 
While the Gates Foundation has supported the NIAID in the past, the philanthropy told PolitiFact in an email that it does not provide funding to the agency now, even though NIAID is currently developing a COVID-19 vaccine.
During his March 11 testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Fauci said it could take a year and a half to roll out a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine. There are 70 vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization — three of which are in clinical trials.

The first trial began in mid-March. The potential vaccine was developed by NIAID scientists in partnership with pharmaceutical company Moderna, Inc. A search of the Securities Exchange Commission’s database, which contains information on publicly traded companies, turned up no documents linking Fauci directly to Moderna.
According to a statement from the National Institutes of Health, which houses the NIAID, manufacturing for the potential vaccine was supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation that funds vaccine research. The Gates Foundation said in its February release that it will allocate some of its research and development funding to the coalition. 
So Gates' money is indirectly going toward the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine created by NIAID scientists, but not to the agency itself. And there is no publicly available evidence that Fauci personally stands to profit from a vaccine.
Hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment
The Facebook post claims that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine heal ""98% of coronavirus patients"" and have improved ""hundreds of people’s symptoms."" There is no evidence to back that up.
With more than 50 studies in the works, there is still much scientists don’t know about how hydroxychloroquine affects the coronavirus. But four studies — two from France and two from China — have come to conflicting conclusions.
One study of 62 patients in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the pandemic, found that those who were issued hydroxychloroquine saw their body temperature and cough go down faster than the control group. But a separate group of doctors in Shanghai found that the drug had no discernible effect on a group of 30 patients over the course of a week.
RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know
Two studies in France had similarly opposing conclusions. One hospital in Marseilles gave 80 COVID-19 patients a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, an antibiotic. After five days, 95% of the patients tested negative for the coronavirus. But a similar hospital study in Paris found no marked improvement in 10 patients.
Bottom line: We still don’t know whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is effective at improving COVID-19 symptoms. 
That uncertainty, as well as the drugs’ adverse heart effects and the potential for doctors to stockpile it, is why public health officials have urged caution. There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, although the agency has issued an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in hospitals.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims Fauci has downplayed the potential use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients because he stands to lose $100 million on a Gates-funded vaccine.
There are 70 potential COVID-19 vaccines in development, one of which was created by NIAID scientists in partnership with Moderna, Inc. That vaccine is being manufactured by an organization that the Gates Foundation supports, but there’s no evidence that NIAID or Fauci will directly profit from that support. And the Gates Foundation has pledged up to $60 million for vaccine development, not $100 million, as the post says.
Some studies have found that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could help treat coronavirus patients, but others have found no effect at all. Public health officials have urged caution due to the uncertainty and the adverse side effects of the drugs.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







First, let’s take a closer look at the portal, which is called World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS).
The World Bank maintains the portal in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The website offers a compilation of trade and tariff data from different UN divisions and other international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization. It allows users to search for things like the top products exported by certain countries.
The table shown in the Facebook post lists the top exporters of ""instruments used in clinical laboratories for in vitro diagnosis"" and ""colorimetric end tidal CO2 detectors,"" which is the scientific name for a carbon dioxide detector. CO2 detectors help doctors monitor intubated patients. 
Both of those things existed prior to the coronavirus pandemic. So why was the table previously billed as a list of ""COVID-19 Diagnostic Test"" exporters? 
It has to do with guidance from the World Health Organization and a related database.
In April, the WHO and the World Customs Organization classified CO2 detectors and diagnostic testing equipment, along with hand sanitizer and surgical masks, as critical to fighting COVID-19. Both received the same WCO code — ""902780"" in the Facebook post. COVID-19 test kits were assigned two different codes.
The WHO gave some products less technical, coronavirus-related descriptions to make them easier to track. But the broad classification, which was applied to some testing equipment that predated COVID-19, carried over to a WITS database of products related to the virus.
RELATED: No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths
""The WITS team created a special database using the WCO list (along with the new WHO/WCO labels/descriptions),"" the World Bank said in a Sept. 8 statement. ""The goal was to put information about key COVID-related medical supplies in one easy-to-find place.""
That resulted in what many Facebook users are confused about: a list of export data about diagnostic testing instruments that appear to predate the coronavirus. The World Bank has since revised the title of the table to read: ""Medical Diagnostic Test instruments and apparatus.""
""In light of misinterpretations that have occurred in recent days, the labeling in the WITS site has been updated to reflect the reality: COVID-19 tests did not exist before 2020,"" the organization said in its statement.

Jerome R. Corsi","Conspiracy theorist spreads false claim about Fauci, patents and COVID-19




If Your Time is short





Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and conspiracy theorist, wrote on his blog that Dr. Anthony Fauci’s name appears on four patents for a protein linked to the novel coronavirus.


Three of the patents Corsi cited are active. They deal with a potential treatment for HIV and are owned by the Department of Health and Human Services.


There is no credible evidence that COVID-19 is related to HIV or was created in a lab. The coronavirus’ genetic makeup precludes the possibility that it was man-made.





See the sources for this fact-check




A conservative author who previously promoted the Obama birth certificate conspiracy is now publishing false claims about Dr. Anthony Fauci’s connection to the coronavirus pandemic.
An April 28 article published on Jerome Corsi’s blog alleges that Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, owns some intellectual property tied to the novel coronavirus. It also floats the debunked idea that the virus was ""laboratory-created, possibly as a bioweapon.""
""Why does Dr. Anthony Fauci’s name appear on 4 U.S. patents for a key glycoprotein that appears to have been inserted into a SARS virus chassis to create the current COVID-19 epidemic?"" Corsi wrote.
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 

(Screenshot from Corsi Nation)
Corsi is a conservative author and conspiracy theorist. He has made baseless allegations about former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate and spread misinformation related to QAnon, a broad right-wing conspiracy theory. As a friend of Roger Stone, a former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump, Corsi was part of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into 2016 election meddling.
Since the pandemic began, we’ve fact-checked several false claims about Fauci’s connection to the coronavirus. Corsi’s article is similar to a claim made in ""Plandemic,"" a viral documentary that makes a slew of wrong allegations about Fauci, vaccines and COVID-19. So we wanted to look into this article, too.
Corsi uses a discredited research article to draw an unwarranted connection between a patent family for a potential HIV treatment and the novel coronavirus. His article feeds into the debunked conspiracy theory that the virus was created in a lab.
HHS owns patents for potential HIV treatment
Corsi lists four patents in his article. They all have to do with a potential HIV treatment patented by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The patents, three of which are active, all deal with a potential method for preventing HIV infection. That method includes ""a therapeutically effective amount of an agent that interferes with the interaction of gpl20 and α4 integrin ... thereby treating the HIV infection.""
In plain English: the potential treatment aims to impede a chemical interaction between HIV and human cells that can lead to transmission of the virus. It was based on a 2008 study conducted by NIAID scientists.
Fauci is listed as an inventor on the patents alongside a few other authors of the 2008 study. But the assignee — the entity that owns the patents — is HHS.

We reached out to the NIAID for more context, but we haven’t heard back.
No evidence novel coronavirus was manipulated
Corsi is using a withdrawn article and a debunked conspiracy theory to link the HHS patents to the coronavirus pandemic.
In his article, Corsi mentions a Jan. 31 piece published by a group of Indian scientists on bioRxiv, a repository of preprint research papers. The article — which was not peer-reviewed and was later withdrawn — found a connection between a protein present in HIV and the novel coronavirus.
The authors wrote that ""amino acid residues"" in the coronavirus were similar to gpl20, the HIV protein that NIAID scientists studied in 2008. The protein is mentioned in the HHS patents.
But the authors withdrew their findings after other scientists criticized them as circumstantial and adding fuel to an unfounded conspiracy theory that the novel coronavirus was created in a lab. 
RELATED: What we know about the source of the coronavirus pandemic
Researchers have concluded that the genetic structure of the novel coronavirus rules out the possibility of laboratory manipulation. 
A Nature article published March 17 says the genetic makeup of the coronavirus, documented by researchers from several public health organizations, does not indicate it was altered. Instead, scientists have two plausible explanations for the origin of the virus: natural selection in an animal host, or natural selection in humans after the virus jumped from animals.
""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" the article reads.
We contacted Corsi by email but haven’t gotten a response.
Our ruling
Corsi’s article claims that Fauci’s name appears on four patents for a protein that was used to create the novel coronavirus. That’s wrong.
Three of the patents that Corsi identified are active and owned by the Department of Health and Human Services. But they are unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic. They deal with a potential treatment for HIV that NIAID researchers studied in 2008. Fauci is listed as an author on that study and as one of the inventors on the patents.
There is no credible evidence that COVID-19 is related to HIV or was created in a lab. The coronavirus’ genetic makeup precludes the possibility that it was man-made. And Fauci is helping lead the U.S. response to the pandemic.

There is no historical or scientific evidence for the claim that masks cause pneumonia, experts said.

In an attempt to cast masks as more harmful than helpful, posts online are pointing to research on the 1918 influenza pandemic. They claim that masks inadvertently caused the majority of the deaths, and that the government’s leading epidemiologist, Dr. Anthony Fauci — who has urged mask wearing to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus — was the one who wrote about the link. 
The post features a screenshot of a tweet that says, ""The unmasked buried the masked in the ‘Spanish flu.’ What did the people in #masks die from? Bacterial pneumonia. Who knew this and wrote about it in 2008? Dr. Anthony Fauci.""
A caption from one user who shared the post on Facebook reads, ""Dr Fauci wrote a paper regarding the Spanish Flu and stated that the majority of deaths in 1918-1919 was because of bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks.""

A 2008 study, co-authored by Fauci, found that most of the deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic were not caused by the virus acting alone, but came when victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following infection.
Researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci heads, published their report in October 2008 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
""The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs,"" a summary of the report said.
""In essence"" Fauci is quoted in the report as saying, ""the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The report doesn’t blame masks.
And yet, opponents of masks, who have circulated false claims that link them to bacterial or fungal infections, interpreted the study to mean that long-term mask wearing caused the deadly pneumonias. That is not the case. Secondary bacterial pneumonias have long been associated with severe influenza in human and animal studies.
Experts told us that historians and other researchers have assumed for decades that a significant portion of the 1918-19 pandemic deaths were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia infections, and more recent studies have supported this thesis. In fact, when discussing the 1918-19 pandemic death toll, researchers have consistently used the term ""P&I deaths,"" that is, deaths attributed to both pneumonia and influenza. 
J. Alexander Navarro, assistant director at the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and co-editor in chief of the ""American Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919"" digital encyclopedia, called the claim that masks caused bacterial pneumonia ""absolutely preposterous.""
""They don’t, and no infectious disease expert of Dr. Fauci’s caliber would ever claim that,"" Navarro told PolitiFact. ""If masks did cause pneumonia, we’d see major pneumonia cases developing in clinicians who wear masks for long periods of the day, or even in tradespeople and others who work in dusty conditions and who routinely wear respirators to help prevent dust particles from entering their respiratory tracts. Mask wearing is routine in many Asian countries, even before the COVID pandemic, and there are no widespread pneumonia outbreaks as a result."" 
Our ruling
Posts online claim Fauci wrote a 2008 study blaming the majority of deaths in the 1918-19 influenza pandemic on bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks.
Fauci never wrote that. In the paper he co-authored, researchers found that secondary bacterial pneumonia caused a majority of deaths in the pandemic. This is a well-documented side effect of severe influenza infections, and has nothing to do with masks.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, airline stocks have plummeted. Companies like Delta, American and United have cut or reduced flights. Photos show empty airport terminals around the world.
On March 13, Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt took those signs to mean that now is a great time to take a trip.
""It’s actually the safest time to fly,"" she said during the Fox News morning show. ""Everyone I know that’s flying right now, terminals are pretty much dead — ghost towns.""
As of March 12, more than 125,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 in 117 countries, with 4,613 deaths. In the United States, there have been 1,629 confirmed cases in 46 states, with 41 deaths.
In a March 11 address, President Donald Trump announced a sweeping ban on travel from 26 European countries. While the White House maintains the move will slow the spread of the coronavirus, some experts doubt the restrictions will have much of an effect.
PolitiFact wanted to know whether Earhardt was correct to say that now is the safest time to fly. 
We reached out to Earhardt for evidence, but we haven’t heard back. Official guidance on COVID-19 contradicts what she said on Fox News.
Officials warn at-risk groups against traveling
Officials are advising older Americans and those with chronic health conditions to reconsider their domestic and international travel plans to avoid COVID-19.
On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there are ""several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel"" in the U.S., including:


Is COVID-19 spreading where you’re going?


Will you or someone you’re traveling with be in close contact with others during your trip?


Are you or someone you’re traveling with at risk of severe illness if you get COVID-19?


Do you live with someone who is older or has a severe chronic health condition?


Is COVID-19 spreading where you live?


If the answer to any of those questions is yes, then you may want to reconsider your travel plans to avoid potentially spreading or contracting the virus.
""CDC’s recommendations differ depending on the location,"" said agency spokeswoman Leslie Dorigo in an email. ""CDC recommends that older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel because they are at increased risk for severe disease.""
That’s because older and immunocompromised people, as well as those with chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, are more at risk of suffering complications from COVID-19. Younger people, even though they may not be as susceptible to the coronavirus, can still serve as carriers for the virus, potentially infecting new communities through travel.

""Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions,"" reads the Level 3 advisory. ""Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice.""
Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have issued similar travel advisories.
""It may not be safe to fly, especially if you’re going to one of the COVID-19 hotspots,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in an email. ""Generally speaking, it is just unwise to be traveling in any form right now.""
How safe are airplanes?
If you do have to travel via airplane, you’re unlikely to get sick while on board, officials say — as long as you practice good hygiene.
The WHO says there is little risk of disease transmission during a flight, mostly due to the way cabin air is filtered. During the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another human coronavirus, in 2003, the risk of disease transmission on airplanes was found to be very low.
Plus, airlines are taking extra steps to clean airplanes and slow the spread of COVID-19.
""Airlines are being more cautious about passengers, they’re doing extra cleaning and disinfecting and they are restricting flights,"" Watanabe said. ""So one might consider flying to be safer than ever.""
Still, it is possible to catch something from an infected person seated in the same area as you.
RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself
According to the CDC, COVID-19 spreads in two primary ways: close person-to-person contact (within about six feet) and respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes. If someone with the virus sneezes, those germs could land on surfaces around them, such as airplane seats and armrests. Then, an uninfected person who touches that same surface and then touches their nose, eyes or mouth could contract the virus.
If you do need to travel by plane, public health officials advise practicing good personal hygiene. The ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus include washing your hands with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, and avoiding people who are sick.
""We are trying to understand the ‘rules’ that govern transmission of COVID-19 and relative risk from people at different stages of disease, and/or contaminated surfaces and more,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, in an email. ""It seems unwise for commentators to offer travel advice until we who are more expert know far more.""
Our ruling
Earhardt said that ""it's actually the safest time to fly.""
Officials from the CDC and WHO are advising older people and those with chronic health conditions to reconsider travel in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The State Department has issued travel advisories for several individual countries, as well as a global health advisory, related to the disease outbreak. Other countries have taken similar steps. While the disease transmission on airplanes is thought to be a low risk, it is still possible to contract the coronavirus through close personal contact and respiratory droplets.

If Your Time is short





U.S. public health authorities and vaccine experts say there is no evidence that the vaccines’ spike protein is toxic or “cytotoxic,” which means toxic to cells.





See the sources for this fact-check




The headline on a YouTube video and a person who speaks in it make a troubling claim about the way the COVID-19 vaccines work. 
""Spike protein is very dangerous, it's cytotoxic,"" they say, referring to the molecule that triggers the body’s immune system to produce antibodies against COVID-19 infection. 
It’s one of a number of widely shared social media posts alleging  that the vaccines are toxic or ""cytotoxic,"" which means toxic to cells. 
The YouTube post, which was shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Experts say there is no evidence that the spike proteins produced by the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, or the spike protein created by genetic material in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, are toxic.
The video
The 15-minute video, posted June 13, shows three people speaking on a podcast.
Bret Weinstein, who is identified in the video as an evolutionary biologist, is the one who says the spike protein in the vaccines ""is very dangerous, it’s cytotoxic."" 
Dr. Robert Malone, identified in the video as the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology, said he sent ""manuscripts"" months ago to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration claiming the spike protein posed a health risk. ""And their determination was that they didn’t think that that was sufficient documentation of the risk that the spike was biologically active,"" he said.
The third person in the video is identified as ""serial entrepreneur"" Steve Kirsch, who said he is an engineer. He cited a claim by Canadian viral immunologist Byram Bridle that the vaccine doesn’t stay in the shoulder, where it’s injected, but ""goes throughout your entire body, it goes to your brain to your heart."" 
Bridle’s claim False
We rated False Bridle’s claim that the COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein means people are being inoculated ""with a toxin."" 
Experts told PolitiFact there is no evidence to back his allegation that the spike protein produces a toxin that could cause serious health problems.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The actual COVID-19 virus uses the spike protein to bind to cells, causing infection. But the mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, contain neither the virus nor the spike protein — just the genetic instructions for the body to make the spike protein associated with the coronavirus. 
Once the cell receives these instructions, it creates the protein and displays it on its surface. The immune system then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to protect against the virus. 
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine contains a modified adenovirus — not the COVID-19 virus — with a gene that induces cells to produce the spike protein, said vaccine expert Dr. Walter Orenstein at Emory University. As with the mRNA vaccines, this leads the immune system to recognize the spike protein as foreign and make an immune response against it, he said.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which calls the spike protein harmless, explains: ""Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection.""
An FDA spokesperson told PolitiFact: ""There is no scientific data to indicate that the spike protein in mRNA vaccines is toxic or that it lingers at any toxic level in the body after vaccination.""
Expert views
Responding to the claim made in the video, Emory’s Orenstein and vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said they are not aware of any major dangers from the spike protein.  
""Where is the evidence?"" said Offit. ""No one is saying that vaccines are risk free. The minute there’s any reasonable signal that things are occurring in a vaccinated group and not in an unvaccinated group, then the FDA takes a closer look.""
Offit noted as an example the federal response following reports of a small but higher-than-expected number of cases of heart inflammation — called myocarditis and pericarditis — developing in mostly young people after they received doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.
The CDC announced June 10 that it will convene an emergency meeting on June 18 to discuss a possible link between the condition and the vaccines.

Diamond and Silk, a pair of pro-Donald Trump activists who have more than 2.38 million followers on Facebook, made what appeared to be an authoritative claim about the risks of mask wearing.
Their widely shared Facebook post, since removed from public view, included a URL for a website of the federal government’s National Institutes of Health. And it displayed part of a medical journal article that listed ill effects said to be caused by masks.
""NO MORE MASK MANDATES! Follow the science,"" implored the post from sisters Lynnette Hardaway (Diamond) and Rochelle Richardson (Silk). 
The April 12 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The article cited by the post was written by an exercise physiologist in a journal called Medical Hypotheses and is entitled, ""Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis."" It is less science than what the post claims.

Medical Hypotheses says its purpose ""is to publish interesting theoretical papers. The journal will consider radical, speculative and non-mainstream scientific ideas provided they are coherently expressed.""

The first two alleged effects on the list, hypoxemia and hypercapnia, have been debunked by fact-checkers.
A fact-check by USA Today found that mask wearing does not cause hypoxemia, a below-normal level of oxygen in the blood. PolitiFact rated False a claim that masks decrease oxygen intake.
Lead Stories and USA Today were among fact-checkers that found that hypercapnia — too much carbon dioxide in the blood — is not caused by mask wearing. 
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that although the article appears to be presenting a hypothesis, many of the effects it claims cite evidence related to N95 masks typically used by healthcare workers. 
We’ve reported there are studies that show that medical N95 respirators may result in increased carbon dioxide, which can lead to headaches and fatigue.
PolitiFact has also rated False a claim that masks ""will kill quite a few people, it’s well known that they reduce blood oxygen levels and those with respiratory and cardiac disorders will die."" 
And we rated False a claim that wearing face masks is more harmful to your health than going without one.

Merritt claims in an interview segment that the vaccine was sent to states before it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
""This vaccine was rolled out to distribution centers before they even made a show of caring about the FDA approving it,"" she tells interviewer Alex Newman. ""It went out for distribution, I know in Nebraska, it was in the distribution center days before the FDA even said they were going to approve it.""

We looked into the timeline of the FDA’s approval of vaccines for emergency use, and when vaccine distribution began, and found no evidence for Merritt’s claim.
We reached out to Merritt twice for any evidence of her claim, but did not hear back.
Merritt, an orthopaedic surgeon, has spoken out against mask mandates, and has supported the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, which was touted by President Donald Trump as a possible COVID-19 treatment, has been the subject of several fact-checks by PolitiFact, and researchers have concluded that it’s not an effective treatment for COVID-19.

In Nebraska, the Department of Health and Human Services announced on Dec. 14 that the first doses of the Pfizer vaccine ""arrived in Nebraska today."" 
In the same announcement, the state said that it expected to receive 4,875 doses of the Pfizer vaccine by the end of the day and 15,600 by week's end.

Facebook posts","Yes, Gov. Newsom has the authority to make masks mandatory In California, legal experts say




If Your Time is short




Gov. Newsom has broad authority under the California Emergency Services Act to issue health mandates during a pandemic. 

Two constitutional law experts said Newsom does, indeed, have the power to make face coverings mandatory under that act. 


They said unless face coverings are shown to be ineffective, Newsom’s requirement should hold up against legal challenges.


Top public health officials and recent studies say wearing a face covering is an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19 when people gather.





See the sources for this fact-check




Following Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement last week that all Californians must wear face coverings in certain public settings, some local government officials and viral social media posts alleged the governor has no legal authority to make masks mandatory. 
One Facebook post viewed more than 80,000 times on the day of Newsom’s order claimed the governor hadn’t really made such a requirement and has no power to do so. 
‼️GREAT NEWS!‼️ Contrary to the LA Times story, Newsom did NOT issue any mandatory mask orders in CA! (He has no legal authority to do so.) This was new GUIDANCE (not a public health order) from the CA State Dept of Health, and it is a RELAXATION of the previous orders!!!
It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook).
The claim was made by a woman in Orange County who heads a group that also claims healthy people should not wear masks. PolitiFact in May found there’s no evidence that wearing standard masks, such as surgical masks or ones made of fabric, is harmful to the general public. 
In Northern California, Nevada City Mayor Reinette Senum claimed on Facebook ""Our Governor does NOT have that unilateral power to make such orders."" She linked to a YouTube video of the Orange County woman.  
While the act of wearing a mask, or choosing not to, has become politicized nationwide, leading public health officials and recent studies say wearing a face covering is an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19 when people gather. 
Newsom’s requirement is lauded by some and seen as an intrusion by others. For this fact check, we wanted to know whether it rests on solid legal footing. 
What Does Newsom’s Face Covering Requirement Say?
The governor announced new rules through a California Department of Public Health press release on June 18. ""Simply put, we are seeing too many people with faces uncovered – putting at risk the real progress we have made in fighting the disease,"" Newsom said in the release.
There’s been some confusion about whether the announcement makes wearing a mask mandatory because the new CDPH requirements are technically termed ""guidance."" 
But as the Sacramento Bee explained, a previous executive order issued by Newsom that required Californians to follow public health guidelines grants the state the ability to enforce CDPH rules.
The governor's office also made the announcement on social media: 

Here’s what’s mandatory under the new rules: 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are in the ""high-risk situations,"" including: 


Inside of, or in line to enter, any indoor public space 


Visiting a hospital, pharmacy, medical clinic, laboratory, physician or dental office, veterinary clinic, or blood bank 


Waiting for or riding on public transportation or paratransit or while in a taxi, private car service, or ride-sharing vehicle

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021









Some law enforcement agencies across the state have said they will not enforce the mandate, but will encourage residents to voluntarily comply with it. 
Is The Requirement Legal? 
We asked both the Newsom administration and two constitutional law experts about this issue. 
A spokesperson for the administration cited the California Emergency Services Act as giving the governor the power to make masks mandatory. Through that law, ""the State Legislature has given the Governor broad authority to respond to state emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Kate Folmar, a spokesperson for the state’s Health and Human Services Agency, said in an email.
Leslie Jacobs, who teaches constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, agreed that the act along with the state’s broad public health authority gives Newsom extensive power to address the pandemic, including requiring face coverings. It’s the same law he used to justify his statewide stay-at-home order in March. 
""That’s the authority under which the governor declared an emergency on March 4,"" Jacobs said. ""That transfers all the authority of the state to the governor, to the extent necessary, to address the COVID emergency.""
Jessica Levinson, who teaches at Loyola Law School, also said Newsom has the legal authority to require face coverings.
""Short answer – He does. Medium answer – He sure does. Longer answer – He sure as hell does,"" she wrote in an email. 
Levinson added in a phone interview that the state has ""broad authority when it comes to health and welfare measures."" 
Both law professors said they believe Newsom’s order would stand up to a legal challenge, unless new and credible studies show face coverings are not effective.
""Based on what we know now, I believe this would stand up,"" Levinson added. 
The professors said Newsom’s position would be strengthened should the Legislature pass a bill requiring face-coverings. But, they said, because Newsom’s requirement is so closely tied to an immediate public health issue, that action is probably unnecessary. 
Jacobs added that the governor’s powers during the pandemic are far-reaching. Under his authority, he could go even further to mandate things like temperature checks at sporting events or require face shields in some settings. 
Should the mask order or any future measures be challenged in court, she said Newsom would have to show that the state truly needs to require them and that they can only be done in the way prescribed by the state. 
Our ruling
Some local government leaders and widely-shared facebook posts claim Gov. Gavin Newsom doesn’t have the legal authority to make face coverings mandatory in California. 
To justify the move, the Newsom administration pointed to the California Emergency Services Act, the same authority it used to order a statewide stay-at-home requirement in March due to the COVID-19 crisis. 
Two constitutional law experts said Newsom, indeed, has broad powers under that law and under the state’s public health authority to make masks mandatory. 
Unless face coverings are shown to be ineffective, they said Newsom’s requirement should also hold up against legal challenges.
We rate the claim the governor doesn’t have the power to make masks mandatory as False.

The novel coronavirus outbreak has prompted renewed attention on controversial comments Thom Tillis made in 2015.
Tillis is the Republican incumbent running for U.S. Senate in North Carolina. He faces a challenge from Democrat Cal Cunningham in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country.
A new TV ad from Majority Forward PAC takes the senator’s old comments and presents them in the context of the pandemic. The ad highlights Tillis’ comments on regulation and hand washing. But it doesn’t play the audio.
Instead, a narrator says: ""He doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.""
An Asheville Citizen-Times headline appears on the screen: ""Tillis: Restaurant workers shouldn't have to wash hands."" That’s a reference to the paper’s article about Tillis’ comments.
But did Tillis really say that? 
The attack ad is misleading. 
Comments from 2015
Tillis talked about handwashing on Feb. 3, 2015 at an event of the Bipartisan Policy Center. A clip from the event is available on C-SPAN’s website.
At the event, Tillis recalled a conversation he had with a friend. He said they were sitting in a Starbucks when an opportunity presented itself to make a point about business regulations in the U.S.

""And at that time we were sitting back at a table that was near the restrooms and one of the employees just came out. She said, ‘For example, don’t you believe that this regulation that requires this gentleman to wash his hands before he serves your food is important, should be on the books?’ I said, as a matter of fact, I think it’s one that I can illustrate the point. 
""I don't have any problem with Starbucks if they choose to opt out of this policy, as long as they post a sign that says, 'We don't require our employees to wash their hands after leaving the restroom.’ The market will take care of that. 
""It's one example — but then let them decide. Now that's probably one where every business that did that would go out of business, but I think it's good to illustrate the point that that's the sort of mentality that we have to have to reduce the regulatory burden on this country.""
There’s an important distinction that needs to be made here. Tillis never said restaurant employees shouldn’t be required to wash their hands. Tillis said he would be fine if the government didn’t require employees to wash their hands.

Under the fictional scenario Tillis presented, businesses could choose to have a handwashing policy. And if businesses disclosed that they didn’t require employee handwashing, Tillis said they would likely go out of business.
In other words, Tillis argued that regulations aren’t needed because market forces would prompt business owners to do the right thing. He offered an opinion on business regulations, not the health benefits of hand washing.
Other comments
Another misleading aspect of the ad is that it mentions Tillis’ handwashing comments in the present tense. The beginning of the ad shows someone washing their hands.
A narrator says: ""Everyone does it. Especially now. Well, maybe not everyone.""
Then it shows a photo of Tillis.
But Tillis clarified his 2015 comments shortly after making them. In an interview with The Hill in 2015, Tillis said his comments weren’t meant to be taken seriously.
""Of course (handwashing) needs to be regulated,"" Tillis said. ""If you noticed it was one of the instances at the very tail end, it was clearly meant as a joke. Even (the moderator) at the end said, 'Well, now I'm not sure I should shake your hand.' It was just fun.""
In an interview with HuffPost, he blamed any controversy on a blogger ""without a sense of humor.""
It’s also inaccurate to suggest that Tillis hasn’t encouraged handwashing during the pandemic.
On April 6, he told Fox 8: ""If we want to get out of this sooner, then everybody in North Carolina needs to make sure they’re staying at home, social distancing, washing their hands, all the things that they’re being asked to do every single day.""
He made the same point in a tweet the next day.
Asked about the ad, Majority Forward spokeswoman Rachel Irwin said the old Tillis comments are ""fair game.""
""North Carolinians deserve to know that Tillis holds such extreme views, especially during a pandemic when their health and safety are further at risk,"" Irwin said. ""I think health and safety experts would agree that his view is problematic and he should have to answer for it.""
Our ruling
The ad says Tillis ""doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.""
He never said restaurant workers shouldn’t wash their hands. In context, he was saying he didn’t think the government needed to regulate handwashing at restaurants, because customers would stop going if that happened. He later reversed that statement, saying ""of course"" it needs to be regulated. 
What’s more, his 2015 comments had nothing to do with the pandemic. During the pandemic, Tillis has held up hand washing as an important public response.

• The Alexa answer in the post refers to a real project called Event 201 that simulated possible outcomes of a coronavirus pandemic. However, it was a planning exercise and did not predict the COVID-19 pandemic. 
• We were unable to elicit the same answer from Alexa, and Amazon told us that the answer to that question would be different.

A Facebook video that racked up thousands of shares claims the coronavirus now spreading across the world was planned and released by the United States government — and it says that this claim is backed up by ""Alexa,"" the voice of the Amazon Echo. 
Echo is a voice-activated home speaker that can provide the user with answers to questions and other content by searching the internet for information. Echo users connect with the device by conversing with ""Alexa,"" the system’s ""virtual assistant.""
The March 31 video is a recording of a TikTok video playing on another smartphone. The man recording the Facebook video warns viewers of his fears that the TikTok video will be deleted from the platform. In the TikTok, a man asks his Amazon Echo, ""Alexa, did the government release the coronavirus?"" 
In the video, Alexa’s computer-generated voice responds: ""According to Event 201, the government planned this event, created the virus and had a simulation of how the countries would react. This simulation occurred October 18, 2019. The government released the virus among the population and has lost control of the outbreak."" 
The spread of misinformation about the coronavirus on TikTok and through Amazon Alexa have recently been reported by outlets such as WUSA9’s VERIFY team and Vox. Let’s take a closer look.
What is Event 201?
There was an Event 201, involving a simulated viral pandemic. And it did take place on Oct. 18, 2019, at a hotel in New York. But no actual virus was created or released.
During the event, officials from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and 15 global business, government and public health leaders held a 3.5 hour simulation to view the potential effects of an infectious pandemic.
The exercise consisted of pre-recorded news broadcasts, live ""staff"" briefings, and moderated discussions on specific topics, the organizers said. 
The purpose of the simulation was to examine how industries, governments and public health leaders might have to join forces to combat a global health crisis. It was inspired by research published by the World Economic Forum, an international foundation that studies the intersection of business, politics and academics and their impacts on policy.
The pandemic in the fictionalized scenario was caused by a coronavirus, of which there are many types. 
The study found that a pandemic could cause an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global gross domestic product, or about $570 billion. The businesses and political leaders involved in the simulation were tasked with working together to create viable solutions to the theoretical pandemic. 
The participants’ conclusion was that ""the next severe pandemic will not only cause great illness and loss of life but could also trigger major cascading economic and societal consequences that could contribute greatly to global impact and suffering.""

Now that the world is grappling with an actual coronavirus pandemic, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has released a statement reaffirming that the simulation did not predict the current outbreak, but rather was an exercise to examine what would need to happen if one did occur. 
""For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,"" the center said. ""Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic.""
Alexa’s Response 
Why did the question posed to Alexa bring up Event 201? 
That only happens in the TikTok video. We asked Alexa directly, and it brought up a different response.
Alexa said, ""According to the World Health Organization, the exact cause of the current outbreak of COVID-19 is still under investigation. On December 31, 2019, it was reported to the WHO country office in China that a new coronavirus strain later, named COVID-19, was identified by Chinese researchers in connection with a pneumonia-like illness based in Wuhan city, China."" 
A spokesperson at Amazon told PolitiFact that the one appearing in the video ""is not Alexa's response to customers, and we have not been able to replicate this example."" 
The company said that any news Alexa is providing to customers about COVID-19 is from official government sources.
The company suggested a couple of explanations why Alexa might have responded the way it did in the video. 
One possibility is that a customer set a specific response for Alexa. Responses can be recorded and scheduled, like a daily reminder service. This response would play only on that customer’s device, not the system at large. 
Another possibility involves Alexa Skill Blueprints, which offer templates for trivia games, birthday cards, and flashcards. With this feature, users can create their own automated questions and responses. 
Our Ruling 
Facebook posts say that if you ask Amazon’s Alexa about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, it says ""the government planned"" it and refers to something called ""Event 201.""
There was a project called Event 201 that simulated possible outcomes of a coronavirus pandemic, but it was a planning exercise and did not predict this specific COVID-19 pandemic. 
More importantly, we were unable to elicit the same answer from Alexa, and Amazon told us that the answer to that question would be different.
