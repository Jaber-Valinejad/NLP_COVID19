John Bel Edwards","Louisiana governor is right, there was no suggestion Mardi Gras had to be canceled




If Your Time is short





The Carnival season in New Orleans kicked off early January and ended Feb. 25.


There were few coronavirus cases in the United States at the time, and health officials then said there was no community spread.


The earliest indication we found from a federal agency saying that large events may need to be canceled came Feb. 26, after Mardi Gras celebrations. 





See the sources for this fact-check




Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards on CNN was asked whether Mardi Gras celebrations in his state should have been called off earlier this year, in light of Louisiana now being considered a hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic.
In New Orleans, the Carnival parades and celebrations started early January and ended Feb. 25 on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday). It’s estimated that more than 1 million people go to New Orleans annually for the Carnival season and experts now believe the festivities fueled the outbreak.
""The biggest Mardi Gras parades in Louisiana took place on Feb. 25, just as the national outbreak was starting. In retrospect, if you knew then what you know now, would you have canceled Mardi Gras?"" CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Edwards on April 5.
""Well, you know you don't get a do-over like that, Jake,"" Edwards said. ""There was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel Mardi Gras. And, you know, in February, we had a Super Bowl, and it wasn't canceled and so forth.""
Edwards’ comments echoed a similar statement from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell 10 days earlier on CNN that there were ""no red flags"" from federal officials to suggest the festivities should be aborted.
PolitiFact wondered if it’s true that there were no suggestions back in January or February that mass gatherings like Mardi Gras be canceled.
We reviewed statements from President Donald Trump, and guidance from federal and state public health agencies and found that Edwards was right. Public health professors in Louisiana also told PolitiFact that there was no suggestion, prior to Mardi Gras, of community spread in the United States, much less New Orleans.
The earliest suggestion we found from a federal agency saying that large events may need to be canceled came Feb. 26, after Mardi Gras celebrations.
Messaging from Trump
On Twitter and in public remarks, Trump did not suggest that large public events be canceled. In India on Feb. 25 and before leaving for India on Feb. 23, Trump said the coronavirus was very ""under control"" in the United States.
Trump tweeted about the virus at least eight times from January to Feb. 25.
His tweets generally said that his administration was in contact with China and others about the coronavirus, offered praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s handling of the outbreak, and said that his administration was monitoring developments and had it under control.
On Lundi Gras, the day before Mardi Gras, he tweeted: 
The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2020 
 
Messaging from public health agencies
When the U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Jan. 31, the government did not say that mass gatherings be canceled.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Throughout January and most of February, U.S. officials said that the coronavirus risk to the American public was low and that they were not seeing community spread of the virus. By Feb. 25, there were 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States and no deaths, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization.
On Feb. 26, the day after Mardi Gras, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctor told reporters that the coronavirus situation was rapidly evolving and that the virus was spreading worldwide.
There were still only a few cases in the United States and no reports of community spread, but that would eventually change, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She said there were mitigation guidelines that people and communities could take during a pandemic when there wasn’t a vaccine or proven medical treatment for the disease.
""On a larger scale, communities and cities may need to modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings,"" Messonnier said. Local communities would need to figure out which guidelines to implement and when, she said, based on the severity and the transmission of the disease and what could be done locally.
On Feb. 28, Messonnier said it was possible that a reported case in California ""could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, Messonnier said. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said.
On Feb. 29, a health official from Washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of COVID-19, joined a CDC press briefing and said the state was ""starting to see some spread in the community"" and the public risk was increasing. ""Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,"" said Kathy Lofy, the state health officer at the Washington state department of health.
There were no reported cases of coronavirus in Louisiana during the weeks-long Carnival celebrations. The state’s department of health in blog posts as late as Feb. 21 said that the coronavirus threat to Louisiana was very low and that people should be more worried about the flu. It recommended that people wash their hands and get a flu shot, since it was still flu season.
Louisiana’s first presumptive case of coronavirus was reported March 9, two days before the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus a pandemic. On March 13, when Louisiana had 33 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, Edwards signed a proclamation to stop gatherings of more than 250 people and close all K-12 public schools statewide to slow the spread of the disease.
Based on models created mid-March, it’s assumed that infections silently spread in crowded parades during Mardi Gras, said Susanne Straif-Bourgeois, an associate professor of epidemiology at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans. Soon after Mardi Gras, epidemiologists from nearby states began reporting confirmed cases of coronavirus in people who had traveled to New Orleans for the festivities. But at the time that parade-goers gathered in streets with family and friends, it was not known that the virus was in the state, Straif-Bourgeois said.
In his CNN interview with Edwards, Tapper said the Washington Post reported that governors had a gala in Washington, D.C. in early February, and that a group of governors met with federal experts who gave ""the same dire warning that they’re giving now.""
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told the Washington Post, ""The doctors and the scientists, they were telling us then exactly what they are saying now.""
Edwards told Tapper that in that Feb. 9 briefing, ""we spoke generally about the novel coronavirus"" and that it was ""not accurate to say that they gave the same sort of information that they are providing right now,"" since a lot more is now known about the virus.
Edwards’ deputy chief of staff, Christina Stephens, told PolitiFact that at that briefing, the virus was described as low risk and there was no suggestion that large gatherings be canceled.
In a Feb. 9 press release about the briefing, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said the task force ""reiterated that while this is a serious public health matter, the risk to the American public remains low at this time, and that the federal government will continue working in close coordination with state and local governments to keep it that way.""
Our ruling
Edwards said of the coronavirus threat, ""there was not a single suggestion by anyone, a doctor, a scientist, a political figure, that we needed to cancel Mardi Gras.""
New Orleans Mardi Gras celebrations began early January and ended Feb. 25. PolitiFact reviewed public comments from Trump, federal and state health officials on and before Feb. 25 and did not find suggestions that large public events be cancelled. At that time, there was no report of community spread of the virus.

Glenn Grothman","Glenn Grothman on target about tie between vitamin D and COVID-19, but vitamin D isn’t a known cure




If Your Time is short





U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman touted a correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and COVID-19 deaths, suggesting the supplement may help combat the virus. 


Early research verifies that correlation, but more work needs to be done. 


Grothman emphasized that point and didn’t imply vitamin D is a cure for COVID-19. 





See the sources for this fact-check




People across the globe continue to seek answers on how to defeat the coronavirus that has sickened millions.
One proposed solution has gained attention in recent weeks: Vitamin D.
A link between vitamin D and COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, caught the eye of U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah. 
In a May 21, 2020 news release, Grothman encouraged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to look into vitamin D’s impact on the virus. 
""Research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and (higher) COVID-19 mortality rates,"" the release said.
Studies cited by Grothman do suggest vitamin D deficiencies may have contributed to COVID-19 deaths in some countries. But many questions remain about the relationship between the two, and researchers say more work should be done to better understand it.
Is Grothman right about the correlation?
Vitamin D and COVID-19 deaths
Grothman’s news release cited studies out of Northwestern University and Trinity College in Dublin that reached similar conclusions: Countries with more deaths from the virus, such as Spain and Italy, also had higher rates of vitamin D deficiencies. 
""We saw a significant correlation with vitamin D deficiency,"" Vadim Backman, a Northwestern professor who helped author one study, told the university website Northwestern Now.
Why look into vitamin D in the first place?
Aside from building healthy bones, vitamin D can boost the immune system by suppressing what’s called a cytokine storm — severe inflammation that occurs when the immune system becomes overactive and releases too many cytokine proteins.
Backman said cytokine storms may contribute to COVID-19 deaths because the storms can damage people’s lungs. An April 17, 2020 article on WebMD also indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms had high levels of cytokines in their system.
The idea, then, is that vitamin D could suppress a catastrophic immune response and prevent people from developing severe COVID-19 symptoms that lead to death.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







""It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected,"" Backman said in the interview.
Let’s return to Grothman.
He did not say researchers found a connection, only a correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths. That’s on target. Vitamin D is by no means a cure for the virus, and Grothman conceded that we don’t yet know the extent of the relationship.
In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman reiterated his belief that federal agencies should further explore the issue. 
""I think a lot of times, the CDC and (National Institutes of Health) and that crowd primarily focus on new drugs,"" he said. ""If you have something right under your nose, let’s go with it.""
What researchers say
For now, researchers caution against reading too much into the available studies. 
J. Wesley Pike, a biochemistry professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said there is not enough proof yet to suggest a meaningful relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19. Researchers will need to conduct further studies to determine if that vitamin is effective in combating the coronavirus.
""There’s simply no evidence that taking vitamin D will protect you,"" Pike said. ""But again, we don’t know. The answer is it’s possible."" 
A group of researchers in Europe and the United Kingdom noted in a May 2020 paper that vitamin D supports the immune system and is recommended to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle. People can up their intake and avoid deficiencies through supplements, eating vitamin D-rich food and getting safe sunlight exposure.
But vitamin D is not a ""magic bullet"" to prevent or treat COVID-19, they wrote, and should not be taken in excessive doses that could present their own health risks.
Our ruling
Grothman claimed ""research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and (higher) COVID-19 mortality rates.""
Early studies into vitamin D suggests it may curb the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and reduce mortality rates. Further research is needed to examine the issue, and vitamin D is not a cure for the coronavirus. 
But Grothman did not say it was a cure, only that there was a correlation. One expert noted the correlation was ""significant""
We rate his claim True.

If Your Time is short




North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Georgia has “almost 100,000 more cases, almost twice as many deaths and almost 600 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina.”
On the night of the debate, data from each state’s health department showed Georgia with about 98,100 more cases and nearly twice as many deaths.
According to U.S. CMS data, Georgia also had 569 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina.




See the sources for this fact-check




Roy Cooper and Dan Forest agree that North Carolina’s coronavirus response stands out among southern states.
But the gubernatorial candidates disagree over whether that’s a good thing.
Democratic Gov. Cooper and Republican Lt. Gov. Forest squared off on Wednesday night for North Carolina’s only gubernatorial debate of the year. At one point in the debate, Forest praised North Carolina’s border states for allowing many businesses to reopen while their respective governments addressed the coronavirus outbreak.
""This COVID science is an interesting thing because you cross the border into South Carolina and South Carolina’s open and people are out there going to restaurants and doing things,"" Forest said. ""You cross into Tennessee and Tennessee is open, you cross into Georgia and Georgia is open. They’re learning how to live with the virus and protect the vulnerable and get people back to work.""
Cooper immediately offered a comparison between North Carolina and Georgia.
""It’s interesting that Dan mentions Georgia … He wants to be like Georgia,"" Cooper said. ""Georgia is about the same size as North Carolina, yet they have almost 100,000 more cases, almost twice as many deaths and almost 600 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina.""
Cooper is right about the sizes of North Carolina and Georgia. Georgia is the eighth most populous state in the U.S. and North Carolina is the ninth most populous, according to 2019 census data. The states are separated by fewer than 130,000 people.
So what about those stats Cooper mentioned?
Cooper spokeswoman Liz Doherty referred us to a coronavirus tracker on the New York Times website and nursing home data on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website. PolitiFact North Carolina also looked at information on the North Carolina and Georgia state websites.
Case counts vary a little bit, depending on the source. But otherwise, Cooper is mostly spot-on.
Comparing cases
Cooper said Georgia has almost 100,000 more cases than North Carolina. On the night of the debate, data from each state’s health department showed Georgia with about 98,100 more cases. So Cooper’s not far off. 
North Carolina’s health department reported 236,407 confirmed cases and Georgia’s health department reported 334,601 cases.

The New York Times map showed 236,810 cases for North Carolina and 319,609 total cases for Georgia, for a difference of about 82,800.
Cooper didn’t compare each state’s infection numbers to its population. But that statistic provides useful context.
The night of the debate, the New York Times’ reported that North Carolina had 2,258 cases per 100,000 residents and Georgia had 3,010 cases per 100,000 residents.
Comparing deaths
Cooper said Georgia had ""almost twice as many deaths"" as North Carolina. This claim is on track too.
On the night of the debate, North Carolina’s health department reported 3,856 total deaths. Twice that many would be 7,712 deaths. Georgia’s health department reported 7,470 total deaths. 
The Times, meanwhile, reported 3,882 total deaths in North Carolina (a rate of 37 deaths per 100,000 residents) and 7,298 total deaths in Georgia (meaning 69 deaths per 100,000 people.)
So if you look at total deaths, the Times and the NC health department both show there have been about 3,800. Georgia is 200 to 400 deaths away from having twice as many. 
Nursing homes
Finally, let’s look at nursing homes.
Cooper said Georgia has had almost 600 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina. On debate night, data tracked by the federal government showed Georgia having 569 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina.
CMS reported 1,328 nursing home deaths in North Carolina and 1,897 in Georgia.
Cooper didn’t mention nursing home cases. To round out the full picture, we’ll report them anyway.
On the night of the debate, CMS reported 6,523 total nursing home cases in North Carolina and 9,483 total cases in Georgia.
Our ruling
Cooper said Georgia has ""almost 100,000 more cases, almost twice as many deaths and almost 600 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina.""

Verifying absentee ballots
A breakdown of absentee rules is available via the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group that tracks various laws in each state.
In most states -- 31 according to the NCSL -- elections boards simply compare the voter’s signature on an absentee ballot with a signature they already have on file for the voter. If there’s a discrepancy, election officials investigate.

North Carolina is one of eight states that requires a witness to sign a voter’s absentee ballot, and one of only three states that requires the ballot to be signed by two witnesses if a notary isn’t available. The other states are Alabama and Rhode Island.
The information on the NCSL website was confirmed as accurate by conference spokeswoman Wendy Underhill.
That doesn’t necessarily mean that North Carolina is the hardest state to return an absentee ballot.
Alabama, in addition to requiring signatures from two witnesses or a notary, requires voters to submit a copy of a voter ID with his ballot.

Earlier this month, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf halted indoor dining, closed casinos, gyms, and entertainment venues, and lowered retail occupancy limits statewide for the first time since the spring. The new restrictions came as the state started reporting more than 10,000 new infections per day. 

 
Before this latest round of closures, all 67 Pennsylvania counties had been in the “green” phase of the Wolf administration’s three-step reopening plan since July 3, even though Trump falsely claimed otherwise on the campaign trail. 

 
Across the country, at least seven other states and the District of Columbia have joined Pennsylvania and imposed restrictions on large numbers of businesses. They include Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico.

When President Donald Trump threatened to reject the coronavirus economic relief package passed with wide bipartisan support, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey appeared on Fox News to defend the plan and stress how urgently businesses need relief. 
""In my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again,"" Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said Sunday before Trump relented and signed the measure into law.

Wolf said he hoped the restrictions would slow the spread of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed just before vaccines become widely available. 
""This is a bridge to a better future in Pennsylvania,"" Wolf said. 
Before this latest round of closures, all 67 Pennsylvania counties had been in the ""green"" phase of the Wolf administration’s three-step reopening plan since July 3, even though Trump falsely claimed otherwise on the campaign trail. That allowed many businesses to operate at 75% capacity. 
Since the new rules took effect on Dec. 11, the number of new cases reported each day in Pennsylvania fell to as low as 4,621 on Dec. 27, and the seven-day average fell to 7,757.

The restrictions are set to expire on Jan. 4, but Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the state may extend them if cases climb again in the days ahead. A local ban on indoor dining in Philadelphia will remain in effect until Jan. 15.
Soon after Wolf announced this latest round of restrictions, at least a dozen gym and restaurant owners across Pennsylvania publicly vowed to defy them. 
Business owners argued they should be allowed to stay open because internal data they collected showed their establishments hadn’t been the source of any community spread. A recent Stanford University study, however, linked restaurants, gyms, and crowded indoor spaces to 80% of infections in 10 U.S. cities in the early months of the pandemic. 
""If I have to prove my point by being taken out in handcuffs, then so be it,"" said Phil Guarno, who owns Fenicci’s Italian restaurant in Hershey, Pa., which has remained open for indoor dining despite the new order. ""It’s gotten to the point where it’s really do or die. It’s time to stand up against this tyranny.""
The relief bill includes a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses like Guarno’s, as well as temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefits for the unemployed and $600 direct payments to most Americans. Schools, healthcare providers, and renters facing eviction will also get relief. 
Across the country, at least seven other states and the District of Columbia have joined Pennsylvania and imposed restrictions on large numbers of businesses. They include Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Ten states have halted activity at some businesses, and elsewhere, establishments remain largely open even as the pandemic rages on.

Pat Toomey","Will homemade masks stop coronavirus from spreading? Fact-checking Sen. Pat Toomey’s claim




If Your Time is short




Last weekend, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey recorded a message about how to stop the spread of the coronavirus and posted it on Twitter. His message was simple and direct – start wearing a homemade mask when you leave the house. He was the first member of Congress to suggest this.

 
For weeks, public health officials advised healthy Americans not to wear masks. But on Friday, President Donald Trump announced that the guidance had changed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging everyone to wear homemade cloth masks when they leave the house.

 
Trump said the guidance shifted because research indicates that people who are infected with the coronavirus but aren’t showing any symptoms can still transmit the disease. He also reiterated that wearing homemade masks is not a replacement for other strategies such as social distancing and hand-washing.

Last weekend, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey recorded a message about how to stop the spread of the coronavirus and posted it on Twitter. His message was simple and direct – start wearing a homemade mask when you leave the house. 
""My mask will keep someone else safe and their mask will keep me safe,"" said Toomey, a Republican from the Lehigh Valley. ""I’m not suggesting this is any kind of guarantee. It probably doesn’t have tremendous value for the person wearing the mask but it probably does significantly reduce the risk that people could inadvertently transmit it.""
Since masks for health care workers are in such short supply, we wondered whether Toomey’s claim is true. 
For weeks, public health officials advised healthy Americans not to wear masks. But on Friday, President Donald Trump announced that the guidance had changed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging everyone to wear homemade cloth masks when they leave the house, just as Toomey called for a week ago. He was the first member of Congress to advocate for the shift. 
But even as Trump announced the new rules, he said he didn’t plan to follow them himself. 
""It’s voluntary so you don’t have to do it,"" Trump said at Friday’s daily coronavirus briefing. ""They suggest it for a period of time. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.""
Trump said the guidance shifted because research indicates that people who are infected with the coronavirus but aren’t showing any symptoms can still transmit the disease. He also reiterated that wearing homemade masks is not a replacement for other strategies such as social distancing and hand-washing.
""We want to make sure everybody understands it’s not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out,"" Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said Thursday.

Toomey got another thing right. Homemade masks are significantly more effective at preventing asymptomatic carriers of the virus from accidentally spreading it than they are at shielding a healthy person from contracting it. And the efficacy of any homemade mask depends on how it’s made. 
The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearer’s face.
""Given the current crisis, and lacking an alternative, many layers of densely woven fabric would be the most effective, because it allows for lots of voids in the layers where particles can be trapped,"" Richard Peltier, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, told us by email. ""The mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks, though this may not be possible with different designs, fabrics, or face shapes. Thin or porous fabrics are the least likely to be effective.""
A study published in October 2010 tested how cloth masks and common fabrics fared when sprayed with aerosols at different speeds. All of the materials performed worse than hospital-grade N95 respirators. But some, such as cotton towels and scarves, were in the range of some surgical masks. The authors cautioned that fabric materials ""show only marginal filtration performance against virus-size particles when sealed around the edges.""
Another study from 2013 found that cotton masks only perform about half as well as surgical masks and ""should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals."" More recent research had similar results.
So at best, using thick or layered fabric to make a homemade mask could be as effective as using some surgical masks. At worst, it prevents at least some of your respiratory droplets from spreading to others while in public.
Under ideal circumstances, no face masks are intended to be worn for more than one encounter. That guidance also extends to homemade masks.
""At the end of the day, these cloth masks should be treated as contaminated materials that you bring in to your home — they need to be laundered in hot soapy water, and you’d need to consider sanitizing in bleach or hydrogen peroxide regularly,"" Peltier said.
Our ruling 
Toomey’s claim that his homemade mask would keep someone else safe and that someone else’s homemade mask would keep him safe matches the latest guidance from the CDC.

Mike Gallagher","Data shows in-person learning safer than expected, not driving case spikes




If Your Time is short




Schools around the country shifted to virtual learning in March, fearing the close contacts in schools would spur coronavirus infections.

 
But in-person learning conducted in the U.S. and around the world hasn't lead to spikes in coronavirus cases.

 
Dr. Fauci and other experts have recommended shifting back to in-person learning in light of the case data and the educational shortcomings of widespread virtual learning.




See the sources for this fact-check




The ideological split on in-person schooling during the pandemic was pretty predictable through most of 2020.
Those who generally favored lockdowns and other strong mitigation measures opposed in-person schooling, while those who derided lockdowns, mask orders and the like typically supported it.
Like much related to COVID-19, however, positions have shifted on this issue as more data and studies have emerged.
One prominent Wisconsin Republican says that research now supports a more widescale return to the classroom.
""It's time to get kids back in school,"" U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, said in a Dec. 7, 2020, tweet. ""New data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases, and school closures leave us with the worst of both worlds: students falling further behind without a significant impact on slowing the spread.""
Is Gallagher right that in-person learning isn’t driving a spike in cases?
In a word: Yes.
The cost of online schooling
The push against virtual schooling — embraced by most school districts starting in March — has strengthened as a growing body of research shows the toll being out of the classroom takes on learning.
In fall 2020 assessments, students in grades 3 to 8 performed similarly to same-grade students last year in reading, but 5 to 10 percentage points lower in math, according to a November report from NWEA, a research-based nonprofit group that assessed 4.4 million students.
A November report from Renaissance Learning Inc. similarly found students falling behind in math, with some grades 12 weeks or more behind.
The move online has in many cases worsened existing socioeconomic achievement gaps as well, since online learning works only when students have consistent internet access and home support, according to research compiled by the Economic Policy Institute and others.
Meanwhile, the science shows school doesn’t present the risk many experts expected.
What we’ve learned from the schools that opened
As with many other pandemic response measures, the diversity of local guidelines governing schools has created a natural experiment.
""Children and schools are not the main drivers of the epidemic across countries,"" said a UNICEF report published in November. ""Evidence shows that the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them. Data from 191 countries show no consistent association between school reopening status and COVID-19 infection rates.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







An international research report out of Spain found a similar lack of correlation, as did a study by Insights for Education that said there is ""no consistent pattern between school status and infection levels.""
Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is now advocating for a measured return to in-class instruction.
""The default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school,"" he said on ABC’s ""This Week"" on Nov. 29, 2020. ""If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all, not like one would have suspected. So, let's try to get the kids back, but let's try to mitigate the things that maintain and just push … community spread"" like capacity seating indoors at restaurants and bars.
One project run by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, has gathered data from 13 million in-person students (some multiple times) since September, in partnership with schools around the U.S. That data showed an infection rate of 2.2 students per 1,000 over a two-week period. The staff infection rate over that span was 4.2 per 1,000.
(Wisconsin was notably worse in both categories, averaging 7 infections per 1,000 students and 19 per 1,000 staff members)
""The numbers are small — smaller than what many had forecasted,"" Oster wrote in an Atlantic article detailing her early findings in October.
CDC data shows children under age 18 make up about 10% of cases in the U.S., though they comprise 22% of the total population. (Children account for just 0.1% of deaths.)
The key asterisk is that in-person instruction is safest when mitigation measures remain in place in both schools and the community.
The CDC recommends use of masks and following other guidelines such as social distancing, washing hands, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. PolitiFact Missouri noted this in rating Mostly True a claim that schools using these strategies ""remain among the safest places for our students.""
Jordan Dunn, press secretary for Gallagher, cited this research and Fauci’s comments in defending Gallagher’s statement.
""That’s not to say there isn’t transmission in schools and schools should re-open without common sense safety measures,"" Dunn said in an email. ""But the data that has been collected suggests, as Rep. Gallagher states, that in-person learning is not driving spikes in cases and schools are not super-spreaders.""
Our ruling
Gallagher said, ""New data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases.""
Indeed, research from an array of sources in October and November show in-person instruction has not been tied to increased cases in those areas.
Key leaders including Fauci have acknowledged classroom instruction caused fewer issues than expected, leading him to support a shift away from virtual learning.

Darren Jackson","North Carolina Democrat right: most Americans want Trump to wear a mask




If Your Time is short




Health experts say Americans should wear a face mask to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but President Trump has been reluctant to do so in public.
Democrat Darren Jackson, the minority leader in the North Carolina House of Representatives, said two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Trump's decision.
There's one poll that supports his exact claim, and several others showing that roughly 66% of Americans want Trump to wear a mask.




See the sources for this fact-check




When North Carolina legislators returned to the Capitol, the House minority leader showed up wearing a surgical mask bearing the state flag.
Health experts recommend that Americans wear face masks while in public to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which can be transmitted through aerosol droplets.
So Darren Jackson, the Democratic leader in the GOP-controlled state House, has urged his colleagues to do the same. And on May 27, Jackson offered some advice for President Donald Trump.
""Two thirds of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump not wearing a face mask in public, and the vast majority supports elected officials being required to wear masks in government buildings,"" Jackson tweeted.

Is he right about the polling on Trump?
Overall, yes: Polls show that most poll respondents believe the president should wear a mask, though the level of support varies by political affiliation.
What polls show
When we reached out to Jackson, he cited an online survey of 1,012 people by Navigator Research, a pollster that works with Democratic and progressive clients.
Their poll question asked, ""Do you approve or disapprove of Donald Trump’s decision NOT to wear a face mask while in public?"" 
Of the group, 27% said they approve, and 65% said they disapprove.
This poll was conducted using an opt-in system, with respondents volunteering to participate. However, the data was weighted for ""a variety of demographic variables"" to approximate the national registered voter population, the firm said.
A look at other polls using a variety of survey methods found similar results when asking whether Trump should wear a mask in public.
The Navigator poll stands out because it asked people whether they approved of Trump’s decision, while other polls asked about masks without mentioning his behavior. Still, the results were comparable.
Here's what they found:

Quinnipiac poll between May 14-18: 67% support


Huffington Post and YouGov poll over May 14-16: 63% support


Politico and Morning Consult poll between May 8-10: 70% support


Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted May 13-18: 72% support


The Quinnipiac and Kaiser polls used phone calls, while the HuffPost/YouGov and Politico/Morning Consult polls were online.
Partisan differences
The most obvious divergence of views comes from partisan identification.
While these surveys consistently show overall support for Trump wearing a mask, Republicans are far less enthusiastic. Here’s the amount of support for the idea from Republicans in each poll:


Quinnipiac: 38% support


HuffPost/YouGov: 46% support (with 44% among ""Trump voters"")


Politico/Morning Consult: 58% support


Kaiser Family Foundation: 48% support


The HuffPost/YouGov gave respondents the option to answer ""I don’t care either way,"" which was the most common answer among Republicans and Trump voters.
So, among these four polls, support for Trump wearing a mask ranges between 63% and 72% among all types of voters, but it drops to between 38% and 58% among Republicans. And the Navigation Research poll found that 54% of Republicans approve of Trump’s decision not to wear a mask.

Monica Wallace","Do two months of coronavirus deaths exceed the number of drug overdoses in the last year?




If Your Time is short



• Nationally, more than 96,000 Americans died of the coronavirus in April and May 2020.
• That exceeds the 70,000 Americans who died of drug overdoses in the higher of the two most recent years, 2017.



See the sources for this fact-check




A federal prosecutor and a state lawmaker from western New York sparred recently over the scale of coronavirus deaths in their state.
In a May 30 op-ed in the Buffalo News, James P. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York, urged a quicker reopening of the economy, in part because he said that a failure to do so would cause psychological harm and spur deaths from drug abuse.
In the op-ed, Kennedy said he has seen a ""roughly three-fold increase in the number of drug overdose deaths"" during the pandemic. As the country is struggling economically, he wrote, ""such measures come at a cost that goes well beyond the adverse impact they have had on our economy.""
This argument drew a response from Monica P. Wallace, a Democratic assemblywoman for the 143rd District of New York. She told the Buffalo News that Kennedy glossed over the reality that significantly more people died due to the coronavirus in two months than died of overdoses all of last year.
The Buffalo News paraphrased Wallace’s remark this way: ""Wallace said Kennedy failed to mention that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.""
When we reached her, Wallace confirmed that the paraphrase was accurate.
We found that her assertion is correct.
How many COVID-19 related deaths were there in two months?
For the number of coronavirus deaths, Wallace referred us to a count by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found from the beginning of April until the end of May, approximately 96,647 people died in the United States.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The total number of deaths through mid-June was 103,339, according to the CDC. However, this may be an underestimate due to difficulties in collecting the full data.
How many people have died of drug overdoses last year and the previous year? 
For the number of overdoses, Wallace referred us to CDC data. 
The CDC’s most recent full-year data is for 2018. That year, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths. In 2017, there were 70,237 overdose deaths. 
So the national figures show that the two-month toll of coronavirus deaths exceeded the year-long number of drug overdose deaths in both 2017 and 2018.
The same was true for New York state. There were 21,964 coronavirus deaths in New York state between the start of April and the end of May, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That compares to 3,697 drug overdose deaths for all of 2018 in New York state and 3,921 in 2017.
Our ruling
Wallace said that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.
She’s correct. Nationally, more than 96,000 Americans died of the coronavirus in April and May 2020, compared to a bit more than 70,000 Americans who died of drug overdoses in the higher of the two most recent years, 2017.

Michael Dougherty","How the Utah Jazz got 58 coronavirus tests when US testing is sluggish




If Your Time is short





After Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the state of Oklahoma administered tests to 58 people in a matter of hours.


A spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Health said it was the first incident where that many people met the criteria for testing in such a short timespan.


It’s hard to say how many tests are available and how many have been run, but one tally shows some states testing fewer than 50 people per day as of March 12.





See the sources for this fact-check




The novel coronavirus reached the NBA this week, with Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert testing positive in Oklahoma City moments before the Jazz were set to tip off against the Thunder.
The development led the NBA to suspend its season. The Jazz said in a statement that after diagnostic tests were administered to team players, staff and traveling beat reporters, only one of the reported 58 people tested in connection with Gobert — guard Donovan Mitchell, who confirmed his positive test on Instagram — was found to be carrying COVID-19.
The Jazz’s quick access to 58 coronavirus tests seemed at odds with the fact that the United States has lagged behind other countries where testing has been more widespread. 
""Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58?"" said Michael Dougherty, a senior writer for the National Review, in a March 12 tweet.
 
We wondered how the Jazz team personnel got their hands on COVID-19 tests in a matter of hours, and what kind of access states have had to testing by comparison.
We found that Dougherty’s claim lined up with the information that’s available, despite some murkiness around the number of tests that have been conducted across the country.
How the Jazz got tests so quickly
After a sprinting medical staffer alerted referees to Gobert’s confirmed infection minutes before the game was supposed to start, the state of Oklahoma quickly completed tests for 58 people close to the organization who had come in contact with Gobert. 

The results for those 58 people came back within nine to 10 hours, said Andy Larsen, a Jazz beat writer for the Salt Lake Tribune who was tested for having been in recent contact with Gobert.
The process was fast, with medical professionals taking throat and sinus swabs from the team personnel at the arena, Larsen said. ""It really only does take like two minutes,"" he said.
The specimens were then shipped to Oklahoma’s public health lab, where they were tested overnight using test kits provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Jaime Dukes, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Health.
Dukes told us the Oklahoma lab has been running tests since March 6, and that the lab has completed roughly 150 tests since then, including the tests on the Jazz personnel. 
That means many of the tests in Oklahoma were completed in one night. Dukes said that’s because Oklahoma has been following the CDC’s case-definition requirements, which currently say that clinicians should use judgment to decide if a symptomatic patient should be tested.
Clinicians are supposed to prioritize people with serious symptoms, people who are older or have underlying medical conditions, and people who had close contact with a confirmed or suspected coronavirus patient or recently traveled to an affected area, according to the CDC.
""That honestly was the first incident we’ve had where 58 people at one time needed to be tested,"" Dukes said. ""We’ve been meeting the demand, but we are being very clear about our criteria for testing.""
NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Oklahoma health officials directed the Jazz testing without intervention from the NBA, and that there was ""nothing we did to accelerate it.""
But state epidemiologist Laurence Burnsed, speaking at a March 12 press conference, said the NBA has ""policies in place"" that helped Gobert get tested quickly. NBA team trainers regularly monitor players for illness and work with local physicians when needed, Burnsed said.
According to the Associated Press, a number of other NBA franchises are having employees self-quarantine or get tested after coming into contact with Gobert and Mitchell in recent weeks.

By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







How many tests are being conducted per state?
It’s hard to precisely say how many tests the U.S. has administered, in part because the CDC has outsourced some responsibility to states as well as private, academic and commercial labs. There’s no centralized database tracking everything.
Testing in the U.S. was slowed from the get-go by flaws with the government’s early test kits and barriers that have been relaxed but still limit who can get tested. 
Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said March 7 that public health labs have the ability to test a total of 75,000 people. 
He also said 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private labs, with another roughly 1 million on the way and still more to come from other academic and commercial labs.
The U.S. took another step toward increasing its capabilities on March 13 when it gave over $1 million to two companies to develop new, one-hour tests.
It’s not clear that those capabilities are being met, however. 
According to a tracker from the American Enterprise Institute, the different labs running tests throughout the U.S. should have been capable of cumulatively testing more than 25,000 per day, at least as of March 13. (Dougherty is also a visiting fellow at AEI.)
 
Plus, the number of tests isn’t the same as the number of people who have been tested. Not everyone seeking a coronavirus test can get one. Even sick people have been denied.
As of March 12, the CDC’s website said it had tested roughly 3,903 specimens in CDC labs, plus about 9,721 in public health labs across the U.S.’s various states. 
Those numbers, while incomplete, pale in comparison with countries like South Korea, which ramped up testing weeks ago by setting up drive-thru screening clinics.
""Widespread testing was a key component of China and South Korea's response strategy,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Both countries have made significant progress in controlling their outbreaks.""
The U.S. pace has been more sluggish. Dougherty told us his claim could be traced to early March reports from the Atlantic and Buzzfeed News, which said public health labs in states such as Hawaii and Arkansas were capable at the time of running fewer than 50 tests per day.
Dougherty also cited a recent report from Yahoo News, which relied on state and federal data from the COVID Tracking Project, a project of the Atlantic run by reporters and data scientists. 
The project tracks the numbers presented on state government websites to provide a more accurate overall testing count. (While the CDC website highlights the number of specimens tested, the COVID Tracking Project tracks the number of people.)
The Yahoo News article noted that the COVID Tracking Project counted 2,728 people tested by states and the District of Columbia on March 10, for an average of less than 55 per state. Some states tested fewer than 50 that day, according to the project’s tally. The project reported that 2,219 people were tested by states on March 11, or roughly 43 people per state.
 
Our ruling
Dougherty said ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58.""
Oklahoma public health officials quickly completed tests on 58 people who had had recent contact with Gobert, the Jazz’s center, after he tested positive for COVID-19. 
It’s not clear how many tests each state is running per day. But Dougherty’s claim that ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day"" lines up with what had been reported at the time the claim was made.

Greg Abbott","Job openings in Texas match the number of people on unemployment




Gov. Greg Abbott followed 18 other Republican governors on Monday by rejecting federal pandemic unemployment benefits. 
In a press release, a tweet and an appearance on Fox News, Abbott justified the decision by citing two figures that he argued illustrate the state’s post-pandemic economic recovery. First, there are more job vacancies than people receiving unemployment benefits; and second, the number of job openings in the state today is significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.  
""I had the Texas Workforce Commission dig into the numbers and provide me with the numbers, and here they are,"" Abbott told Fox News host Bill Hemmer on Tuesday. ""We now have more job openings than we do people who are on unemployment. We have 60% more job openings today than we did the month before the pandemic hit the state of Texas."" 
Abbott’s decision, which goes into effect June 26, will cut $300 weekly payments to unemployed Texans by ending the state’s participation in the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program. Abbott also ended the state’s participation in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provided self-employed people with aid throughout the pandemic. 
As of March, the unemployment rate in Texas stood at 6.9%, or nearly 970,000 people, which is down from the pandemic high of 13% in April 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Texas Workforce Commission reports that 1,029,890 million Texans are currently receiving unemployment payments; about 31% of them are receiving aid as self-employed workers. 
The state’s withdrawal from the federal benefits programs comes at the urging of business leaders, who said that 60% of Texas businesses were hiring for at least one position and blamed their hiring struggles on the $300 weekly aid payments. But are there more job vacancies in the state than unemployed people, as Abbott claims? And how does the number of job openings today compare to pre-pandemic levels? 
Job vacancies 
The Texas Workforce Commission, which provided Abbott with a job vacancy estimate at his request, explained how they determined this figure.  
According to a spokesperson, the state workforce agency found that a combined 850,000 jobs had been posted to the agency’s two state-run job boards — WorkinTexas.com and MyTXCareer.com. Then, using third-party software, the agency combined this total with the number of Texas job listings posted to private job boards like Indeed and Monster.com. 
""The exact point of the software is to determine the number of jobs without double counting, since most jobs are posted on multiple sites,"" said Workforce Commission spokesperson James Bernsen. 
According to this methodology, there were about 1,022,000 job postings in Texas as of May 11, which is slightly less than the total number of people currently receiving unemployment benefits.  
But the job vacancy total comes with one caveat, Bernsen said. Because a single job posting may have more than one job vacancy associated with it, the total number may be ""a bit deceptive,"" he said. However, the agency didn’t provide an estimate for how this caveat may affect the 1,022,000 total.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Turning to Abbott’s second claim — that the state has 60% more job openings today than in February 2020 — we look again at data from the Texas Workforce Commission.  
Using the same methodology that determined the present number of job openings, the Texas Workforce Commission found that about 645,000 jobs were available across the state’s job boards and private job boards in February 2020. That’s a 58.4% increase between the February 2020 number and the 1,022,000 job vacancies recorded on May 11. 

 
The numbers don’t satisfy critics 
Critics argue that low wages are to blame for employers' hiring difficulties rather than the $300 weekly unemployment payments.  
Rick Levy, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, a pro-labor group, has called Abbott’s analysis too simplistic, and says that these computer-generated statistics ignore barriers to employment people continue to face.  
""A bunch of business people said they wanted this to happen, and that’s why this is happening,"" Levy said. ""And now [the governor’s office is] going back and backfilling their reason with this computerized approach."" 
Abbott said on Fox News that he directed the Workforce Commission to ""dig into the numbers and provide me with"" job market data.
We asked for a copy of this correspondence from the governor’s office but have not received a response. We also asked the Workforce Commission for a copy of the correspondence. An agency official instructed us to file a request under the Texas Public Information Act. That request has not yet been fulfilled.  
""Labor is a commodity, and if there is a shortage of labor, just like when there is a shortage of anything else, then you raise the price on that commodity,"" Levy said. ""There is a shortage because people are unwilling to do it and wages today are historically low. The profits in this economy have been sucked up by the top 1%.""
Our ruling 
Abbott said that there are now more job openings in the state than the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, and that the number of job openings today is 60% higher than the number recorded in the month before the pandemic.  
Based on Texas Workforce Commission methodology, there are 1,022,000 job postings on state-run and privately run job boards, some of which represent more than one job. That should total slightly more than the 1,029,890 Texans on unemployment as of the most recent data.
Furthermore, that 1,022,000 number is indeed about 60% higher than the 645,000 job openings the Texas Workforce Commission counted in February 2020.

If Your Time is short




North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) faces a challenge from Lt. Gov. Dan Forest (R).
In a debate, Cooper said Forest has missed ""almost half"" of the state's Board of Education meetings, while Forest said he'd been to ""almost every one of those meetings.""
Records show Forest has missed 46% of the board meetings held since March 10, when Cooper declared a State of Emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.




See the sources for this fact-check




Lt. Governor Dan Forest thinks he would be a better governor than Roy Cooper.
But Cooper says Forest hasn’t put in the work needed to hold the office. The two went at it on Oct. 14 in North Carolina’s lone gubernatorial debate.
""The Lieutenant Governor is on the state board of education where the state opening plans are discussed and voted on. And while I’m working with them and public health officials, he’s missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic,"" Cooper said.
Forest responded by saying ""I’ve been to almost every one of those meetings, especially every voting meeting. My staff sits in. My education experts and advisors sit in on all of those meetings, we don’t miss a beat on an education meeting. We never have. We’ve always been present at all of them.""
So what’s the truth here? 
We’ll rate Cooper’s statement, since he’s the one bringing up the subject as an attack.
He said Forest has missed almost half of North Carolina’s education board meetings during the pandemic.
As it turns out, Cooper’s claim is almost spot-on.
Attendance record
The Board of Education has not uploaded its meeting minutes since March. So we listened to audio files uploaded to YouTube. Then we asked the North Carolina Department of Instruction for attendance records.
Cooper declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus on March 10, so we’re using that as the start date for the pandemic in North Carolina.
There have been 28 meetings since then, according to Deanna Townsend-Smith, DPI’s director of board operations and policy. Most of them were over an hour long, meaning the board has spent well over 24 hours talking about education policy just in the last eight months.

Forest has missed 13 of the 28 meetings, or 46%.
Forest missed meetings on March 18 and 27. He attended five meetings in a row before missing seven out of 10 from the beginning of May to the end of July. He then missed four in a row between Sept. 3 and Oct. 7.
In some cases, Forest arrived late to meetings but was still counted present. 
""Present does not always mean attendance for the entire meeting, but present at some point and time,"" Townsend-Smith said.
What Forest missed
It’s unclear why Forest missed the meetings. Neither his office nor his campaign responded to questions from PolitiFact this week.
Forest said during the debate that his experts and advisors ""sit in on all"" of the meetings.
Staff members can’t vote. And Townsend-Smith told PolitiFact that board members ""cannot have anyone attend the meeting on their behalf.""
Forest ""may have had someone listening to the meeting on his behalf,"" she said, adding ""however that is not something that is within my purview and you would need to verify that with the LG’s office.""
Forest has downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying the state should reopen schools without a mask mandate. DPI’s records show Forest missed votes that made changes to grading, testing and graduation requirements, set guidelines for remote learning, as well as another vote on grade point averages. 
Our ruling
Cooper said Forest has ""missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic.""
We’re not here to say whether or not Forest should have attended the meetings. However, we can say whether Cooper’s stat is correct.
The state Department of Instruction says Forest has missed 13 of 28 meetings since the pandemic started. That means he’s missed 46% of the meetings. 
That’s close enough to ""half"" for us.

Dan Crenshaw","Did FDA regulations slow testing for the coronavirus?




If Your Time is short




Food and Drug Administration regulations in place since 2004 require labaratories to get an Emergency Use Authorization from the agency to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that haven't gone through the typical clearance process. 
The policy was intended to speed up the process, but researchers reported significant delays between seeking an application and getting approval and these regulations played a role in that.
The FDA has since changed the regulations to allow labs to start utilizing tests before receiving clearance.




See the sources for this fact-check




Accusations about the responsible party behind the United States’ struggle to accelerate coronavirus testing have come from every which way and the blame has fallen, often inaccurately, on the shoulders of different public officials.
In a March 13 tweet, President Donald Trump said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied its testing system for decades but wasn’t prepared for a large scale pandemic, an issue that was complicated by policy changes made by former President Barack Obama. 
U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., retweeted Trump’s remark and added his own comment: ""Trump is once again trying to blame the previous administration for the number of tests available. This is his #DailyLie."" 
U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, retweeted Schumer’s remark and said: ""It’s not Obama’s fault and it’s not Trump’s fault. We have stringent FDA regulations, long in place, that created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly.""
PolitiFact looked at a different Trump claim blaming Obama for a lack of testing and rated it False. We also looked at a Mostly False claim from Democrat Joe Biden about the Trump administration rejecting tests from the World Health Organization (they were never offered). Trump also inaccurately stated that any individual who wants to be tested for the coronavirus can get a test — we rated that statement Pants on Fire.
We wanted to dig deeper into Crenshaw’s claim, which attributes the delays in the availability of widespread testing to Food and Drug Administration regulations.
Justin Discigil, spokesman for Crenshaw, pointed to articles from ProPublica, the New Yorker, The Atlantic and the Washington Post, all of which highlighted the role FDA regulations played here.
He added: ""Just to be clear – nowhere did we say that these regulations were the sole/only reason for the testing issue, we said that they created barriers.""
A timeline of events
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States came at the end of January, when a man in Washington state developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan. 
One month later, federal health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was inevitable that the U.S. would experience a spread of the virus and urged people to take precautions.
In these early days of the virus, tests were not widely distributed to local and state laboratories. Instead, testing for the new coronavirus was conducted almost entirely by the CDC — samples collected at the local level were sent to the agency.
Initial test kits developed by the CDC for use in local and state labs were flawed and produced inaccurate results in some labs, meaning they couldn’t be distributed. As the agency worked to correct the tests, health officials turned to the FDA. 
The U.S. Association of Public Health Laboratories submitted a letter asking the agency to use ""enforcement discretion"" and authorize local and state labs to develop and use their own tests.
During a public health emergency, labs and drug manufacturers must seek an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that have not gone through the typical clearance process — to share them faster in the emergency.
(These authorizations were begun in 2004 under President George W. Bush.)

By Tom Kertscher • June 15, 2021







For laboratory-developed tests, like the ones in question, FDA policy has stated that they cannot be used in clinical diagnoses without the FDA’s approval during an emergency. 
Although the goal of these regulations is to ensure only accurate lab tests are conducted, health officials have said they prevented them from quickly responding to the virus.
One doctor in a Seattle lab described the process for getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA and said the agency asked for a level of testing that didn’t make sense in the context of an emergency, according to a GQ profile.
A doctor in North Carolina told NBC News that she had developed a test using the World Health Organization’s protocol but had yet to receive the use authorization from the FDA, putting the state ""way behind"" in its ability to test patients. 
On Feb. 29, the FDA announced a change in the process: Labs would still need to seek the agency’s approval for their tests, but the labs could begin testing while waiting for the official green light.
On March 16, (three days after Crenshaw made his claim) the FDA announced another change to its policies and put state officials in charge of coronavirus tests developed by laboratories in their states, meaning labs would engage with state officials and not the FDA. It also removes the requirement for these labs to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization for their tests.
The changes also expand which labs and manufacturers are included in FDA guidelines and which kinds of tests can be developed.
""We believe the unprecedented policy set forth in today’s updated guidance, which addresses laboratories and commercial manufacturers, will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the number and variety of diagnostic tests, as well as available testing capabilities in health care settings, and reference and commercial laboratories,"" reads a release from the agency.
After the changes
After the FDA announced changes to its policies, Labcorps and Quest Diagnostics both announced plans to start testing for the new coronavirus, crediting changes in federal policy with their ability to do so. 
""We applaud the FDA for providing the flexibility for innovative, quality lab developed tests to be brought to patients and providers quickly to advance effective response to the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Steve Rusckowski, chairman and chief executive officer of Quest Diagnostics, in a statement.
But even as state and local authorities move to ramp up testing, the number of available tests is still lacking. 
In Austin, for example, there is still a gap between available test kids and demand for testing, as officials prioritize testing for health care workers, people living in nursing homes and people at high risk for complications from the virus.
Our Ruling
Crenshaw said in a tweet that longstanding FDA regulations ""created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly"" for the coronavirus.
Crenshaw’s statement is accurate. FDA procedures adopted in 2004 meant laboratories had to seek the agency’s approval before developing and using tests in communities, a policy many health care officials have said prevented the country from taking early action in response to the novel coronavirus.
It is important to keep in mind that other factors have contributed to the low levels of testing for the virus, beyond the FDA regulations.

Chris Larson","Yes, Republicans could end Evers’ state of emergency anytime




If Your Time is short





Republicans are again blasting Evers after he declared his third state of emergency  of the pandemic, extending the mask mandate.


But state law lets the Legislature end any emergency order with a simple majority vote, and Republicans control both the Senate and the Assembly.


The Senate leader has said he has the votes to defeat an emergency order, but Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has chosen not to convene his branch.





See the sources for this fact-check




The latest state of emergency declared by Gov. Tony Evers — his third since the start of the coronavirus pandemic — elicited the expected reaction from Republicans.
The latest order extended the state’s mask mandate, which was set to expire Sept. 30, for an additional two months.
An avalanche of GOP news releases and social media posts condemned Evers, a Democrat, calling the order ""illegal,"" ""unconstitutional,"" an ""overreach"" and a ""power grab."" Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester,  called it ""rule by fiat"" and said there would ""undoubtedly be additional court challenges"" — on top of the court challenges to previous orders.
But one Wisconsin Democrat says Vos has no reason to wait on court challenges.
""Whenever you see a WI Republican bemoan the Governor's mask mandate, remember these 2 things,"" state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee said Sept. 23, 2020 on Twitter. ""1) They have the power to overturn the order by joint resolution and they refuse to do it. 2) They sued to have control over our #COVID19 response months ago, and have done nothing.""
We’re focusing on the first point. It’s an overlooked element of the partisan showdown over Wisconsin’s coronavirus response.
And Larson is exactly right. Republicans could end Evers’ order any time, if they got a majority vote in the chambers they control.
Let’s review what's going on.
The state of emergency statute
State law first gave the governor authority to declare a state of emergency in 1951, though that was related only to acts of war. The circumstances in which an emergency may be declared and the governor’s powers in that scenario have evolved since, including the addition of public health emergencies in 2002.
The only prior public health emergency in state history came in 2009, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle issued Executive Order #280 in response to H1N1 (swine flu), according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau.

The section of statute Evers relied on for his three orders isn’t a long one, so here’s the whole thing. We’ve bolded the key element at the end:
Declaration by governor. The governor may issue an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the state or any portion of the state if he or she determines that an emergency resulting from a disaster or the imminent threat of a disaster exists. If the governor determines that a public health emergency exists, he or she may issue an executive order declaring a state of emergency related to public health for the state or any portion of the state and may designate the department of health services as the lead state agency to respond to that emergency. If the governor determines that the emergency is related to computer or telecommunication systems, he or she may designate the department of administration as the lead agency to respond to that emergency. A state of emergency shall not exceed 60 days, unless the state of emergency is extended by joint resolution of the legislature. A copy of the executive order shall be filed with the secretary of state. The executive order may be revoked at the discretion of either the governor by executive order or the legislature by joint resolution.
So, revoking the order is a pretty straightforward process. And one way to do it is a joint resolution approved by both houses. What’s more, unlike traditional legislation it is not subject to the governor’s veto — a simple majority is enough.
The status of the Legislature
Republicans hold a commanding majority in both houses. The advantage is 18-13 in the Senate and 63-34 in the Assembly (with two vacant seats in each chamber).
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said back in July that Senate Republicans had the votes and ""stand ready"" to overturn the first emergency declaration and mask mandate.
That put the onus on Vos, who said in his Sept. 22, 2020, statement, ""No one branch of government can rule outside the letter of the law and go unchecked, even during a pandemic."" But Vos has not taken action to be that check.
It’s unclear whether Assembly Republicans are fractured on the issue, or if other political considerations are at play — such as not wanting to put members on record with a vote in the midst of a volatile election year. A Vos spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
State Sen. Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, even issued a statement criticizing the inaction of Vos and others in his party, saying Vos ""has enabled the continuing illegal conduct of Governor Evers in issuing repeated emergency declarations and a failed statewide mask mandate."" 
Our ruling
Larson said in a tweet that the Republicans who control the Legislature ""have the power to overturn the order by joint resolution and they refuse to do it.""
That’s correct. Republicans have the majority in both houses and the power under state statute. Whatever the reason, they have not acted to end the governor’s state of emergency and accompanying mask mandate.

The coronavirus has hit the African American and Hispanic community particularly hard. In New York City, for example, the death rate for African Americans is double the white death rate.
In an interview on CNN, Desiree Rogers, CEO of the cosmetic firm Black Opal Beauty and former social secretary in the Obama administration, said the jobs black people do put them more at risk.
""We know that only 20% of African Americans had jobs where they could work from home,"" Rogers told CNN June 10. ""What does that tell you? They don't have the capacity to be able to work from home. They have service jobs, and so that means they have to be out.""
Social distancing under COVID-19 thrust millions of workers into telework. Rogers’ stat that only one in five African Americans were able to exercise that option is accurate.

According to the latest survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 19.7% of African Americans could work at home. The fraction was even lower for Hispanics — about 16%. The option to work at home was available to 30% of whites and 37% of Asians. The figure for all workers is 28.8%.

Economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics said their survey doesn’t show why the numbers play out the way they do, but they pointed to government data on race and ethnicity and type of job.
Black Americans represent a bit over 12% of all workers, but are 26% of workers in health care support occupations, a field that includes hospitals and nursing homes. Those are places of high risk for exposure to the coronavirus. 
There are other reasons why the virus has a disproportionate impact on African Americans, including underlying health conditions and less access to health care.

Rogers said that only 20% of African Americans have jobs where they could work from home. That’s pretty much exactly what government data show.

National shortages of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment have exacerbated concerns that U.S. doctors and nurses are not getting the supplies needed to help COVID-19 patients.
The surging demand for masks led President Donald Trump to charge, without evidence, that the equipment earmarked for New York’s hospitals has been ""going out the back door."" But some people are pointing the blame back at Trump, who downplayed the threat of the virus early on despite warnings from experts about the health care system’s readiness. 
One claim we’ve heard from politicians, TV commentators and social media users is that the U.S. gave away medical supplies that are now sorely needed at home.
""On February 7, the (World Health Organization) warned about the limited stock of PPE,"" said a March 31 Facebook post, using an acronym for personal protective equipment. ""That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China. Now our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.""
The post from Blue Dem Warriors was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the information is largely accurate.
The State Department announced on Feb. 7 that it had ""facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.""
The Facebook post cited as its source of information a CNN editorial criticizing the shipment.
The move came more than two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected in Washington state on Jan. 21. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Feb. 7 that the delivery would ""help save lives"" in China, which had reported more than 31,000 cases by then. 
 
Pompeo touted the assistance again in remarks to reporters on March 31, saying it was an example of American generosity and part of an effort to keep the virus contained to China.
The materials sent to China, Pompeo said, were donated by Samaritan’s Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other private organizations. Boeing and Intermountain Healthcare were also involved, according to a Feb. 15 State Department press release.
On Feb. 7, the State Department also pledged to commit up to $100 million in existing funds to assist China and other countries. A State Department spokesperson told us the $100 million promise has been fulfilled with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The U.S. aid to date also includes about $110 million in humanitarian assistance for up to 64 different countries and roughly $64 million in refugee-related assistance for the United Nations. 
The spokesperson told us the security and health of Americans comes first, but that ""the spread of COVID-19 is a threat to our shared international security"" and that efforts aimed at responding to the virus abroad are also meant to help mitigate the spread in the U.S. 
We won’t weigh in on whether the distribution of donated protective equipment to China was the right move. But the Facebook post is correct that the U.S. announced the delivery in February. Other fact-checkers said the same about a similar claim from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
The Facebook post also notes that the timing of the China shipment coincided with a press conference in which the World Health Organization sounded the alarm about a ""limited stock"" of personal protective equipment. 
That’s accurate. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Feb. 7 of a potential supply shortage across the globe and especially in China. The warning was for the world, not the U.S. in particular.
""The world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment,"" Ghebreyesus said. ""Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher.""
Ghebreyesus said the situation was made worse by people outside of patient care using masks, for example. He said health workers and caretakers should be first to receive items from the limited stock, and that health workers in China needed ""the bulk of PPE supplies.""
""WHO discourages stockpiling of (personal protective equipment) in countries and areas where transmission is low,"" he said.
The Facebook post closes by saying ""our health care workers are dying because of no PPE."" 
News reports indicate that some health workers — who are at an increased risk of exposure — are among the more than 200,000 infected Americans and over 4,500 who have died. Doctors and nurses have made shortages known and are tweeting the hashtag #GetMePPE.
Some medical supplies are now coming into the U.S. from abroad. The White House arranged for the transport of tons of equipment from China, and the New England Patriots recently lent its team plane to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks from China for Massachusetts’ health workers.
We asked the State Department whether any of the donated materials sent to China in February made their way back to the U.S., and whether the donations would have gone straight to U.S. hospitals had they not been shipped overseas. We didn’t get answers to those questions.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said: ""On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.""

• A look at the data from the end of March to mid-May confirms that the per capita infection rate in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties was typically in the bottom one-third of counties in the state.
• By contrast, the other two counties in western New York, Erie and Niagara, were consistently in the top half of counties for infections per capita.



See the sources for this fact-check




As New York state began implementing a regional approach to reopening after coronavirus-related shutdowns, a lawmaker from western New York complained that many of his constituents faced a longer wait to reopen because they were geographically linked to more hard-hit counties. 
State Sen. George Borrello, who made the comments in a statement on May 11, represents New York’s 57th district, which includes three less-populated counties — Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua — south of more heavily populated regions near Buffalo (Erie County) and Niagara Falls (Niagara County).
""While infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our linkage with Erie County and its higher infection rates means that we don’t meet the metrics for reopening, and our hurting, rural economies must remain shut down for at least another two weeks,"" Borrello said in the statement.
The state’s reopening plan allowed regions to begin Phase 1 of the reopening process on May 15 as long as they met seven metrics established by the state. The Western New York Region subsequently met all seven metrics on May 18 and entered Phase 1 the following day.
But we wondered whether Borrello was correct in his May 11 statement that the infection rates in the three rural counties was substantially lower than those of the more urbanized counties to the north, and consistently among the state's lowest.
We used the county-by-county infection tallies posted on Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pressroom page and converted them to a rate per 10,000 residents. We ranked the counties from the highest to the lowest for each week from March 30 to mid-May, when Borrello made his statement.
We found that, as Borrello had said, Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties ranked low in infection rates consistently over that period, while Erie and Niagara started higher and continued to rise:

Our analysis found that Chautauqua never ranked higher than sixth from the bottom for infection rates among the 58 New York counties for which data was available, and Chautauqua had the lowest rate of any county for much of the period.

Allegany and Cattaraugus ranked marginally higher than Chautauqua, but well below Erie and Niagara. 
Overall, the three small counties usually ranked in the bottom one-third of counties in the state, and by the time Borrello made his statement, they were all in the bottom one-fifth of counties. By contrast, Erie and Niagara were consistently in the top half of counties as measured by infections per capita.
New York City (including all five boroughs) ranked at or near the top for the entire period.
The state reopening plan mirrored what many other states are doing, with certain types of non-essential businesses opening in phases in each of 10 regions, as long as certain health measurements are met in the region.
Borrello said in an interview that he just wants sensible reopening policies that are implemented ""fairly and equitably.""
""Even though the infection rates are higher in Erie County than the rest of the region, we’re still talking about keeping those same precautions and ensuring that they’re being adhered to,"" he said.

A new Trump administration directive targeting international students at U.S. colleges is being challenged by universities in court — and by pundits on the cable news channels.
The new Immigration and Customs Enforcement guidance would bar foreign college students from staying in the country if they take all their courses online.
International students enrolled at Harvard University and other U.S. colleges that have moved fall-semester classes entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic will have to leave the U.S. or transfer to a school with in-person teaching, according to the new rule.
The rule, if put into effect, could trim the number of foreign students in the U.S. and at specific universities. It could also deal a blow to the U.S. economy, said MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who argued on his primetime TV show that the policy has ""no upside.""
""Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors,"" Hayes said, while displaying a chart on U.S. education exports. ""Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, (in the) 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy.""
Hayes’ statistics are accurate. In 2019, U.S. service exports from education totaled roughly $44 billion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That made education the sixth largest service export for the year, behind services such as personal travel and professional and management consulting, a spokesperson for the International Trade Administration said. 
Academic experts and representatives from nonprofits focused on international education also backed Hayes’ claims. An ICE spokesperson said Hayes’ statement was accurate but declined to comment further due to pending litigation.
""Higher education is one of the few areas in which we have a big surplus of exports over imports,"" said Dick Startz, professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote about the economics of education in a 2017 article for the Brookings Institution.
Education as an export
All three of the statistics Hayes cited are correct. 
More than 1 million international students studied at U.S. institutions during the 2018-19 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education and NAFSA: Association of International Educators, two nonprofits dedicated to international education.
The two organizations reported that those international students contributed more than $40 billion to the U.S. economy during the year. Experts said higher education can be considered an export because international students pay their tuition and living expenses to colleges and universities using money from abroad.

""International students are buying an American education,"" Startz said. ""Hence it’s an export.""
Exports from education amounted to roughly $44 billion in 2019, up from about $42.6 billion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s more than the U.S. made from exporting many other goods and services in the same timeframe. 
Education ranked sixth among service exports in 2019, the International Trade Administration spokesperson told us. It was fifth in 2018.
Those numbers make sense when you factor in the cost of college, said Judith Scott-Clayton, professor of economics and education at Columbia University’s Teachers College.
""If there are 1.1 million international students in the country, and each of them spends about $40,000 on U.S. tuition and living expenses, that gets you to $44 billion,"" she said.
In an email to PolitiFact, Hayes also cited the International Trade Administration and an article in the New York Times Magazine in which an Institute of International Education adviser was quoted saying ""higher education is one of America’s biggest exports.""
But the article said U.S. schools were losing their international appeal for a number of reasons, including rising tuition costs and various policies enacted under President Donald Trump.
Rachel Banks, NAFSA’s senior director for public policy and legislative strategy, said in a statement that new international student enrollment is down over 10% since the fall of 2016, a trend NAFSA estimates has cost the U.S. economy $11.8 billion.
""That’s before the impacts of a global pandemic and related travel restrictions, several presidential proclamations targeting immigrants and nonimmigrants, and this guidance,"" Banks said. ""Therefore, we don’t anticipate this downward trajectory to reverse itself anytime soon.""
Our ruling
Hayes said, ""Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors. Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy.""
Government agencies, academic experts and nonprofit organizations said Hayes’ statistics are correct. The money the U.S. gets from foreign students studying at its colleges and universities makes education one of the country’s top service exports.

M.J. Hegar","How many Texans can’t access health insurance coverage during the pandemic?




If Your Time is short




The latest data on health insurance coverage shows that in 2018 about one in five Texans was uninsured, as Hegar said.
The number of Texans who ""don't have access"" to insurance coverage during the pandemic is harder to pin down, but her “nearly 1 in 3” remark reflects the latest available estimate.




See the sources for this fact-check




After a primary campaign extended by the coronavirus, MJ Hegar was selected by Democratic voters in Texas to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in November.
Hegar celebrated her primary election win with a virtual victory party hosted on Facebook, with appearances from state officials and members of the Texas Democratic Party.
During the event, Hegar talked about the coronavirus and its impact in Texas, stating that ""we had a health care crisis in this state before COVID-19.""
""Before the pandemic, nearly 1 in every 5 was without access to health care coverage,"" Hegar said. ""And now: 1 in 3. Nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance because of the record unemployment and because of our health care model that is failing Texas.""
Texas consistently ranks as the state with the highest uninsured rates, but is Hegar right about the number of people without insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic?
Pre-pandemic insurance levels
Hegar’s campaign shared multiple news articles about Texans without health insurance published before and during the pandemic, including recent reporting from the Houston Chronicle highlighting how job losses are leading to a growing population of uninsured Texans.
Let’s start with the rate of uninsured Texans before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Kaiser Health Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization, publishes state health facts using detailed data from the Census Bureau, including the insurance status of people under 65 in Texas.
More than 4.8 million people under 65 are uninsured — about 19.9% of the population that age, or about 1 in 5 people, according to the latest Census Bureau data published in 2019.
Of those Texans who are insured, about 66% are covered through their employer and 21.6% are covered by Medicaid.
Texas is one of 13 states that has not expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which allows people between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (considered middle class) to receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance plans purchased through an online marketplace.
The act also grants free coverage under Medicaid to anyone earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level (which this year is $26,200 for a family of four) in states that have opted to expand the program.
Since Texas has not expanded the program, eligibility requirements for the program are more strict and are not based solely on income. In order to qualify, a person must have an annual income below a certain threshold ($51,876 for a family of four) and be pregnant, be a parent or caretaker of children, have a disability or a family member with a disability or be 65 years or older.
Pandemic insurance levels
Since Texas first shut down segments of the economy to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the unemployment rate has fluctuated, spiking to a record 13.5% in April before falling to 8.6% in June.
For comparison, in June of 2019 the unemployment rate in Texas was 3.4%.

In May, the Kaiser Health Foundation released a report estimating the number of people losing job-based health insurance coverage during the pandemic and how many of those individuals are eligible for coverage through Medicaid or through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace tax credits.
Nationally, the report estimates that as many as 26.8 million people will become uninsured, including workers, adult dependents and children. Of those, the report estimates that half are eligible for coverage through Medicaid and others through tax credits.
In Texas, that report estimates that 1.6 million people will lose insurance coverage, which would bring the state’s uninsured rate to about 26.5% for people under 65 — or about 1 in 4 people without health insurance coverage.
But these figures don’t speak exactly to Hegar’s claim, which is about the number of people who ""don’t have access to insurance."" 
Even though Texas has opted not to expand Medicaid coverage to people with incomes below the poverty line, the report states that unemployment benefits and the temporary $600 weekly payments approved by Congress are likely to push annual income for many of these unemployed workers to levels that would make them eligible for Medicaid coverage in Texas.
This means they will be able to access Medicaid coverage and marketplace tax credits for the remainder of the calendar year.
Other people who lose coverage could switch to insurance offered through a spouse’s or parents’ employer and others may qualify for coverage but opt not to enroll, according to the report.
So even though an estimated 1 in 4 Texans will now be without health insurance coverage, the actual number of people who are uninsured and ""don’t have access to healthcare insurance"" is likely even lower.
A July report from Families USA, a research and advocacy non-profit that supports policies that make healthcare more accessible, offers a closer estimate. 
The report tried to pin down the number of uninsured adults who would be unable to obtain new health insurance coverage after losing employment during the coronavirus pandemic.
The report estimates that about 5.4 million people across the country became uninsured after losing their jobs between February and May of this year and could not find new coverage.
In Texas, an estimated 659,000 adult workers lost insurance coverage after losing jobs and could not find coverage elsewhere, bringing the rate of uninsured adults in the state at the end of May to 29%, or about 1 in 3 adults, the report found.
But these figures are just about workers, and don’t account for children and other dependents who may have been covered by another adult’s health insurance plan through an employer, which means the total number of people who are uninsured is likely higher than this estimate.
Our ruling
Hegar said 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now ""nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance.""
Hegar is right about how many Texans under 65 were previously uninsured. The number of Texans without access to health insurance during the pandemic is harder to pin down, but her ""nearly 1 in 3"" remark reflects the latest available estimates.

JB Pritzker","Yes, conservatives did share false post about Pritzker’s daughter




If Your Time is short




The false claim Pritzker is referencing is based on a photograph of 14 individuals gathered around a restaurant table, none of which are identifiable as his daughter.
It was spread by gossip and parody accounts on Twitter before being picked up by a website operated by a company that accepts money from partisan groups.
That company is run by a conservative talk show radio host whose co-host later repeated the claim on-air.
Two GOP state lawmakers also shared the post on social media.




See the sources for this fact-check




While explaining why his family would not be together celebrating Thanksgiving this year, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker blasted online accusations that his daughter broke COVID-19 protocols at a restaurant gathering.
""A parody Twitter account posted a picture of a group of individuals eating outside a Chicago restaurant, supposedly breaking the COVID rules the city put in place,"" Pritzker said at a Nov. 17 press conference. ""And the person posting the photo claimed one of the people in it was my daughter.""
""My office put out a statement making clear this wasn’t my daughter,"" Pritzker said. ""But that didn’t stop Republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks from telling people that the picture was of my daughter, despite knowing that this was a lie.""
Pritzker said his teenage daughter, Teddi, was in Florida with his wife, and would ""remain there indefinitely"" because she had started receiving ""hateful and threatening messages.""
Teddi is not identifiable among the group of 14 diners in the published photo. So we decided to find out where the misinformation came from and who had shared it. What we learned shows the governor was correct about how the rumors spread.
The photo was originally shared on Twitter by an account called @deuxmoiworld, according to a thread written by Pritzker’s chief of staff, Anne Caprara. That account links to a website that describes it as a purveyor of ""rumors and conjecture."" By the time we checked it, the image was deleted and the account’s operator had apologized for sharing it.
But the image was already being spread on other Twitter accounts, Caprara documented in her thread, including one that described itself as ""a parody account.""
Then a website with connections to conservative political operatives called Chicago City Wire picked it up, publishing a post based solely on the parody account’s tweet. That account’s tweets are now private. The story does not say which person in the photo is purportedly Pritzker’s daughter nor what date the photo was taken, though servers in the background are wearing masks.
Chicago City Wire is produced by Local Government Information Services, a company run by conservative radio talk show host Dan Proft, state records show.
In October, Proft was featured in a New York Times investigation into a nationwide string of local sites that purport to be news sites, but are instead vehicles for stories ordered up by GOP groups and corporate PR firms. In 2015, Proft teamed up with another controversial internet entrepreneur, Brian Timpone, to start a chain of such publications in Illinois.
Proft and Timpone did not respond to requests for comment.
Following complaints to the Illinois Board of Elections about political funding behind the Illinois sites, the Times reported, a disclaimer on their ""About"" pages now says they are funded, ""in part, by advocacy groups who share our beliefs in limited government."" That disclaimer now appears on Chicago City Wire.
We confirmed with Pritzker’s office these were the websites he was referring to as ""propaganda publications.""

Propaganda includes ""ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause,"" according to Merriam-Webster. While there’s room for disagreement about the perimeters of the term, Pritzker’s use of it to describe these sites is reasonable in light of the New York Times’ findings.
Pritzker’s spokeswoman also pointed to Proft’s radio show, Chicago’s Morning Answer to explain his reference to ""radio shock jocks"" sharing the story.
On the Nov. 13 episode of the show, a listener called in to ask co-host Amy Jacobson and a guest host if they would confront the governor about City Wire’s story.
Jacobson dismissed that suggestion, but still gave credence to the claim that Teddi was pictured, saying, ""I’m glad that she’s out socializing outside, I’m glad that she’s living and not existing.""
When reached by phone, Jacobson declined to comment for this fact-check.
Several state Republican lawmakers also chose to share the post, backing up the most serious portion of Pritzker’s claim.
""Like I’ve been saying from the beginning, this is how you handle a lockdown!"" Rep. Darren Bailey of Xenia wrote in a Facebook post sharing the City Wire story. Bailey’s post has since been shared by more than 700 of his followers.
Rep. Grant Wehrli of Naperville also retweeted a post from a Twitter user who shared the story. That user has since apologized for spreading false information and deleted her original tweet.
Neither Bailey nor Wehrli responded to email inquiries or calls to their district offices asking why they believed the post was credible.
Our ruling
Pritzker said ""Republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks"" were spreading ""a lie"" about his daughter dining outside at a restaurant with a large group of people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The false claim Pritzker is referring to is based on a photograph of 14 individuals gathered around a table, none of which are identifiable as his daughter.

Public Citizen","Yes, taxpayers have sunk at least $70 million into developing remdesivir




If Your Time is short





When the drug that would come to be known as remdesivir was identified as a possible treatment for the Ebola virus, the Department of Defense paid Gilead to develop it, to the tune of $34.5 million today 


A $6 million grant from the National Institutes of Health was awarded to researchers at the University of North Carolina to speed the development of remdesivir 


NIH also sunk $30 million into the clinical trial to observe how remdesivir acted against COVID-19 earlier this spring  


Both the Department of Defense and NIH are federal agencies whose budgets stem from tax dollars 





See the sources for this fact-check




We may be months — at least — away from a vaccine to protect against COVID-19, but in the meantime the public is turning its eyes to drugs that could be used to treat it. 
Among the first to be lauded as a possible solution was the antiviral drug remdesivir, which attacks the coronavirus to prevent it from making copies of itself and spreading. A clinical trial run in April found that patients who took the drug were more likely to recover from the disease — and do so faster — than patients who took a placebo pill. 
But as excitement about remdesivir amps up, criticism has followed over the price that Gilead Sciences, the drug’s manufacturer, wants to charge for it. 
U.S. insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, will pay $3,120 for a five-day course of the drug, while other developed countries will pay about a third less because they’ll purchase from generic manufacturers to which Gilead has licensed production. 
The move has angered many, including the progressive advocacy group and think tank Public Citizen, which tweeted on June 29, 2020 about the price declaration, writing, ""Taxpayers spent $70,000,000 to develop this drug. It should be in the public domain. Instead, Big Pharma is robbing us blind.""
Parts of the tweet, course, are opinions. But the $70 million claim is stated as a fact.
How much did taxpayers spend to develop remdesivir? 
Let’s dig in. 
Remdesivir’s ties to public funding 
To back up the organization’s claim, Peter Maybarduk, Public Citizen’s Access to Medicine director, sent a May 7, 2020 post published on their site titled, ""The real story of remdesivir.""

Amid the worldwide Ebola outbreak in 2015, the U.S. government partnered with Gilead to identify a drug that targeted the Ebola virus and was successful in blocking the infection in Rhesus monkeys. 
That drug would later come to be known as remdesivir. In 2017, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report noted that an entity within the Department of Defense would cost-share with Gilead for ""continued development of this product,"" noting its antiviral activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses. 
The Department of Defense has spent $34.5 million so far on this effort.  
Also in 2017, the National Institutes of Health issued a $6 million grant to researchers at the University of North Carolina to speed the development of remdesivir.  
And as the novel coronavirus made its way into the world, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of NIH, announced it would funnel $30 million into the aforementioned clinical trial for remdesivir.  
Since the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health are funded through federal taxes, these three payments add up to what Public Citizen claimed.

Public Citizen wrote that taxpayers paid $70 million to develop remdesivir. 
Three separate projects from agencies that are funded by taxpayer dollars, adding up to $70 million, have commenced since 2015.

Multiple studies have suggested mask mandates can lead to a decline in COVID-19 cases. 


Researchers caution that factors like compliance and enforcement should be taken into consideration, but masks have ultimately proven to be an effective tool in combating the virus





See the sources for this fact-check




Masks have once again become a political volleyball in the Wisconsin State Capitol.
Assembly Republicans voted on Feb. 4, 2021 to overturn Gov. Tony Evers’ order requiring people to wear face coverings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 — sealing the deal after the Senate took action a week prior. Evers responded by immediately issuing a new mandate. 
The next day, Democrats in the Assembly introduced legislation requiring masks, a measure that is likely to go nowhere in the GOP-controlled Legislature.
Amid the back and forth, Democrats chastised their Republican colleagues for playing politics with public health and argued masks are necessary to push the state through the final stages of the pandemic.
Among those to speak out was Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz.
""At the end of the day we know mask mandates work,"" the Oshkosh Democrat said in a Feb. 5, 2021 interview on the Wisconsin Public Television program Here & Now. ""There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t.""
Is Hintz onto something? Let’s take a look.
Mask mandates in Kansas 
When asked for evidence to support Hintz’s claim, his office pointed to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kansas Department of Health and Environment that analyzed the impact of mask mandates on Kansas counties.
Kansas’ governor issued an executive order requiring face coverings in public spaces starting July 3, 2020. A state law enacted the month prior allowed counties to opt out of the state mandate, which 81 of 105 did without implementing their own mask rules. 
Researchers found the seven-day rolling average of new daily cases per 100,000 people decreased by 6% in the 24 counties with mask mandates after the governor’s order. In counties without a mandate, COVID-19 incidence increased by 100%. 
The study noted that 13 counties with mask mandates and seven counties without mandates also had other mitigation strategies in place, such as limiting the size of gatherings and how many could eat in restaurants. Still, researchers concluded that ""strategies related to mask use mandates appear to be important.""
""The decrease in cases among mandated counties and the continued increase in cases in nonmandated counties adds to the evidence supporting the importance of wearing masks and implementing policies requiring their use to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2,"" the study stated.

Additional research 
The Wisconsin Medical Society cited the Kansas study in a Feb. 1, 2021 memo to Assembly lawmakers asking them to oppose the repeal. 
The group also referenced research from Goldman Sachs estimating that mandates gradually increase the number of people who ""always"" or ""frequently"" wear masks by about 25 percentage points, and the number who ""always"" wear masks by 40 points.
Another study published in June 2020 found a ""significant decline"" in daily COVID-19 cases in states with mask mandates, with the effect increasing over time. Researchers cautiously estimated that 230,000 to 450,000 COVID-19 cases may have been averted by May 22, 2020 due to the mandates. 
Meanwhile, researchers in Canada found a 25 to 46% average weekly reduction in new cases in the first few weeks after mandates were adopted, while the number of people who reported always wearing a mask in public increased by about 30 percentage points. 
When studying the impact of mask mandates, it’s important to consider whether people follow them and if they’re enforced, said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said it can be difficult to assess mandates individually when they’re issued with other public health guidelines, but he believes the Kansas study offered compelling data on the matter. 
""You could argue that with or without a mandate, people might wear a mask because that’s what they do and the mandate is just confirming what they do,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, an entire county had fewer cases.""
And ultimately, Sethi said, mandates remind people about the importance of wearing face coverings to guard against COVID-19. 
""If we didn’t have mandates, would you expect mask use to go up?"" he said. ""I wouldn’t.""

Tony Evers","Yes, there are just a few Wisconsin school districts still doing largely virtual learning




If Your Time is short





A USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin survey found every school district in the state has at least some in-person learning as of March


Milwaukee Public Schools and the Madison Metropolitan School District are the last districts to remain largely virtual, though both have plans to bring students back in April





See the sources for this fact-check




Wisconsin students, parents and educators shouldered a heavy burden over the past year: A patchwork of in-person, hybrid and virtual schooling as the coronavirus devastated the state.
Last March, Gov. Tony Evers closed K-12 schools in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. A closure meant to last two weeks ended up lasting till the school year’s end, and in the fall, only some returned to the classroom full-time.
Reopening decisions have been fraught with controversy. In Madison, teachers taught outside school buildings in early March 2021 to protest their district’s plan to resume in-person learning, arguing it should have been postponed until staff could get vaccinated.
On the flip side, in early February Republicans in the state Legislature moved to send $66 million in federal aid to schools already holding in-person classes. ""The bottom line is our kids need to be in school,"" state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, said at the time.
Evers has said he wants the decision to reopen to be left up to individual school districts because those officials will best understand how much of a threat COVID-19 poses in their community, a stance in line with Wisconsin’s status as a local-control state.
Appearing on Capital City Sunday on March 14, 2021, the governor said he’s spoken with many superintendents who’ve successfully managed in-person school since last September.
That success depends on class sizes, building ventilation and the landscape of local virus transmission — all factors he said would make it difficult to make a statewide judgment on returning to classrooms.
""There’s still a handful of school districts out,"" Evers said, but added that he’d like to get students back in school.
Is he correct that just a handful of districts are still learning largely online?
Let’s take a look.

However, a USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin survey of Wisconsin’s regional education agencies found that every district currently has at least some in-person instruction, and only the Madison Metropolitan School District and Milwaukee Public Schools remain mostly virtual.
In Madison, only the youngest students have returned to school buildings, while students in grades 3 and up are set to return in phases beginning in April. MPS offers an in-person option for some students with disabilities and could begin bringing others back starting April 12, 2021.
Wisconsin has 12 Cooperative Educational Service Agencies, known as CESAs, that help communicate between the state’s Department of Public Instruction and its 422 school districts. Seven CESA administrators surveyed said collectively, there were 150 districts in their jurisdiction where all students can attend school five days a week. Thirty-nine districts use a blended model, where students are in school part of the week and learn virtually on other days.
Other CESA administrators said they weren’t tracking how many districts were teaching students in-person or blended, but did say all districts were back to some in-person learning.
While some students have been back in the classroom since September, more moved to come back after winter break. Such was the case for the Appleton Area School District, for example, the sixth-largest in the state.
School districts generally have virtual options for students and families who did not feel safe returning to the school building, the survey found.
David Honish, agency administrator of CESA 8 in northeastern Wisconsin, told a reporter that ""you have people almost making the assumption"" that districts aren’t back face-to-face, even when that isn’t the case.
While many districts in his region began the school year virtually or in a hybrid model, most have returned to in-person learning, Honish said, with a few exceptions — including one high school that went virtual for two weeks after a COVID-19 outbreak.
Districts are required to notify their local health department when they learn of at least two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the same building within two weeks.

Jamie Nadler","Convalescent plasma therapy showing promise against COVID-19




If Your Time is short



• At least two Chinese studies have found initial success with convalescent plasma therapy, a technique in which antibodies from recovered coronavirus patients are given to seriously ill patients in order to boost their immune response.
• The authors of these studies emphasize that more research is needed to confirm these results more broadly.



See the sources for this fact-check




As physicians grapple with the best ways to treat patients infected with the coronavirus, one treatment that has gained increasing attention is convalescent plasma therapy.
This therapy involves transfusing blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients into a sick patient. The plasma contains a specific antibody that helps the immune system fight the virus. The idea is to help give seriously ill patients an immune-system boost so they can better fight off the virus.
COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy is considered as an investigational product by the Food and Drug Administration. 
Dr. Jamie N. Nadler, the medical director of quality and patient safety for Buffalo General Medical Center and Gates Vascular Institute in upstate New York, recently told the Buffalo News that there’s some evidence that it could be an effective way to treat COVID-19. 
""There have been small trials and small attempts around the world that seem to have had some degree of success,"" Nadler said. ""So it's worth trying as long as it's done correctly.""
Nadler is right: We found two studies of convalescent plasma therapy that have shown  at least initial promise with COVID-19 patients, although experts caution that more investigation is needed. (Nadler did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)
A brief history of convalescent plasma therapy
Convalescent plasma therapy has a long history. It was developed by Paul Ehrlich and Emil von Behring for treatment of diphtheria, a finding that was recognized in 1901 with the first Nobel Prize for medicine, epidemiologist Dr. Ian Lipkin, a professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told CNBC. 
More recently, it was used against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, an infection with similarities to COVID-19 that emerged in Asia in the early 2000s. 
In one study in Hong Kong during a SARS outbreak, a hospital treated 80 patients with convalescent plasma. Among the treated patients, the study showed a higher discharge rate prior to day 14 of the illness: 58.3% became well enough to be discharged, compared with 15.6% of those who did not receive the treatment.
However, patients suffering from Ebola — a different kind of virus in the filovirus family — did not experience positive results from convalescent plasma treatment.

A study from China in the Journal of the American Medical Association
A Chinese study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, described a study treating five critically ill COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma. All five patients, ranging from 36 to 65 years old, began the study while on ventilators. 
Following the transfusion, the authors reported, four of the five patients’ body temperatures normalized within three days. Other key metrics, including viral loads, improved within 12 days.
The hospital discharged three of the five patients. The remaining two were in stable condition 37 days after the transfusion. 
The authors concluded that this represented an ""improvement,"" but cautioned that the limited sample size and study design precluded ""a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment.""
A pre-publication study from China that has been posted online
Another Chinese study found similar results. It has not yet been peer reviewed but has been published online. 
In the study, 10 patients with severe cases received a dose of convalescent plasma. Within three days, the viral load became undetectable in seven patients, with no adverse effects. In addition, fever, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain disappeared or significantly improved in all 10 patients within one to three days of the transfusion.  
The authors concluded that the therapy was ""well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes"" in severe COVID-19 cases. However, they added, questions on the optimal dose and timing need further investigation.
""Just as COVID-19 has taken us back to classic methods for outbreak containment like isolation, through a novel use we are rediscovering the lifesaving potential of a classic strategy like plasma therapy,"" Lipkin said. 
Experts say that convalescent plasma therapy is promising, but much more work is needed.
""There have not been any breakthroughs recently,"" said Jessica Donington, a professor of surgery at the University of Chicago and chief of the thoracic surgery section. But, she added, ""it all has been going on very quickly,"" with larger clinical trials in the works.

Nadler said that ""there have been small trials and small attempts around the world"" to test convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus patients, and they ""seem to have had some degree of success.""

Dan Forest","How many states have reopened gyms?




If Your Time is short




North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a Republican, is running for governor against incumbent Roy Cooper, a Democrat.
Forest, who has accused Cooper of reopening business sectors arbitrarily, tweeted that North Carolina is one of only four states that hasn't reopened gyms.
Most other states have reopened gyms with restrictions. And in a couple states, gyms opened after a court ruling -- not the governor's orders. But his claim is generally accurate.




See the sources for this fact-check




Gov. Roy Cooper has kept gyms and fitness centers closed during the coronavirus outbreak, drawing criticism from his Republican challenger.
The number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations has been steadily rising in the Tar Heel state, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Cooper has said he worries that the heavy breathing associated with exercise could increase the spread of the virus. But Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, the Republican who hopes to unseat Cooper in November, criticized the governor for picking pandemic ""winners and losers.""
On Monday, Forest said North Carolina is one of only a fraction of states keeping gyms closed.
""Now, 46 states have gyms/fitness centers open - North Carolina is one of four states that does not,"" Forest tweeted. 

Is that true?
Generally speaking, yes. Some states are taking a regional approach to reopening gyms. In those states, gyms are allowed to open in some counties but not others. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina are the only states where governors are keeping gyms closed across the board.
Tracking reopenings
Our review of virus-related executive orders tracked by CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the National Governors Association backs up Forest’s assessment.

Most other states have either reopened gyms with restrictions, or reopened gyms in some areas but not others. For example, in California, gyms are allowed to reopen in all but seven counties.
In Pennsylvania, 54 of the state’s 67 counties had entered a ""green phase"" by June 19, meaning gyms could reopen at reduced capacity. But 13 counties remained in the ""yellow phase,"" meaning their gyms were still closed.
Things are moving a little slower in Washington, where less than half of the state’s 39 counties have entered Phase 3. That’s the phase when gyms can reopen at less than 50% capacity, according to the Seattle Times.
In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer allowed some gyms to open on June 10, while others remained closed because they didn’t meet the state’s qualifications to reopen. But a federal judge recently halted the order, allowing all gyms to open on June 25. They’ll remain closed if Whitmer’s appeal is successful.
A similar situation happened in Wisconsin, too. Gov. Tony Evers didn’t lift his ban on gym operations. The ban was dissolved after the state Supreme Court struck down his stay-at-home order.
Our ruling
Forest tweeted that ""46 states have gyms/fitness centers open"" and that ""North Carolina is one of four states that does not.""
Our review found that North Carolina, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts are the only states where gyms remain closed across the state.

North Carolina Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said ""more than 5,000 North Carolinians"" have died from the novel coronavirus, while ""under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years.""
State records and a CDC spokesman back up her claim.




See the sources for this fact-check




Like many states, North Carolina is tracking a record number of COVID-19 cases this holiday season.
And in an attempt to explain the severity of the illness, the state’s top health official compared coronavirus deaths to data on the flu.
""Sadly more than 5,000 North Carolinians have lost their lives from this virus since our first death on March 12 of this year,"" Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said during a Dec. 1 press conference.
""To give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years,"" Cohen said. ""In just 11 months, Covid has killed more than three times that number.""
Is it true that the coronavirus has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years?
According to the state’s data, yes.
NC Covid-19 deaths
North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services tracks both COVID-19 and influenza deaths.
As of Wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 COVID-19 deaths. DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified. 
The deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments.
The first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12. 
NC flu deaths
The state’s health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu season’s data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test.
PolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate.
Here’s a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season:

Other flu counts
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the state’s health department reported far less.
That’s because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said.
Under the ""flu & pneumonia"" section on the CDC’s flu deaths by state website, ""most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths,"" said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.
Some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by ""many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi,"" said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman.
The year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site. 
If you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said ""there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone – without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER – wonder.cdc.gov).""  
""So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC,"" he said.  
The CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete.
Our ruling
Cohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years.
By the North Carolina health department’s count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade.
Cohen’s claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information.

Veronica Escobar","Texas lags behind other states in coronavirus testing per capita




If Your Time is short




Texas is one of the states that has administered the fewest coronavirus tests per capita. At the time of Escobar's statement, only Virginia and Kansas had tested fewer people per capita than Texas.




See the sources for this fact-check




As state leaders in Texas look to ease restrictions implemented to slow the spread of coronavirus in the state, some people have raised concerns about the number of tests the state has administered.
U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, raised the issue during a webcast with the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute and the Migration Policy Institute on Wednesday.
""Texas, I believe, either is near the bottom or at the very bottom when it comes to testing per capita, so the numbers are probably far greater than what is being reported,"" she said. ""I believe we don’t have an adequate idea of just how many cases and how many deaths are being reported.""
At the time of Escobar’s remark, Texas had administered 216,783 tests for the coronavirus, with 21,069 positive results, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The state was reporting 542 coronavirus fatalities with an estimated 7,341 recoveries.
Escobar’s spokeswoman Elizabeth Lopez-Sandoval pointed to the COVID Tracking Project as the source of Escobar’s claim comparing Texas testing to other states.
The COVID Tracking Project was launched by The Atlantic and tracks and publishes data from each state about testing, deaths and hospitalizations related to the coronavirus. 
Looking at the numbers
With a population of more than 27.8 million in 2018 and 216,783 tests administered, Texas had administered about 777 coronavirus tests per 100,000 people as of Wednesday, ranking 48th among states in testing per capita.
Here’s a look at the five states that had administered the fewest coronavirus tests per capita, as of Wednesday:

Kansas: 20,203 tests, or about 695 per 100,000 residents
Virginia: 60,778 tests, or about 722 per 100,000 residents
Texas: 216,783 tests, or about 777 per 100,000 residents
Kentucky: 36,075 tests, or about 812 per 100,000 residents
Arizona: 56,601 tests, or about 842 per 100,000 residents

The total number of tests administered in Texas is significantly higher than other states at the lower end of the list, but testing per capita remains low.
Here’s how other states with large populations compare to Texas in the number of tests administered per capita, as of Wednesday:

Louisiana: 142,834 tests, or about 3,063 per 100,000 residents

Efforts to increase testing
Public health experts say a dramatic increase in testing is needed to ensure it’s safe to reopen sectors of the economy, as limited testing data means there are significant unknowns when it comes to the scope of the virus spread.
The data that does exist is incomplete, as some private laboratories have not reported the number of negative tests they have administered. And there are clear discrepancies in some county-level data.
For example, one small West Texas county reported 12 positive cases of the virus but only reported administering one test as of April 13, according to the American-Statesman. 
During a news conference on April 17, Gov. Greg Abbott said he spoke with the White House and was told Texas would receive ""a dramatic increase"" in testing — ""not just testing those who may show symptoms, but also being able to test entire communities so that we have better information.""
California and Arizona have both expanded which individuals meet the criteria required for testing, allowing individuals with no symptoms to be screened.
Abbott told reporters that this increase in testing capacity is expected by ""late April or early May.""
He declined to offer specifics, but said new testing will be coming from the private sector.
Texas Department of State Health Services Commissioner John Hellerstedt said the private sector will play a role, but public health authorities also are working to grow their capacity.

Marco Rubio","How Joe Biden’s first executive orders compare with past presidents




If Your Time is short





The total number of presidential directives signed by Biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by Trump and Obama over the same period.


The available record before FDR isn’t complete enough to definitively say whether Rubio is also right about all presidents, but experts said it’s likely that his claim still holds.


It’s worth noting that Biden issued multiple orders directed at a specific issue that’s actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic.





See the sources for this fact-check




Sen. Marco Rubio, R. Fla., claimed that President Joe Biden talks like a centrist, but is ""governing like someone from the far-left.""
""He has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone,"" Rubio said in a video.
Is that true?
Rubio tweeted the video shortly before 8 a.m. Jan. 22, so we evaluated Rubio’s claim based on actions Biden had taken up to that point (Jan. 20-21).
Setting aside the political implications of the word ""fiat,"" we found that available evidence supports Rubio’s assessment: Biden’s use of the executive power in his first two days far outpaced that of his predecessors.
Rubio’s office did not respond to our requests for information.
 

 
Available evidence backs Rubio’s claim
The total number of presidential directives signed by Biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama over the same period.
Biden issued 17 executive orders on his first two days in office, compared with Trump who issued one and Obama who issued two. Biden issued three proclamations, while Trump and Obama each issued one.
Executive orders state how to manage the operations of the executive branch of the federal government. Proclamations communicate information on holidays, commemorations, special observances, trade, and policy.
The Office of the Federal Register numbers each executive order and proclamation consecutively as part of a series and publishes them in the daily Federal Register after the White House sends over the information. Other presidential documents, such as memoranda and notices, are not numbered but are also published.
The Office of the Federal Register is in the process of digitizing documents published prior to 1994. So we were unable to use that source to compare Biden’s actions with all other presidents. We turned instead to the American Presidency Project, a nonpartisan source of presidential documents hosted at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
If Rubio was referring to a president’s first two days in office (instead of any two-day period), the available documents show that he is correct dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose first inauguration was in 1933, said Gerhard Peters, a political science professor at Citrus College and co-director of the American Presidency Project.
The available record before FDR isn’t complete enough to say definitively whether Rubio is also right about earlier presidents, but experts said it’s likely that his claim still holds.
""Before FDR, presidents simply did not charge into office as prepared for action,"" said John Woolley, co-director of American Presidency Project and professor emeritus of political science at UCSB. ""Even Lincoln, judging by the record assembled by (his secretaries John G. Nicolay and John Hay), did not fire off as many orders as Biden despite there already being an active revolt in progress.""
Many of Biden’s executive orders target the pandemic
Rubio used the word ""fiat"" — a politicized term that would suggest Biden rushed in sweeping and long-lasting policy changes. However, Biden in his first two days issued 10 executive orders and one memorandum to address a specific issue that’s actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic. Biden was sworn into office around the time the United States recorded about 400,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Here’s a rundown of those specific actions:
Executive order mandating use of masks on federal property

Executive order to secure supplies necessary for responding to the pandemic
Executive order to ensure equitable pandemic response and recovery

Executive order to protect workers from COVID-19 under the Occupational Safety and Health Act
Executive order establishing the COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board
Memorandum extending federal support to governors’ use of the National Guard in their COVID-19 response
""No one would doubt the need for executive action to deal with an overwhelming health crisis, so this crisis situation makes this a unique point in time,"" said John Frendreis, a professor emeritus of political science at Loyola University Chicago. ""Rubio’s comment is technically correct, although when taken together with the context, it is exaggerated.""
Besides those COVID-19 measures, Biden’s actions included an order requiring an ethics pledge from his appointees and directives revoking several of Trump’s policies.
It’s become more common for presidents to issue executive actions and for the other party to dislike it, said Daniel Gitterman, a public policy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
""When it’s the president of the opposite party, they call it executive fiat, and when it’s the president of the same party, they call it bold action,"" Gitterman said.
According to the Federal Register, Trump signed 220 executive orders during his four years in office. Throughout their eight-year administrations, Obama signed 276 executive orders and George W. Bush signed 291.
Our ruling
Rubio said Biden ""has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.""
Fiats"" is a politically loaded term and ignores that many of Biden’s directives were specific to the ongoing pandemic.
Still, the available evidence on the number of directives issued supports Rubio’s claim.
We rate it True.

Priorities USA Action","Yes, Trump said positive COVID-19 tests are making the U.S. “look bad,” referenced slowing testing




If Your Time is short





As health officials push increased testing as key to managing COVID-19, Trump has increasingly questioned the need for testing.


The president has called testing “overrated” and repeatedly said the high number of confirmed cases makes the U.S. look bad.


He went a step farther at a rally in Oklahoma, saying the U.S. should slow testing as a result. Aides insisted he was joking, while Trump at one point said he wasn’t joking, and at another said he wasn’t serious about slowing testing.


The attack ad in question lays out these quotes in chronological order in a way that is fair to the context where Trump used them.





See the sources for this fact-check




Months into the coronavirus pandemic, much remains unknown about the virus’ origins, transmission and longevity.
But the need for more testing is a point of near unanimous agreement among health officials, scientists and members of both political parties. It’s the pathway to better understanding how far the disease has spread, how common severe cases are and how best to address it.
So is the president pushing to limit testing?
A new attack ad from Priorities USA targeting Wisconsin and other battleground states makes that claim with a series of quotes from President Donald Trump. Over the mandatory ominous music, the ad plays four Trump quotes asserting testing is making America look bad, so we should slow it down.





Ads in this style have been known to pull quotes out of context or rearrange them chronologically to create a more compelling narrative.
That didn’t happen here.
America has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world — with 2.3 million as of June 24, 2020 — and has also done the most testing in the world, in terms of raw numbers. Across the nation we are conducting about 500,000 tests per day now, double where we were in early May, according to covidtracking.com.
That said, many countries have done more testing on a per-capita basis, as detailed by Johns Hopkins University. Throughout the pandemic the U.S. has averaged about 56 tests per day per 100,000 people. Germany, Canada, Spain and Australia have all tested at a higher rate, and Russia and Qatar are among a handful of countries that have topped 100 daily tests per 100,000 people.
Trump has boasted of the volume of testing in the past, saying America’s testing is the best in the world and that the high number of confirmed cases is a ""badge of honor.""
But since May, the president has also increasingly pushed back against testing, calling it ""overrated"" and noting the bad optics associated with the higher case counts. He took that line of reasoning a step farther in his latest comments, as detailed in the ad.
Here are the four quotes in context.
‘By doing all of this testing we make ourselves look bad.’
Trump said this May 6, 2020, during a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The quote
""The media likes to say we have the most cases, but we do, by far, the most testing.  If we did very little testing, we wouldn’t have the most cases. So, in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.""
The context
Reynolds — a Republican — responded to Trump by highlighting the importance of testing: ""That really provides us the data we need to understand the virus activity better."" Trump, meanwhile, has made numerous similar comments, including a June 19, 2020, Wall Street Journal interview where he called testing ""overrated"" and said ""in many ways, it makes us look bad.""
‘When you test you find something is wrong.’
Trump said this May 14, 2020, during an appearance in Pennsylvania.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The quote
""Don’t forget, we have more cases than anyone in the world, but why? Because we do more testing. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases.""
The context
Trump asserts there would be fewer cases if there were less testing. Of course, less testing would simply mean officials are aware of less cases, or there would be fewer identified cases — it wouldn’t mean fewer cases exist. 
But this line of thinking is consistent with other comments from the president, including a May 15, 2020, event where Trump said, ""If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases,"" and ""Maybe it (testing) is overrated.""
""Testing is a double-edged sword. … So I said to my people, slow the testing down please.""
These statements, used separately in the ad, are both from a June 20, 2020, rally in Oklahoma.
The quote
""You know, testing is a double-edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. It’s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. German’s done a lot. South Korea’s done a lot. They called me, they said the job you’re doing (trails off). Here’s the bad part. When you’re testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’""
(Note: The U.S. has conducted more tests than any other country in terms of raw numbers, but the ""20 million … more than anybody else"" is wrong. Russia has conducted more than 17 million tests, according to tallies from Our World in Data)
The context
Various White House officials claimed Trump was speaking in ""jest"", was ""obviously kidding"" or was speaking ""tongue in cheek"" about slowing down testing. Trump himself has responded to this assertion multiple ways.
On June 23, 2020, he was asked specifically if he was kidding about slowing down testing. He responded, ""I don’t kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear,"" then went on to talk about America having ""the greatest testing program anywhere.""
But in an interview that day with FOX News, Trump responded to a question  — ""But you don’t mean, do you mean slow down testing?""  —  by backing away from the statement and reiterating the idea that the U.S. would look better if it tested less. 
""No I don’t mean slow down, but if we did slow down … let’s say instead of 25 million tests we did 5 million tests, we’d be very low in cases right now, and everyone would say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’"" Trump told ""Fox & Friends.""
Dr. Anthony Fauci — part of the national coronavirus task force — said that day in testimony before Congress the federal government is trying to expand coronavirus testing, not slow it down. Fauci told the House Energy and Commerce Committee, ""None of us have ever been told to slow down on testing.""
Our ruling
An attack ad targeting various battleground states quotes Trump as saying testing makes the U.S. look bad, ""so I said to my people slow the testing down.""
Video recordings show he did indeed say these lines, and in the order presented. And the overall impression created by the ad is consistent with Trump’s messaging over the preceding month and a half.
As health officials and politicians alike have pushed for more testing, Trump has expressed increasing doubts as to its importance, progressing from calling it ""overrated"" to calling for the slow down. Though White House officials defended that as a joke, Trump at one point contradicted that, while at another saying he didn’t mean it.

Kelly Alexander","Most NC legislators in 'high risk age group' for coronavirus




If Your Time is short




A Democratic North Carolina House member tweeted that ""most"" legislators are in the high risk age group for coronavirus.
The high risk age group includes people 60 and older.
More than half of NC legislators are in that age group.




See the sources for this fact-check




To prevent the spread of coronavirus, one state lawmaker wants to take the ""assembly"" out of the North Carolina General Assembly.
North Carolina state Rep. Kelly Alexander, a Democrat from Mecklenburg County, suggested on Twitter that legislators should consider video conferencing. The start of the legislature’s session is scheduled for April 28.
Alexander posted his tweet on March 11. That same day the World Health Organization labeled the spread of the novel coronavirus as a ""pandemic,"" prompting a wave of event cancellations and changes across the globe.
""With a vaccine a year in the future the General Assembly should use more teleconferences and fewer in person meetings to cut down on potential exposure...after all most of the GA’s members are in the high risk age group,"" Alexander tweeted, adding: ""besides we need to modernize...just saying.""

Is it true that ""most"" of North Carolina’s legislators are in the ""high risk age group?""
Alexander never responded to an email from PolitiFact, so we don’t know how he came to his conclusion.
Regardless, his tweet is on-point.
At-risk ages
First, let’s first look at what health experts say about the novel coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) and who’s most at-risk. 
The virus causes a fever, cough and shortness of breath in people anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure, according to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says people with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease are most at-risk.
As for age, there’s no specific birth date at which people become more vulnerable. Generally speaking: the older you are, the more likely you are to have complications from the novel coronavirus.
That said, top health organizations have defined ""older adults"" as people who are at least 60 years old.
The CDC has previously, in a document unrelated to the coronavirus, defined older adults as those over 60. The World Health Organization specifically mentioned people over 60 in its recent report on the coronavirus outbreak in China.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Health experts recently told CNN that the term ""older"" typically refers to anyone over 60. And US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said 60 is the ""average age of people who need medical attention.""
It also appears that people older than 60 are more susceptible to complications from the virus.
Scientific American reported that patients in China were more at-risk of death if they developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ARDS, after contracting coronavirus. The average age of those who contracted the syndrome was 61.
State lawmakers
So we know that people who are 60-years-old or older are likely to be more at-risk than other age groups. With this in mind, let’s look at the age of North Carolina’s legislators. 
The legislature includes 170 members: 120 in the House and 50 in the Senate.
In the Senate, 28 members are 60-years-old or older. In the House, 63 members are older than 60.
That means 91 members are aged 60 or older -- which is 53% of the General Assembly.
Those numbers come from James White, the House principal clerk, and Sarah Holland, the Senate’s principal clerk.
So it’s true that a majority of legislators are 60 or older. 
How does that compare to Congress?
In the U.S. House, 197 of its 435 members are 60 or older. In the U.S. Senate, 66 of its 100 members are 60 or older. That means about 49% of Congress is at least 60 years-old.
Those numbers come from a report by the Congressional Research Service and Jennifer Manning, the service’s senior research librarian.
Our ruling
Rep. Alexander said ""most"" North Carolina legislators are in the ""highest risk age group"" for coronavirus.
The highest risk age group is generally people who are aged 60 and older. Alexander’s claim is on-point: more than half of legislators are older than that. We rate his claim True.",Tweet,https://twitter.com/TheNCRep/status/1237938327267000320?s=20,null,,null,

In the earliest days of the coronavirus outbreak, when public officials scrambled to close schools and businesses, a Facebook user lamented the inequity of the quarantine that Gov. Tom Wolf had imposed on Pennsylvanians.
""The poor are, ironically, the most likely to be employed in the industries deemed ‘essential’ while their upper-class peers are freed to bunker down for weeks until the first death wave passes,"" the Facebook user wrote on March 18.
We wondered whether this claim would hold up when we looked at the data.
Starting with Wolf’s executive order forcing all non-life-sustaining businesses to close, we pulled U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics information on the number of Pennsylvania workers in each essential industry and calculated their average annual wages.
The Facebook user is right. The vast majority of life-sustaining workers earn low and working-class wages.
A quarter of Pennsylvania’s essential workers make less than $30,000 annually, and two-thirds make less than the state’s household median of $60,000, raising questions about whether the people keeping the rest of society afloat are being sufficiently protected and compensated.
Grocery stores employ one of the largest groups of workers making the lowest wages. There are more than 120,000 grocery store workers in Pennsylvania, the data shows, and average annual wages for the sector are about $23,000. Gas stations, assisted living centers and building maintenance firms are among the other essential businesses employing large numbers of low-wage workers across the state.
Philadelphia-area grocers including Giant, Acme and Aldi recently started limiting the number of shoppers allowed in their stores at once to protect workers.
Still, across the country, dozens of grocery clerks have already been sickened with the virus. And a Trader Joe’s worker in Scarsdale, N.Y., a greeter at a Giant store in Largo, Md., and two Walmart employees from the same Chicago-area store have died from the coronavirus in recent days.
Acknowledging how vulnerable essential workers are, Wolf recently announced new rules aimed at preventing the virus from spreading in businesses open to in-person customers. Grocery stores must now make all workers and customers wear masks and start taking employees’ temperatures if a worker tests positive.

By Samantha Putterman • June 15, 2021







But even as the state rolled out these new protections, it hasn’t done any more to ensure that the workers Wolf deemed essential are fairly compensated besides asking employers to step up and do the right thing. Wolf called fair pay for essential workers ""the responsibility of the private sector.""
Among the grocers that operate in the Philadelphia area, several chains, including Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Wegmans, Fresh Grocer, Giant Eagle and Acme have started offering workers bonuses or higher hourly wages to their workers because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The second part of the Facebook post addresses the perk the user believes white collar workers have enjoyed since Wolf ordered millions of Pennsylvanians to stay at home – the freedom to work from home.
Federal data from a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey on the share of workers who say they’re able to telecommute shows a stark divide among industries, The Washington Post reported
About 60 percent of people who said they work in ""management, business and financial operations"" said they can work from home. But fewer than 10 percent of workers said they could do so in categories such as ""services,"" ""construction and extraction,"" ""installation, maintenance and repair,"" ""production"" and ""transportation and material moving.""
The Post also found divisions along race and class lines.
Thirty-seven percent of Asian Americans and 30 percent of whites said they could work remotely. But only 20 percent of African Americans and 16 percent of Hispanics said they had that ability. Almost 52 percent of those with a college education or higher said they could work from home, but only 4 percent of those with less than a high school diploma said they could.
Our ruling
The Facebook post stated that the poor are the most likely to be employed in essential industries while workers who earn more are free to shelter at home until the outbreak subsides.
Our data analysis shows that the vast majority of workers Wolf deemed essential earn low and working class wages, and a recent analysis by The Washington Post shows that many white collar workers say they’re able to telecommute. For these reasons, we rate the Facebook post True.

""There will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who’ve had no income interruption whatsoever,"" Toomey (R., Pa.) said Tuesday during a Senate confirmation hearing for Janet Yellen, Biden’s nominee for Treasury secretary.

Together, those payments would total $2,000 per person — the target Democrats in Congress set, Trump made a late and unsuccessful push for, and that Biden is now pursuing from the White House. 
Individuals making up to $75,000 would qualify for $1,400 in new aid on top of the $600 payments they just got. And adults with dependent children ages 16 and younger would qualify for an additional $600 per child. 
Analysts estimate this component of Biden’s plan could cost $465 billion.

During the Senate Finance Committee hearing, which took place the day before Biden’s inauguration, Toomey argued against direct payments for upper middle class families who haven’t endured any loss of income during the pandemic. 
Yellen acknowledged the payments aren’t designed to target the people hurting the most, but rather intended to support families and stimulate the economy broadly. 
""Some families presumably don’t greatly need the money, but there are many families who are under stress,"" Yellen told Toomey. 
The eligibility criteria for direct payments under Biden’s plan mirrors the one Congress agreed to a few weeks ago, which set the upper income limit for the smallest payments at $174,000 for a married couple. 
Toomey told Yellen it would be tough to find bipartisan support for Biden’s proposal, but several Senate Republicans have already endorsed the idea, including Marco Rubio of Florida, Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. 
Democrats were first to pitch the idea of $2,000 per person direct payments, but it was Trump who made a late push for them in December, threatening to withhold his support for the relief package unless the payments were included. He eventually relented and signed the package into law without the larger payments.

Toomey said families with six-figure incomes who’ve had no income interruption will get several thousand dollars in payments under Biden’s coronavirus relief package. That’s right.
