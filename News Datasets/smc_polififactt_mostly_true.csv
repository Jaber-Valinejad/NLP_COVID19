If Your Time is short





Preliminary research indicates that COVID-19 can live for up to three hours in the air, four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and three days on plastic and stainless steel.


Health officials advise people to wash their hands regularly, avoid touching their faces and disinfect their homes daily to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The No. 1 thing Americans can do to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is wash their hands. That’s because you can contract the virus by touching surfaces that have the respiratory droplets of an infected person on them.
But how long can coronavirus germs live on those surfaces? An infographic from KIRO-TV in Seattle offers some clarity.
According to the graphic, which was published March 18 on Facebook, the coronavirus can live for ""up to 3 hours in the air, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the latest research backs it up — so keep washing your hands and disinfecting your home.

The graphic cites an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17. Researchers tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard.
""SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),"" the authors wrote. ""SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.""
Aside from air, the worst surface for the virus is copper; researchers could only detect viable virus particles there for up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel — up to three days.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







It’s worth noting that the article is not a peer-reviewed study, and researchers tested the lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab setting. But their findings reflect what others have found about the potential longevity of the coronavirus outside the body.
 
An article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about how long human coronaviruses can survive on different surfaces. The authors found that viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19, could live for a couple of days on steel, plastic, wood, paper and glass surfaces.
What about money, which many Americans handle every day? The World Health Organization advises people to wash their hands with soap and water after handling banknotes, coins and credit cards.
The Journal of Hospital Infection article says human coronaviruses could live on paper for anywhere between one to five days. The U.S. Dollar is made up of 75% cotton and 25% linen, as opposed to wood pulp, which is the base for most paper.
Still, you’re probably safer handling coins. The New England Journal of Medicine article found that COVID-19 can only survive for up to four hours on copper, which is what quarters, nickels and dimes are primarily made of. Ironically, pennies are made primarily of zinc, although they have a copper exterior.

Roy Cooper","NC governor mostly right about indoor worship and coronavirus




If Your Time is short




N.C. Gov. Roy Cooper faced pushback for loosening restrictions on retail stores but not worship services.
Cooper's reasoning: sitting around others for long periods of time is more dangerous than walking by someone in a store.
While the world's top health organizations haven't compared those exact scenarios, experts generally agree with him.




See the sources for this fact-check




North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper eased pandemic restrictions on retail stores before doing so for churches -- a move that prompted pushback from some members of the faith community.
Non-essential stores and indoor church services were both initially forbidden to operate under Cooper’s stay-at-home order. When Cooper launched Phase One of reopening North Carolina, he allowed some stores to open but didn’t allow churches to hold services indoors.
Experts generally agree that traditional church customs such as singing, passing around bulletins and even sharing food would make worship services especially dangerous during the coronavirus outbreak. But Cooper’s critics argued for a chance to worship while being responsible.
During a press conference on May 12, Cooper said his decision was based on science.
""We know that inside it is much more likely that you’re going to transmit this virus, particularly when you’re sitting or standing in one place for a long period of time, and this is across the board. And some people are trying to compare this with retail. With retail, people are moving around and you don’t have as much a chance to spread the virus (as you do) when people are sitting or standing indoors.""
Since then, a judge’s ruling has enabled indoor church services in North Carolina. A US District Court Judge allowed for a restraining order on Cooper’s rules, and Cooper said he won’t appeal.
Still, we wondered which is more dangerous:


sitting in a building with the same group of people for a prolonged period, or


walking around a building with an ever-changing group of people?


The answer isn’t simple. Is it possible that a church could practice social distancing well enough to prevent virus spread? Yes. Is it also possible that one shopper could linger too long around another shopper who’s infected? Also yes. 
Because of those variables, the country’s top health organizations told us they haven’t compared the two environments enough to say whether one is more dangerous than another. 
However, experts do believe that sitting in one place for a long time does pose a threat -- while shopping usually allows people the physical freedom to avoid someone who might be infected.
Specific comparisons
For this fact check, we reached out to the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is directed by Dr. Anthony Fauci.
None of the groups offered specifics on which scenario is more dangerous.
The WHO doesn’t categorize activities by risk because each scenario ""depends on a range of factors, from the local transmission scenario that is occurring, to prevention measures adopted by individuals to the IPC procedures in place in these public spaces,"" said Ashley Baldwin, a regional spokeswoman.
Fauci’s group responded similarly: ""I’m not aware that this is anything our researchers have explored,"" NIAID spokesman Ken Pekoc said.
The CDC hasn’t compared them either, CDC spokeswoman Kate Grusich said. ""CDC has not compared locations or settings for COVID-19 transmission, so we can’t comment on these questions at this time,"" she said.
But the CDC does emphasize the risk of time spent around other people in close proximity. 
Kelly Haight Connor, communications manager for North Carolina’s health department, responded to PolitiFact questions on Cooper’s behalf. She pointed out several instances where the CDC warns against large gatherings of people.

The CDC’s webpage on social distancing says ""COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period."" The CDC, which acknowledges the ""risk of gatherings,"" also offers guidance for churches hoping to hold services during the pandemic. Recommendations include:


scheduling multiple services, with enough time between each to allow for cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces,


promoting social distancing,


limiting the sharing of materials,


considering holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors.


What experts say
The novel coronavirus travels through respiratory droplets expelled when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. Without definitive studies comparing the likelihood of spread in two environments, we turned to experts for their opinion. 
Karen Hoffmann, the immediate past president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, told PolitiFact that the ability to walk away from someone is key.
And if you do pass someone in an aisle at Target, experts believe you’re less at risk than someone sitting still in a confined space. ""I would not worry about walking by someone,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told Slate. 
""Even in a health care setting, contact is defined by being near someone for a certain amount of time,"" Adalja said. ""I would not worry about these fleeting encounters. The virus isn’t airborne—droplets need to get from one person to another.""
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, told us she generally agrees.
""Reports from indoor spaces (restaurants, offices) suggest that both physical proximity and duration of exposure are important for transmission,"" Rasmussen said in an email. ""So sitting still around others in close physical proximity is probably higher risk than incidentally passing by someone in a store, but the risks aren’t quantified because there are a lot of variables that can impact this.""
A recent NPR article categorized 14 different activities by their level of risk for infection. Worship services? ""High risk."" Going shopping? ""Risk varies.""
""Crowds with high density lead to substantial increase in risk,"" said Dr. William Miller, an epidemiologist at Ohio State University. ""The major mitigating factor is that people don't mingle in a single place for long.""
Churches as hotspots
While churches may be able to mitigate coronavirus spread, there are multiple examples of churches failing to take precautions -- and thus becoming the source of small outbreaks.
A church revival in Hopkins County, Kentucky was linked to at least 30 cases and three deaths, according to The Courier Journal. Officials in California connected 71 cases to one church in a suburb of Sacramento, The Guardian reported.
The Washington Post recently listed several examples in a story about the dangers of worship during the pandemic.
On its Facebook page, the CDC on May 19 used a rural Arkansas church as an example of how fast coronavirus can spread in group settings. The CDC reported that two people with coronavirus symptoms attended the church in early March. 
""Of the 92 church members who attended the gatherings, 35 were later confirmed to have COVID-19, which led to three deaths. Through contact tracing, an additional 26 confirmed cases were identified in the community,"" the CDC’s Facebook post says. ""This outbreak highlights the potential for widespread transmission of COVID-19 during in-person, faith-based events.""
The CDC posted a report on the Arkansas outbreak on its website.
Our ruling
Cooper said shopping isn’t as likely to spread coronavirus as church services because ""people are moving around and you don’t have as much a chance to spread the virus (as you do) when people are sitting or standing indoors.""
The world’s leading health organizations have not offered a risk comparison between shopping and attending a worship service in part because there are so many variables. 
However, generally speaking, experts are definitely less worried about spaces where people can move freely than they are about spaces where people sit near each other for long periods of time.

If Your Time is short





Protesters called on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to relax Michigan’s social distancing requirements.


Whitmer said she will base decisions on how to reopen Michigan on facts and science.


A 2007 study found that amid the 1918 flu pandemic, many cities experienced second waves after ending social distancing.





See the sources for this fact-check




Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home orders prompted conservatives to organize protests, but Whitmer said she will base decisions on how and when to relax Michigan’s social distancing guidelines on facts and science.
At a press conference April 15, Whitmer said that the protests where people gathered without masks in close proximity ""may have just created a need to lengthen it, which is something that we’re trying to avoid at all costs.""
Whitmer said she is working with experts in health care and other sectors to create a data-driven approach to reopening the state. ""I want to be very clear that our decision to re-engage sectors is going to be based on the best facts and the best science, and what facts and science have told us is that re-engaging our state too soon or too fast will lead to a second wave of COVID-19 in Michigan,"" she said. ""During the flu pandemic of 1918, some cities lifted social distancing measures too fast, too soon, and created a second wave of pandemic.""
Whitmer said that as a result of lifting social distancing measures too fast in 1918, many cities had to revert to quarantines and ""suffered a lot of additional deaths."" 
We will explain the source of her data, which comes from an academic paper in 2007. 
Research about social distancing during the 1918 flu
The influenza pandemic of 1918 spread worldwide and killed at least 50 million people, including about 675,000 in the United States. Since there was no vaccine for the virus and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections, control efforts were largely limited to social distancing and quarantines, which were applied unevenly.
During her press conference, Whitmer pointed to a chart by National Geographic, which displayed the findings of a 2007 study about the death rates in 43 cities during the 1918 pandemic. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and written by researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Two of the authors summarized their findings in the Washington Post in April.
""The experience of 1918 also reminds us that early, layered (i.e., more than one at the same time) and lengthy mitigation measures are the best strategy. For social distancing to work, it must be sweeping and enforced across a wide swath of the community,"" wrote Howard Markel and J. Alexander Navarro.
The researchers examined social distancing in 43 cities during about 24 weeks in 1918-19. Public gathering bans typically meant the closure of saloons, public entertainment venues and sporting events. Indoor gatherings were banned or moved outdoors. 
Researchers found that cities that implemented social distancing in a timely and comprehensive manner and sustained those rules suffered the least.
St. Louis, for example, implemented a relatively early, layered strategy that included school closures and the cancellation of public gatherings. It sustained those interventions for about 10 weeks and did not experience nearly as harmful an outbreak as 36 other communities. 
Conversely, Philadelphia held a massive Liberty Bond Parade to bolster the World War I effort. That led to a spike of thousands of flu cases within days. In Atlanta, the mayor sided with the business community and ended closures after three weeks, despite objections from the board of health. The epidemic raged in Atlanta.

Researchers documented public pressure to end social distancing as soon as the flu seemed to peak and ebb. Cities then lifted the measures, and people lined up for movies and packed into dance halls and shopping districts.
""The result? Cases and deaths resurged. Most cities closed their schools once again,"" the researchers wrote. 
Researchers noted caveats including that there could be errors in the historical record and the difficulties in interpreting data from 90 years ago. 
Navarro, one of the study authors, told PolitiFact that the study shows that communities must be very careful about removing social distancing restrictions too soon. Social distancing flattens the curve, but it doesn’t end the epidemic. It ends when a community  reaches hard immunity through vaccine or antibody reaction from infection.
A separate paper published in 2007 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences examined 17 U.S. cities during the flu pandemic. It found that cities in which interventions were implemented early had peak death rates about 50% lower than those that did not. It concluded that social distancing and other measures ""can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures.""
What this means for easing social distancing now
It’s tricky to compare lifting restrictions ""too early"" with ""holding them for longer,"" said Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiologist and one of the co-authors of the National Academy of Sciences paper. In either case, there will be some amount of resurgence once social distancing is let up.
A recent paper he co-authored in Science suggested that a single period of distancing could not permanently solve the problem; prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022.
""So overall, the problem is that it's not short vs. long, but single vs. repeated (or some other strategy such as a vaccine),"" he told PolitiFact.
On April 15, President Donald Trump said he thinks some states can open up before May 1. Many scientists have warned that ending the interventions prematurely will lead to more deaths.
Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, told the Associated Press on April 14 that the U.S. doesn’t yet have the contact tracing and testing needed to reopen the economy. He said Trump’s goal was a ""bit overly optimistic"" for parts of the country. 
""I’ll guarantee you, once you start pulling back there will be infections. It’s how you deal with the infections that’s going count,"" Fauci told the AP.
Our ruling
Whitmer said, ""During the flu pandemic of 1918, some cities lifted social distancing measures too fast, too soon, and created a second wave of pandemic.""
Typically, when social distancing ends, there is a second wave. The goal is to make the second wave as small as possible. Whitmer pointed to research from the University of Michigan in 2007 that found after social distancing rules ended in many cities, cases and deaths surged.

Dan Patrick","For now, Texas among states with lowest coronavirus death rate




If Your Time is short




Patrick's statement confuses the calculation for the coronavirus death rate, which is based on the number of fatalities and the number of confirmed cases.
Using the correct calculation and data from the day of his remarks, Patrick is right that Texas is among the states with the lowest death rate for the coronavirus — but the difference is slight. At the time, 29 states had a death rate of less than 2%.
Texas is also among the states that has administered the fewest number of tests for the virus, and experts cautioned that the actual death rate for the virus cannot be calculated until more people have been tested.




See the sources for this fact-check




During a March coronavirus briefing, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the state has one of the lowest coronavirus death rates in the country — a trend he said he hopes will continue through April.
""If you look at the death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country,"" he said. ""But we need to continue that for the rest of April. And even be better at that.""
The first issue here is that Patrick is conflating two calculations in his statement: the death rate for the coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas.
The death rate of a particular illness or disease is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the number of confirmed cases of the illness. A geography’s total population isn’t a factor.
It is possible to look at the number of coronavirus deaths per capita, but it says less about the danger posed by the virus than the death rate. To give Patrick a fair shake, we’ll take a look at both of these figures and how Texas compares to other states. Patrick did not return a request for comment seeking clarification on his statement.
""The death rate is generally a function of the number of people infected,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an email. ""We are often unsure of this because this depends on sampling, and the tests deployed.""
For this reason, we’ll also look at the number of tests administered by each state. As more tests are administered and more cases are identified, the death rate for the virus will change.
Given that the number of cases and fatalities is constantly changing, this fact-check will use data from March 31 — the day Patrick made his statement.
Along these lines, it is important to remember that the death rate at this point in time is just a snapshot.
""Case fatality rates are not constant. They can change considerably during an epidemic if, for example, it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought,"" according to a statement from the World Health Organization to PolitiFact at the end of March.
The WHO also noted that the rate may vary across different geographies due to ""demographic factors, for example differences in the age structure of the population.""
End of March numbers
At the time of Patrick’s remarks, there were 3,266 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Texas and 41 related deaths reported by state health authorities. This puts the approximate death rate for the virus at 1.26%, meaning 1.26% of people who tested positive for the virus died.
Looking at all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, Texas is among the areas with the lowest coronavirus death rate. Eleven states had a lower death rate when Patrick made his statement, including several with just one death: Wisconsin (1.18%), Missouri (1.06%), Tennessee (1.03%), South Dakota (0.93%), New Hampshire, (0.82%), West Virginia (0.62%), Utah (0.56%), North Carolina (0.53%), Hawaii (0.47%) and Wyoming, which had reported zero coronavirus deaths on the last day of March.

""It appears that Texas is among the states with low coronavirus deaths, but that is still true of large portions of the U.S. at this point,"" said Dr. Dhitinut Ratnapradipa, an environmental health professor at Sam Houston State University.
At the time of Patrick’s claim, 29 states had a death rate of less than 2%.
The state with the highest death rate on March 31 was Louisiana, with about 5,237 confirmed coronavirus cases and 239 deaths, a rate of 4.56%.
Patrick’s statement also referenced deaths ""per capita of 29 million people"" in Texas.
Texas is among the states with the fewest deaths per capita, based on March 31 coronavirus data and 2018 1-year population estimates from the Census Bureau’s American Communities Survey.
When Patrick spoke, there had been fewer than one coronavirus death for every 100,000 people in Texas. The state with the most deaths per capita at the time was New York, with about eight deaths per 100,000 people.
But Texas is also among the states that have administered the fewest number of coronavirus tests per capita.
At the time of Patrick’s statement, Texas had administered 42,992 coronavirus tests — about 150 per 100,000 people. New York had administered about 1,050 tests per 100,000 people, or 205,186 tests in total.
""The number of confirmed cases is directly related to testing,"" Ratnapradipa said in an email. ""There is likely widespread community infection of people with no or mild symptoms who are not being tested. This means that we cannot accurately calculate a COVID-19 fatality rate.""
Cohen said it is important to remember that the current pandemic is ""dynamic and growing, worldwide"" and that declaring any kind of victory over the virus ""is probably a bad idea at this point in time for most places on the planet.""
Since Patrick made this claim, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the state has almost doubled, the state confirmed more than 1,000 additional cases and administered more than 10,000 additional tests.
Our ruling
Patrick said looking at the coronavirus ""death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country.""
Patrick’s statement equates the death rate for coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas, two different calculations.
It is true that, at the time of Patrick’s statement, Texas was among the states with the lowest coronavirus death rate (and those with lowest number of deaths per capita) — but not by much. There were 29 states with a death rate of less than 2%.
Experts cautioned that the actual coronavirus death rate cannot be accurately calculated until more people have been tested — and Texas is among the states with the lowest number of tests administered per capita.
Patrick’s comparison is accurate based on the information available at the time of his statement, but his claim needs clarification and is missing important context about testing.

Lou Dobbs","Lou Dobbs says United States ‘screening fewer people’ for coronavirus than other countries




If Your Time is short





The CDC has stopped publicly reporting the number of tests it’s administered.


So far, the United States has lagged behind other nations in terms of coronavirus testing. It has recently taken steps to ramp up its testing capabilities. 


Until recently, the U.S. had insisted that only the CDC’s test could be used — despite flaws in some early kits — and that only certain patients could get tested.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and his allies, challenged the president’s top health official recently on the administration’s handling of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak.
Dobbs criticized Health and Human Secretary Alex Azar over a lack of transparency in the agency’s handling of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 91,000 people globally across 73 countries and led to more than nine American deaths. 
""There’s a better ratio of testing for the coronavirus in other countries than we maintain here,"" Dobbs said during the March 2 interview on his TV show. ""We’re actually screening fewer people because we don’t have appropriate testing.""
Azar countered that the Trump administration has taken recent steps to roll back regulations and increase the availability of diagnostic test kits to ""hundreds and thousands and millions.""

The United States is set to significantly expand its testing capabilities in the coming days and weeks, but Dobbs is correct that the country has lagged behind other nations so far.
""It is true that diagnostic capacity in the U.S. has been lower than in some other countries, but that is changing,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
The trouble with testing numbers
It’s hard to pinpoint how many people have been tested for the coronavirus, both in the U.S. and around the world. The World Health Organization doesn’t track the number of tests administered in each country, and the numbers that are available are constantly updating.
In a statement to PolitiFact, a Fox News spokesperson representing Dobbs cited data from the WorldOMeter, a real-time tool that ""shows estimated current numbers based on statistics and projections from the most reputable official organizations,"" according to its website.
Using estimates derived from official government sources, the WorldOMeter says at least eight countries — South Korea, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Vietnam and Turkey — have given more tests relative to the size of their populations than the United States. 
That lines up with experts’ analyses and with what multiple news outlets have reported.  
Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said South Korea ""has screened at least thousands, and Guangdong, China, has screened at least hundreds of thousands,"" citing a WHO report on the outbreak in China, where the virus was first detected.
South Korea ramped up testing by building drive-thru screening clinics for speedy assessments, according to local reports. Other countries, like Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Italy have also conducted thousands of diagnostic tests.
""We have done nothing like what other countries have done,"" Lipsitch said, noting that the U.S. had, until recently, limited not only the number of labs that were allowed to conduct tests on suspected cases, but also the number of patients that were eligible to be screened.
It’s difficult to say just how far behind the U.S. has fallen, due to the murkiness around the number of administered tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped releasing a public count of tests on March 2.
The administration’s public statements haven’t cleared it up. On Feb. 29, the CDC reported testing 472 Americans. A day later, Azar told ABC News the U.S. had tested over 3,600 people. And a spokesperson for HHS, Azar’s agency, told us on March 3 that the CDC had tested samples from more than 1,200 patients.

""I don't know how to track U.S. tests any more,"" Lipsitch said.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar speaks at the White House about the coronavirus on Feb. 28, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Vucci)
The CDC stopped posting testing data as more state and local public-health labs have been brought into the fold, said Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official, said during a March 3 briefing.
""With more and more testing done at states, these numbers would not be representative of the testing being done nationally,"" she said.
An HHS spokesperson told us that the department doesn’t know how many additional tests have been administered by those state and local labs, adding that those labs can now test up to 15,000 people and are expected to be able to test as many as 75,000 people by March 6.
The U.S. test count should rise into the millions as IDT, a commercial manufacturer, and other commercial and academic labs begin producing their own tests soon, according to HHS.
Why the United States lagged behind
The government’s initial testing effort was hindered by flaws with the CDC’s early test kits and restrictions that had limited which labs could run the tests and which patients could be tested.
When the first U.S. coronavirus was detected, the country brushed aside the WHO test used by other nations and leaned on the CDC to develop and mass produce a more complicated test capable of detecting other viruses in addition to the coronavirus, according to reports.
The test kits went out in early February. But some state labs that received them reported that flaws in the tests were triggering inconclusive results. Those states had to ship samples out to the CDC’s offices in Atlanta for results until the CDC fixed the problem weeks later.
Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has given labs and hospitals across the country the go-ahead to administer their own tests before the FDA finishes reviewing them, so long as those tests are proven to work. That should lead to more testing, experts said.
The CDC also modified its screening criteria to expand testing for some people with severe respiratory symptoms who did not travel to China or come into known contact with a coronavirus patient. Previously, travel to China or exposure to the virus were preconditions for screening.
Adequate testing is essential to getting an accurate count of U.S. cases, experts said.
Testing is also key for treating patients and identifying people who might be infected but don’t show symptoms, said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.
""The latest data suggests the incubation period for COVID-19 can be as long as a couple of weeks,"" Watanabe said. 
Despite the recent acceleration, Lipsitch said U.S. testing is happening ""very slowly and at a level that is still paltry"" compared with some other countries.
Our ruling
Dobbs said that the United States is ""actually screening fewer people (for the coronavirus than other countries) because we don’t have appropriate testing.""
Experts told us that to date, the United States has lagged behind other countries, though numbers are imprecise. An error with the CDC’s early test kits contributed to the United States’ relatively low screening numbers. The administration has taken steps to make testing more widely available.

Joe Biden","Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim that Trump delayed $8 billion in coronavirus funding for tribes




If Your Time is short





The $2.2 trillion CARES Act included $8 billion for tribal governments. The law said funds had to be disbursed within 30 days.


More than a month after the CARES Act, the Trump administration said it would begin giving tribes part of the funds.


A judge presiding over a lawsuit on the delay said the administration should have made more progress, but did not find that the delay was egregious. 





See the sources for this fact-check





Native American tribes have been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, and Joe Biden claims that President Donald Trump has not done enough to help.
""Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans,"" Biden told The Arizona Republic May 21. ""He took more than a month to allocate Congress’ emergency funding to tribes — and only did so after tribes sued. He has failed to provide tribes with adequate protective personal equipment and medical supplies. It’s unacceptable.""
Indian treaty rights recognized and established rights, benefits, and conditions for tribes who agreed to cede millions of acres of land to the United States and to accept the United States’ protection. Under a ""trust responsibility"" legal principle, the United States federal government is obligated to ensure the survival and welfare of Indian tribes.
Is Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, right that it took more than a month for tribes to get funding allocated by Congress, and that it happened only after suing the Trump administration? The chronology lines up, but omits important context.
The Treasury Department has argued that payments were delayed because it is required to consult with tribes and the Interior Department regarding how much money to allocate to tribes. That consultation process started before the lawsuit over the delay in payments. A separate lawsuit filed by tribes to prevent corporations in Alaska from receiving aid has also affected the process.
CARES Act allocated $8 billion for tribal governments
Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and Trump signed it into law March 27. The $2.2 trillion measure included a $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund for states, local governments, and tribal governments.
The law set aside $8 billion for tribal governments. The law said the Treasury secretary had to make the payments within 30 days; so by April 26, all entities were supposed to have received funds. It wasn’t until May 5 that the Treasury Department said it would begin making funds available to tribal governments. So that part of Biden’s claim adds up.
Lawsuits over corporations’ eligibility, payment delays
By May 5, the Trump administration was facing several lawsuits by multiple tribes: for delay of payment. The lawsuits also challenged the administration for intending to direct some of the funds to the Alaska Native Corporations, which are regional and village corporations recognized under Alaska law and created by Congress as part of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.
In the lawsuit to stop the corporations from getting a share of the $8 billion, tribes argued that corporations do not meet the statutory definition of ""tribal government,"" or ""Indian tribe"" and therefore did not qualify for the relief. A federal district judge on April 27 issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the Treasury from giving money to the corporations. Pending a final determination, the judge did not direct the Treasury secretary to immediately disburse the entire $8 billion to the tribes.
In its May 5 announcement, the Trump administration said it would begin paying tribes 60% of the $8 billion, or $4.8 billion, based on population data. The remaining 40% would be paid at ""a later date"" based on employment data and tribe expenses related to COVID-19. Amounts calculated for corporations would be held back ""until pending litigation relating to their eligibility is resolved.""

The Navajo Nation, which joined tribes in the lawsuit, on May 5 said the judge’s April 27 ruling ""led to the (Treasury) Department’s announcement to begin distributing funds to federally-recognized tribes.""
In a separate lawsuit over the delay in the disbursement of funds, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that providing funds to tribal governments required a more involved and difficult process than the one for states and local governments.
While the CARES Act imposed a 30-day deadline for funds disbursement, it also called for a consultation process among tribes and the Treasury and Interior departments. According to the Trump administration, Treasury staff spent about 2,200 hours on efforts to get tribes the appropriated money.
The same federal district judge from the corporations case said that those hours of labor ""arguably should have produced better results,"" but a court intervention was not warranted.
""‘Egregious’ delay is the governing standard, and the Secretary is not there quite yet, even in the midst of a public health crisis,"" U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote in a May 11 opinion.
Mehta did not find that the Treasury secretary was ""lagging unreasonably"" behind in delivering the funds. ""The Secretary has not been ‘twiddling his thumbs’,"" he said, citing language from a precedent.
Mehta said he would not give the Treasury department a deadline for disbursing the rest of the funds, but if it took the department double the amount of time Congress directed for the disbursement, ""then the question of egregiousness becomes a closer one than it is today.""
Our ruling
Biden said Trump ""took more than a month to allocate Congress’ emergency funding to tribes — and only did so after tribes sued.""
It did take more than a month for tribes to begin receiving funds appropriated by Congress, and they began to flow after lawsuits were filed against the Trump administration. But a consultation process for disbursing the funds began before the administration was sued.

Tony Evers","Wisconsin is trending poorly on COVID-19 cases, but Evers’ stat isn’t quite right




If Your Time is short





Evers’ specific claim doesn’t clarify that he’s talking about recent stats, but it was made in the context of a discussion of recent trends.


Over the entirety of the pandemic, Wisconsin is 30th in COVID-19 cases per capita.


But Evers’ general point was that Wisconsin is in worse shape than it was, and that’s accurate. 


In the week leading up to this statement, Wisconsin had the fifth-highest rate of new cases per capita in the country.





See the sources for this fact-check




In a Sept. 15, 2020, daily briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Tony Evers made his case that Wisconsin needs to take the coronavirus more seriously.
""We need to take every precaution, perhaps more than ever to keep our families, neighbors and communities safe,"" Evers said. ""On Sunday, we had another record-setting day for the number of positive cases.""
That’s correct — the 1,582 tally on Sept. 13 was the highest yet.
Then the governor addressed where Wisconsin stood relative to other states.
""According to a nationwide analysis, Wisconsin is one of the nine states with the highest rate of infection per capita,"" Evers said. ""We cannot continue on this path. At one point, Wisconsin was in a pretty good place, but that is no longer the case.""
Is Wisconsin really among the nine worst states in the nation?
Evers is right about trending in the wrong direction, but his description of the stat isn’t quite right.
Let’s take a closer look.
Wisconsin cases have spiked
Asked for evidence of the nine-worst-states claim, Evers’ staff pointed to a New York Times breakdown of cases by state.
The analysis, updated daily, shows Wisconsin as of Sept. 15 had the fifth-highest number of new cases per capita over the last seven days — 147 per 100,000 residents. Only North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri and Oklahoma were worse in that span.

The Times used that data to identify Wisconsin as one of nine states ""where new cases are higher and staying high.""
Indeed, since the start of September, the number of new cases and the percentage of positive tests in Wisconsin have both marched steadily upwards, regularly hitting highs not seen before  during the pandemic.
But that’s not exactly how Evers described the situation. He said Wisconsin was among those with the ""highest rate of infection per capita,"" with no mention that he was only referring to the preceding week.
And in the longer view, Wisconsin stacks up differently.
The Times data showed Wisconsin is 30th in cases per capita overall. That’s in line with similar data maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others. 
In other words, Wisconsin was in much better shape relative to other states earlier in the pandemic, but not anymore — which was Evers’ underlying point.
Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Evers, said his statement should be understood as referring to only recent cases by implication, since it was during a discussion of recent trends.
Our ruling
In a media briefing on COVID-19, Evers said, ""Wisconsin is one of the nine states with the highest rate of infection per capita.""
Evers was discussing how the Wisconsin situation used to be better than most states, but now it’s among the worst. That general point is correct, but his reference isn’t quite right.
Wisconsin is among the states with the highest rates of new cases, a crucial descriptor that Evers left out of his stat. Without that, Evers’ statement could refer to total cases in Wisconsin, where the state ranks 30th.

Facebook posts","Study now says Wis. coronavirus cases will peak April 26. But that’s not the date that went viral.




If Your Time is short





The first iteration of a study estimating coronavirus peak dates for each state pegged Wisconsin at May 22, last in the nation by two weeks.


But updates to the model used in the study changed the dates for almost all states, affecting Wisconsin the most.


The organization now predicts an April 26 peak in Wisconsin.


That’s about middle-of-the-pack among the 50 states, but still 11 days after the projected peak for the nation as a whole.





See the sources for this fact-check




Specifics have been hard to come by in this pandemic.
We don’t know how many people are infected, how fast the coronavirus is spreading or how long we may need to quarantine.
So the first study to project a date when each state’s cases would peak drew a lot of interest -- especially since Wisconsin jumped off the virtual page.
The study, released March 26, 2020, said cases wouldn’t peak in Wisconsin until May 22, 2020 — a month later than most states, and nearly two weeks later than any other state in the nation.
The date went viral. News outlets across the state picked it up, and one writeup of the story from Madison365.com received nearly 40,000 comments, reactions and shares on Facebook in a day.
And then the study changed.
An updated analysis posted four days after the original study moved Wisconsin’s projected peak by almost a month to April 26, 2020.
So what’s up with the shift? Which date is right?
This post, when the study offered a May peak, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Here’s what we found.
The original study
The analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — an independent research center based at the University of Washington — developed a model projecting coronavirus growth across the United States for the next four months.
It projects deaths as well as a variety of measures of hospital utilization — beds used, intensive care unit days and ventilators days used. That estimate was based on COVID-19 deaths so far, data on hospital capacity and use and more detailed coronavirus hospitalization data available in some localities.
The institute estimates the pandemic would peak nationally around mid-April and result in more than 80,000 deaths, a summary of the study said.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







The state-by-state projections were based on a statistical model — essentially a detailed formula that projects the future virus spread based on death rates and other data available to this point.
And those projections moved a lot after the initial release.
The update
Four days after the original publication, on March 30, 2020, researchers added 1,730 nationwide deaths to the model and tweaked the methodology. They said the updates created more precise estimates
The updated projections changed the estimated peak for all but four states. Wisconsin moved the most, to 26 days earlier, but several others saw dramatic shifts as well. Maryland’s estimated peak moved to 25 days later, Missouri to 21 days later and Idaho to 13 days sooner.
Ali Mokdad, a senior faculty member at the institute, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the original model – started around the beginning of March – assumed Wisconsin would have a Safer at Home-style order in place about two weeks sooner than it did. Gov. Tony Evers issued the order banning all but essential services and travel on March 24, 2020.
The update factors in that actual date along with additional death data, which dramatically changed the model’s analysis of the state.
The new projected peak for Wisconsin, April 26, 2020, is still later than what state health officials are saying. Wisconsin Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm said March 30, 2020, the state expected the curve to begin flattening (i.e. peaking) in about 10 days.
""It’ll be a couple of weeks before we start to really understand how well we are doing, social distancing, safer at home, to really judge ourselves against the worst case models,"" Palm said in a media briefing with Evers and other officials. ""We really do believe it’s another 10-plus days before we are going to be able to see evidence of a flattening off of the new daily cases.""
The viral story from Madison365.com quickly updated to reflect the new numbers, so Facebook posts of that story shared before or after that update now show a headline that accurately references the new April 26 peak.
Instead of being the latest peak in the country, Wisconsin is now right in the middle of the pack – tied for 20th-latest with three other states. The peak is two weeks after the projected national peak of April 15, 2020.
Our ruling
Facebook posts now circulating say Wisconsin will hit the peak for coronavirus cases on April 26.
That gives us an unusual fact check, since at the time most of those stories were shared, the post referenced a May 22 date that is no longer the best estimate from this study. But Facebook’s design updates a linked story when the story is updated.
We aren’t getting into whether this is an accurate model, since it’s a prediction of the future and there’s no way to say for sure. But we can examine the accuracy of the Facebook post itself.
What is currently online in this viral post is an accurate reflection of the study, albeit one that requires a bit of extra context to understand the genesis of the current figures.

Facebook posts","Yes, Biden has said 150 million Americans died from guns and another 120 million from COVID-19




If Your Time is short





A Facebook post said presidential candidate Joe Biden said 150 million people died from gun violence and 120 million people died from COVID-19


In February, Biden incorrectly said in the final Democratic primary debate that 150 million Americans have been killed with guns. Biden’s campaign admitted this was a mistake after the debate and the number was supposed to be 150,000 people.


Presidential candidate Joe Biden incorrectly said on June 25 at a campaign event that 120 million people died from COVID-19. As of June 25, more than 119,000 died according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center’s U.S. map.


After making the ‘120 million’ claim, Biden immediately corrected himself.


The Facebook ad was correct in that Biden made these claims. The numbers in these claims are incorrect.





See the sources for this fact-check




Former Vice President Joe Biden has drawn mockery and criticism — primarily from conservatives — for verbal missteps throughout his presidential campaign.
One recent Facebook post pulled out two statistical claims in particular, connected to gun violence and COVID-19.
The July 13, 2020, post said with a laughing emoji: ""America has around 300 million people. Joe Biden said 150 MILLION were lost to gun violence AND we just lost ANOTHER 120 million to covid-19. So I’m reaching out to my friends to see if ANY of you are still alive""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).
This is obviously a joke, but it raises a question about Biden’s comments. Did he really claim both of those statistics at some point?  
The botched stats
Yes, Biden made these claims on two separate occasions, though for one he corrected himself immediately.
Biden made the claim regarding the U.S. COVID-19 death toll on June 25, 2020, at a campaign event in Pennsylvania. He was talking about health care coverage with families.
An ABC News Facebook Live video shows an attendee at the event mentioned the stress she felt over finances in addition to stress from hospital treatments, and how it all lowered her already low mental health at that time. Biden answered he intended to invest in mental health.
""That’s why we have a major multibillion dollar investment in mental health,"" Biden said. ""What people drastically underestimate is the impact on the mental health of people who now, everything is complicated. People don’t have a job. People don’t have anywhere to go. They don’t know what they’re going to do.""
He went on to say ""Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID, I mean, 120,000 dead from COVID,"" according to audio obtained by Snopes.com.

Biden made the gun violence claim in the final Democratic primary debate on Feb. 25, 2020, in South Carolina, where he said that 150 million Americans died since 2007 due to gun violence.
""In addition to that, I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend on my right,"" Biden said, gesturing to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, ""and others have in fact also gave in to the gun manufacturers absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we give immunity to drug companies. We give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets; 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.""
So, the Facebook post is correct in that he made these claims, though it omits the date range Biden used and doesn’t give Biden credit for immediately correcting the COVID data error.
The real numbers
In both cases, Biden or his staff acknowledged he intended to say thousands, not millions. 
As Biden noted a moment after referencing millions of COVID deaths the current death toll remains in the thousands. As of June 25, 2020 when he made this statement, the death toll was more than 119,000, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center dashboard.
On the gun violence claim, a member of Biden’s campaign said Biden meant to say 150,000 people. Biden has previously referenced that stat correctly.
Data from the CDC shows from 2007 to 2018 there were 148,182 firearm homicides.
Our ruling
A Facebook post said Biden said 120 million Americans died from COVID-19 and that 150 million Americans died from gun violence since 2007. 
Both of those numbers are drastically wrong. Biden meant to say ""thousands"" in both cases, not ""millions.""
The post is correct that Biden did make these claims, but after misstating the COVID stat he immediately corrected himself, a detail the post omits.

Viral image","Reviewing CDC's suggestions for how protect students and educators from the coronavirus




If Your Time is short




This image is not from the CDC website, but it roughly summarizes suggestions the agency has for reopening schools as safely as possible.




See the sources for this fact-check




As school districts grapple with how to educate students in the next academic year amid the coronavirus, a list summarizing some of the federal government’s suggestions for how to safely return to the classroom is being shared on social media — but it’s missing some context.
Some people reading the list on social media are misinterpreting these suggestions as mandates. But the language throughout the CDC’s actual advice comes with numerous caveats such as ""when possible,"" ""schools may consider,""and ""as feasible."" 
""Here we go,"" begins the text of the image being shared widely on Facebook. ""New CDC guidelines for reopening schools."" They’re written as follows: 

Wear masks over the age of 2
No sharing of any items or supplies, all belongings in individual cubbies or labeled containers; no sharing electronic devices, toys, games, learning aids
Desks 6 feet apart, all facing the same way
Distance on school buses- one child per seat, skip rows
Install sneeze guards and partitions wherever you cannot space 6ft apart
One way routes in hallways; tape on sidewalks and walls to assure kids stay 6ft apart
No communal shared spaces - cafeterias, playgrounds
Physical barriers or screens between sinks in bathrooms
Only pre-packaged boxes or bags of food instead of cafeteria food; kids eat in classrooms
No field trips, assemblies, or external organizations in schools. Limit volunteers and visitors. 
Same children stay with same staff all day, no switching groups or teachers. 
Stagger arrival and departure times for students to limit exposure to crowds of kids. 
If possible, daily health and temperature checks. 
And several rules about cleaning and disinfecting throughout the day and hand washing frequently.

""This is off CDC website about school starting back in the fall,"" one account wrote about the image, linking to a web page about ""considerations for schools"" on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The inconsistent punctuation and casual language — ""here we go"" — were the first clues: this image of ""guidelines"" isn’t directly from the CDC website. But the CDC did update its ""considerations for schools"" on May 19, describing ""ways in which schools can help protect students, teachers, administrators, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19."" 
These are not mandates. Rather, the CDC says, schools can work with state and local health officials to decide ""whether and how to implement these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community."" Implementation ""should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community."" 
The agency notes that online classes and activities are the least risky way to educate kids. Small, in-person classes with students social distancing are riskier, while full-sized, in-person classes where students aren’t spaced apart and share supplies pose the highest risk.
The CDC also released on May 19 what the Washington Post described as a ""low-key guide to reopening,"" including ""a raft of social distancing policies"" schools. Let’s look at what the agency says compared to the list circulating on Facebook.
We’ll break it down and show you what the CDC actually said: 
""Wear masks over the age of 2""
Yes, the CDC says children younger than 2 should not wear masks. As for kids over the age of 2, though, it suggests schools ""teach and reinforce use of cloth face coverings"" and notes that masks are most essential when physical distancing is difficult.
""No sharing of any items or supplies, all belongings in individual cubbies or labeled containers; no sharing electronic devices, toys, games, learning aids""
The CDC says ""schools may consider"" implementing strategies that include avoiding sharing electronic devices, toys, books and other games or learning aids, and limiting the use of shared gym or PE equipment, art supplies, toys and games. ""Discourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect,"" it says. ""Keep each child’s belongings separated from others’ and in individually labeled containers, cubbies or areas."" 
""Desks 6 feet apart, all facing the same way""
This is mostly right. The CDC does recommend desks and student seats be at least 6 feet apart ""when feasible."" And, it says, ""turn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have students sit on only one side of tables, space apart.""
""Distance on school buses- one child per seat, skip rows""
Yes, ""when possible"" the CDC suggests creating distance between children on buses. It gives as an example the idea of seating only one child per row and skipping rows.
""Install sneeze guards and partitions wherever you cannot space 6ft apart""

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







It says to ""install physical barriers"" in areas where it is hard for people to keep at least 6 feet apart. Sneeze guards and partitions are examples of such barriers.
""One way routes in hallways; tape on sidewalks and walls to assure kids stay 6ft apart""
In areas where it’s hard for people to keep 6-feet apart, ""physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls,"" can be used to help make one-way hallway routes. 
""No communal shared spaces - cafeterias, playgrounds""
Yes, the CDC suggests closing communal spaces like dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground equipment ""if possible."" ""Otherwise,"" it says, ""stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.""
""Physical barriers or screens between sinks in bathrooms""
Yes, the CDC suggests adding ""physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart.""
""Only pre-packaged boxes or bags of food instead of cafeteria food; kids eat in classrooms""
""As feasible,"" kids should bring their own meals or else schools should ""serve individually plated meals in classrooms instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria."" At events, the CDC recommends food come in pre-packaged, single-serve boxes or bags instead of a buffet or family-style meal.
""No field trips, assemblies, or external organizations in schools. Limit volunteers and visitors."" 
It does recommend that schools opt for ""virtual activities"" instead of field trips, student assemblies, special performances, school-wide parent meetings, and spirit nights."" Nonessential visitors and volunteers should also be limited ""as possible.""
""Same children stay with same staff all day, no switching groups or teachers."" 
Essentially, yes, but without the hard line: ""Ensure that student and staff groupings are as static as possible by having the same group of children stay with the same staff (all day for young children, and as much as possible for older children). Limit mixing between groups, if possible.""
""Stagger arrival and departure times for students to limit exposure to crowds of kids."" 
The CDC suggests staggering arrival and drop-off times or locations in groups of students, or putting protocols in place to limit contact between each group.
""If possible, daily health and temperature checks."" 
""If feasible, conduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking) of staff and students.""
""And several rules about cleaning and disinfecting throughout the day and hand washing frequently.""
The CDC says to ""teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds"" and advises schools to provide hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t readily available. It also suggests cleaning and disinfecting touched surfaces like playground equipment, door handles, sink handles and water fountains at least daily or between use as much as possible. 
Our ruling
The image being shared on Facebook roughly summarizes some of the CDC’s suggestions for reopening schools amid the new coronavirus. But the guidelines listed are not mandated by the CDC, and they’re not comprehensive — the agency has other suggestions not mentioned in the image, such as offering options to protect staff and students who have a higher risk of severe illness.

Jill Underly","Wisconsin schools leader on the mark with claim that masks are factor in mitigating COVID spread




If Your Time is short



 


We could not locate a study that ranked the various methods for mitigating spread of the coronavirus. 


But experts agree that mask wearing is a primary way to do so, albeit in conjunction with other steps, such as hand-washing, social-distancing and -- now that vaccines are available -- getting a shot





See the sources for this fact-check




More than a year into the coronavirus pandemic, debate remains around a central means of combating the spread of COVID-19: To wear or not to wear a mask.
At least the debate still exists among the general public and some politicians. Science and public health experts have pretty much all come down on one side: Mask up.
That’s where newly-elected Superintendent of Public Instruction Jill Underly fell when asked for her opinion on school mask requirements during an interview April 11, 2021 on WISN’s ""UpFront."" 
""As far as mitigating spread, they say that masks is the number one way to do so,"" Underly said. ""And I feel that is, that's what we need to do to keep our buildings open. I think we should be wearing masks. But again, that's my recommendation, I believe in the science. But I do feel that each school district is going to have to make that decision for themselves."" 
Underly made the comment at a point when thousands of students in Milwaukee Public Schools and the Madison Metropolitan School District were returning to the classroom, at least on a hybrid basis, for the first time since the pandemic began. Most other other districts in the state had been operating in person for months, some from the start of the school year last fall.
Still, there has been pushback against the decisions, including by the Milwaukee Teachers’ Education Association, the teacher’s union, which has questioned the safety of returning to in-person learning.
Let’s focus on Underly’s claim about mask’s being the best way to mitigate COVID-19 spread.
How does wearing masks rate?
In February, we rated True a claim by Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, that ""we know mask mandates work. There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t.""
Nothing has changed since then in terms of the science behind the effectiveness of masks.
But what about Underly’s claim that masks rank at the top of the mitigation list?
When asked for backup for the claim, Erin Forrest of Underly’s transition team emailed a list of articles and studies related to the science behind masks, including a University of California San Francisco June 26, 2020 paper ""Still Confused About Masks? Here’s the Science Behind How Face Masks Prevent Coronavirus"" and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""Face Masks, Including Surgical Masks, and Respirators for COVID-19.""
""It’s also important to note that right now there is no vaccine approved for people under 16 years of age,"" Forrest said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.   
But she did not cite any study that ranked the various methods for mitigating spread of the coronavirus. We could not find any either in our search. 
That said, experts agree that mask wearing is a primary way to do so, albeit in conjunction with other steps, such as hand-washing, social-distancing and -- now that vaccines are available -- getting a shot.
Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us wearing a properly fitted mask is ""imperative."" 
""Both masks and physical distancing are needed to interrupt transmission of the coronavirus in indoor environments,"" Sethi said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""When food or drink is being served for consumption, then maintaining proper physical distance is imperative. When maintaining physical distance is challenging, then wearing a high quality, properly fit mask is imperative. Ideally, both wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing are being done together.""

City of Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson told us: ""Masking is at the top of the list for the Milwaukee Health Department. Combined with vaccination, that is the best way to stop COVID."" 
That point is echoed in numerous other places.
Harvard Medical School puts mask wearing at the top of its list of steps individuals can take. Yale Medicine includes it on its list, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance April 6, 2021on improving the fit and filtration of masks that included this note: ""Correct and consistent mask use is a critical step everyone can take to reduce their risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.""
Finally, the World Health Organization, in a Q&A posted on its website, notes that ""masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives.""
The website goes on to say:
""Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more.""
Our ruling
Underly said for mitigating COVID-19 spread, ""masks (are) the number one way to do so."" 
Experts at the local, national (CDC) and international (WHO) level, all say that masks are vital to lowering the risk of spreading COVID-19. That said, they also note simply wearing a mask is not enough and that other mitigation strategies, such as vaccination, social distancing and hand washing are also important. 
And, for the most part, students cannot be vaccinated. The vaccines are only available to those 16 and older.
We rate Underly’s claim Mostly True.

Experts say it’s too early to say for sure, but it’s  eradicating COVID-19 will be a difficult undertaking — even after a vaccine


Many expect it to remain in the environment and ebb and flow like the seasonal flu





See the sources for this fact-check




The debate over when to re-open Wisconsin has escalated quickly.
Frustration with the extended quarantine is mounting on social media, and residents around the state have defied social distancing orders to attend rallies demanding Gov. Tony Evers ease restrictions.
Protesters say the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed enough to justify reopening, given the mounting economic and health impacts.
One viral Facebook post — making the case to move toward re-opening the state — says we need to get used to living in a world with COVID-19.
It was posted April 26, 2020, by Dr. David Murdock, a research cardiologist with the Aspirus health system in Wausau who was placed on leave after attending an April 19, 2020, re-open rally in Mosinee.
""The consensus medical view is that this virus is here to stay. In other words, this virus cannot be defeated simply by staying inside for a couple of months,"" wrote Murdock, who said he was observing from the rear of the rally at a safe distance to gather material for a memoir. ""The world will likely see periodic outbreaks, and we need to accept that and be prepared to deal with COVID long term.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Murdock makes an array of points in the wide-ranging post, which has been shared more than 2,000 times. But we’re especially interested in the claim about the longevity of COVID-19.
Of course, the ""Safer at Home"" order from Evers —  and similar efforts across the country, including guidance from President Donald Trump —  is not designed to eradicate the disease. It was implemented to slow the spread so hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. 
Understanding that, we still wanted to examine the underlying claim.
COVID-19 has sickened 3 million and killed more than 200,000 globally. Is it really here to stay?
We asked the experts.
Vaccine no guarantee to end COVID-19
Many experts have said a true return to normalcy likely isn’t possible until a vaccine is widely available, which could be a year or more.
""We're going to probably all need to be used to social distancing for the next 12 to 18 months,"" John Raymond, CEO of the Medical College of Wisconsin, said during an April 27, 2020, online briefing for the Greater Milwaukee Committee. ""Until hopefully we have an effective vaccine, it's likely we're going to be living with COVID-19.""
But a vaccine doesn’t necessarily mean the end of COVID-19.
Like much about this coronavirus, this isn’t something we can say for sure yet. But experts we talked to said complete eradication would be a major undertaking.
""Absent a vaccine, I think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with,"" said Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University’s School of Public Health. ""It is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory viraI infections.""

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The vaccine he references would be a theoretical one that is 100% effective and gives lifelong immunity. But vaccines are ""almost never perfect,"" notes Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard.
Bloom also expressed concern over the volume of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccinations on social media, which include a host of conspiracy theories about pushing people to vaccinate and concerns about how the vaccines may be dangerous. That could affect willingness to take a vaccine once it’s available.
""The vaccine is only a tool if it’s used,"" Bloom said.
What we don’t know
Hanage said an array of key unknowns will determine the long-term future of COVID-19. They include:


Whether people can get re-infected, and how severe those recurrences would be


How much immunity results from minor infections


How the summer warmup alters infectiousness (based on both people’s behavior and the reaction of the virus itself; generally coronaviruses don’t survive as long in warmer weather)


Even if the virus does stick around, though, it may not be the threat it is today.
""If that immunity is not very long-lasting — and we have good reason from other coronaviruses including the original SARS, that it won’t be — what type of infections will people have when their immunity starts to wane?"" Hanage said. ""The first thing to say is we don’t know, but I think it’s also plausible to suggest they might be milder.""
It’s worth noting that SARS — a disease caused by a coronavirus that killed 800 during a 2003 outbreak — has been eradicated. But there are key differences that make COVID-19 a more formidable foe.
In a March 5, 2020, article for The Lancet medical journal, Annelies Wilder-Smith noted COVID-19 can be passed on by those with minor symptoms or none at all (SARS patients generally weren’t contagious until they had severe symptoms). And COVID-19 is more easily transmitted and has had a more prevalent community spread.
""The virus remains, and we need to learn how to deal with it,"" Wilder-Smith, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Certainly lock-down is only a temporary solution whilst we gear up to provide the true solution. Yes, we need to prepare for this reality.""
Charles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told PolitiFact Wisconsin eradicating the virus like we did with smallpox ""will be challenging, to say the least."" Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said COVID-19 sticking around is ""likely, but not inevitable.""
Khan noted some countries already are attempting to eliminate the virus. China, New Zealand, Australia and Vietnam have all set a goal of not just containment, but elimination. The New York Times reported April 24, 2020 that the adjoining nations of Australia and New Zealand are seeing just a handful of new infections each day and closing in on their ""extraordinary goal.""
Our ruling
A widely shared Facebook post from a Wisconsin doctor said we need to face the reality that COVID-19 is ""here to stay"" and ""we need to accept that and be prepared to deal with COVID long term.""
He was making the point that staying indoors for another month or two with extended shelter-in-place orders won’t get rid of the virus. (Though, as noted, the shelter-in-place orders are not meant to fully eradicate the virus.)
Experts say it’s still too early to know this with complete certainty, since much remains unknown about the nature of immunity. And we have no clue how effective a future vaccine may be.
But a best guess at this point is that COVID-19 could indeed stick around long-term, waxing and waning similar to the seasonal flu. Experts say there’s also reason to believe that lingering version could be less severe, though, a nuance Murdock did not address.

Coalition for the Homeless","Fact-checking a claim about hotel rooms and the homeless in New York City




If Your Time is short



• The number of hotel rooms being used for housing homeless New Yorkers is well short of the tens of thousands of rooms needed to house all of New York City’s homeless population. 
• The main reason is the high cost, although the city has modestly increased the number of homeless individuals it has moved into hotels since the onset of the pandemic.



See the sources for this fact-check




New York City has been hit especially hard by coronavirus, and the city’s homeless population in particular has struggled to comply with social distancing practices that public health officials have urged to contain the pandemic.
In an urgent letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo on April 3, 2020, a group of service and advocacy groups pressed for action. 
The letter, spearheaded by the New York City-based Coalition for the Homeless, said that only 16.8% of New York City hotel rooms were occupied at the time, leaving more than 100,000 rooms empty. Yet at the same time, the groups said, more than 3,588 people were living on the streets and over 19,000 were living in shelters. 
Five days later, Giselle Routhier, the policy director for the Coalition for the Homeless, told the New York Daily News, ""We could open up tens of thousands of hotel rooms and offer every single person on the subway access to them. The mayor has absolutely to this point refused to do that.""
Is this accurate? Yes, though the assertion needs some additional context. (The mayor’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.)
Is it within de Blasio’s power to secure hotel rooms?
There is longstanding precedent for the city paying hotels to provide emergency housing for New York City residents. In 2018, for instance, the city spent $364 million on annual contracts for emergency housing in hotels for homeless New Yorkers. 
The challenge is the expense of paying for these hotel rooms.
""The city has routinely used hotels as ‘emergency’ housing, but the cost has been exorbitant, ranging from $170 to $250 per night for one dwelling unit,"" Roderick M. Hills Jr., a New York University law professor, told PolitiFact.
On April 23, Erin Drinkwater, the city’s deputy commissioner of the Department of Social Services, testified that prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the department paid $17 million per month to rent approximately 3,500 double-occupancy hotel rooms for homeless single adults.

Under proposed legislation requiring single-occupancy rooms, that cost would increase to $28 million per month, due to the cost of additional hotel rooms as well as security and operational needs, Drinkwater testified. 
In her testimony, Drinkwater said that in addition to the 3,500 individuals already living in hotels, the city planned to move another 2,500 individuals — including people over 70, those with underlying health conditions, and those staying in the 10 most densely populated city shelters — to hotels by the end of April. 
How many homeless New Yorkers would require hotels?
The Coalition for the Homeless told PolitiFact that Routhier’s reference to tens of thousands of hotel rooms was not the number simply to house ""every single person on the subway,"" but rather the entire homeless population throughout the city, which is estimated to exceed 22,000. The group did not provide a specific number of homeless New Yorkers living in the subway system.
""The coalition has called for (hotels) to be used not only for homeless New Yorkers sheltering in the subway system, but also the many thousands more in congregate homeless shelters where social isolation is impossible and where Covid-19 is spreading,"" said Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the coalition. 
A complication is that some hotel rooms have been converted for hospital use. The city said it planned to convert 250 hotel rooms in five hotels into hospital facilities, the Daily News reported on March 19. 
Our ruling
Routhier said, ""We could open up tens of thousands of hotel rooms and offer every single person on the subway access to them. The mayor has absolutely to this point refused to do that."" 
The city already does contract with hotels to house New Yorkers facing emergency homelessness, and the number of homeless individuals the city has moved into hotels has increased since the onset of the pandemic. 
However, the number of rooms being used for this purpose is well short of the ""tens of thousands"" of rooms needed to house all of New York City’s homeless population. The main reason is the high cost.

Joe Biden","Joe Biden correct that Trump administration delayed, scaled back CDC reopening guidelines




If Your Time is short





The White House requested that the CDC revise its initial reopening guidelines because they were “too prescriptive.”


The CDC later released around 60 pages of detailed reopening guidelines, but certain sections were cut.


The CDC said that the review and revision were part of a standard process with the White House coronavirus task force but some experts criticized the delay.





See the sources for this fact-check




Joe Biden berated President Donald Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying in a recent speech in Delaware that Trump failed to take the necessary steps to get the virus under control.
Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said the administration stifled and scaled back the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s initial guidelines on reopening the country. 
""The CDC tried to develop clear guidelines about what the stages of reopening should look like — the administration delayed and scaled them back,"" Biden said June 30.
Did they? Here’s what we found out.
CDC asked to revise guidelines 
Biden’s campaign pointed us to a May 7, 2020, Associated Press report, which found that the Trump administration shelved part of a CDC document that contained step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen businesses and public areas amid the pandemic. 
The 68-page CDC report, titled ""Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,"" was supposed to publish on May 1, according to the AP, but the White House called it ""too prescriptive."" The White House told the agency revise its guide because it didn’t align with Trump’s strategy of giving states the final say. 
The CDC released the approved 62-page report on May 20. (Some sections were released a few days earlier.) While it’s slightly shorter than the original, it still provides a detailed reopening roadmap for schools, camps, restaurants, child care facilities and transit organizations. 
In a May 8 press briefing, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany countered that the CDC guidelines weren't ready and said that a rogue employee leaked a draft that was still in the editing process.
After the final guidelines were released, she was asked in another briefing why Trump didn’t make an announcement. McEnany said that sections of the document were already out and different appendixes had to be discussed first.
""The 60-page document was merely an aggregation of a lot of what was already out there, so it’s not as if this was new information that we were announcing, but it was more guidance pursuant to our ‘reopening of America’ guidance that was issued several weeks ago,"" McEnany said. 
The CDC also said the guidelines are meant to be taken together with the White House’s reopening guidance issued on April 17, 2020. But the White House version makes clear reopening decisions are up to state and local officials, while the CDC’s version includes more details, such as recommendations to help businesses decide when to shut down in the case of future outbreaks.

The original plan also included instructions for faith-based organizations, which were stripped out of the final version.  
CNN reported that this section was one of the main holdups for publishing the CDC documents, because the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights argued that faith-based organizations were being unfairly targeted. The department asked the CDC to ease social distancing recommendations for those groups, according to CNN, and encouraged federal health officials to let churchgoers congregate, saying that this aligned with the president’s agenda.
The shelved CDC guide also recommended that nonessential travel should be avoided until the last phase of reopening, while the released version only mentions nonessential travel in relation to high-risk persons. The White House plan is looser on nonessential travel, too, and advises that communities ""minimize"" travel in Phase 1, and that in Phase 2, ""non-essential travel can resume.""
Some health experts and officials have criticized the delay, saying that detailed recommendations should have been available earlier.
""While it is not unusual for there to be White House review of forthcoming guidance, it is highly unusual for there to be a wholesale rewriting of guidelines at the request of the White House,"" said Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University. 
""The holding back of recommendations regarding places of worship was particularly egregious given the high level of risk such indoor, mass gatherings can pose,"" Levi said. ""The shorter versions that were first released diminished their effectiveness, since they didn’t provide as much detail as people needed to know how best to implement them. This delayed implementation of best practices — which could potentially have placed people at greater risk.""
But the CDC told PolitiFact the report’s revisions were part of a standard interagency process with the White House coronavirus task force.
""There is an iterative effort to ensure effective, clear guidance is presented to the American people,"" said Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the CDC. ""As part of the Administration’s whole of government approach to combating COVID-19, the CDC followed an inter-agency process of drafting considerations and submitting them to the White House Task Force for review and comment before posting the guidance for states to safely reopen.""
PolitiFact reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back.
Our ruling
Biden said that the Trump administration ""delayed and scaled back"" the CDC’s COVID-19 reopening guidelines. 
Biden is mostly on target. The CDC said that the delays were caused by review and revision that was part of a standard process. Still, the White House did request that the public health agency revise its initial guidelines to align more with Trump’s approach of leaving reopening decisions up to state and local governments.

Jay Inslee","Are stay-at-home orders 'laws,' as Jay Inslee said?




If Your Time is short



• Many stay-at-home orders have been issued in the form of executive orders or proclamations, including Inslee’s, making them different from a typical law that is passed by the legislature and signed by the governor.
• However, experts say executive orders, proclamations, and similar orders carry the same weight as legislature-passed laws, because they have been issued under the authority of existing legislature-passed laws.



See the sources for this fact-check




Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who issued some of the earliest social-distancing orders of any governor to combat the spread of the coronavirus, took issue with President Donald Trump’s tweeted solidarity with protesters in several states who were demanding an end to stay-at-home orders.
On April 17, Trump tweeted, ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN,"" ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA,"" and ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA,"" apparently referring to demonstrations at state capitols where protesters called for lifting restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
On the April 19 edition of ABC’s ""This Week,"" host George Stephanopoulos asked Inslee, a Democrat, for his reaction to Trump’s tweets.
Inslee responded:
""We have an order from governors, both Republicans and Democrats, that basically are designed to protect people's health, literally their lives, (only) to have a president of the United States basically encourage insubordination, to encourage illegal activity. These orders actually are the law of these states. And, again, these are not just Democrats. These are Republican-led states as well. To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law, I can't remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing.""
We wondered whether it’s accurate to call state stay-at-home orders ""laws,"" and whether they conflict with freedoms of speech and assembly under the First Amendment. So we asked legal experts.
They agreed that while most fall under the heading of ""proclamations"" or ""executive orders,"" they were issued under legal authority delegated by legislatures, meaning that have the same practical effect. The orders also would have a good chance of being deemed constitutional in court, they said.
What have governors ordered?
By now, most states have issued a stay-at-home order and/or requirements for business closures. (The National Governors Association has the complete list.) 
However, most of these were not laws passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — the typical way of passing a state law. Instead, many of them have been made through executive orders, such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, and Illinois. Others have been made in the form of a ""proclamation,"" such as the orders in Louisiana; a ""directive,"" as was issued in Utah; or simply an ""order,"" as in Idaho.
In Inslee’s case, he signed a proclamation establishing stay-at-home rules for Washington state.
A spokesman for Inslee said, however, that the proclamation was tantamount to a law, because it was made under authority delegated to the governor’s office by another law that had been passed the conventional way.
Inslee’s order was enacted under Washington’s emergency powers law, which authorizes him to ""proclaim a state of emergency"" and make a series of prohibitions pursuant to that emergency, such as ""prohibiting ... any person from being on the public streets.""

Washington's Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, appeared on the April 19 edition of ABC's ""This Week""
Orders still carry the force of law, experts say
Experts told PolitiFact that despite the linguistic and procedural differences between orders and law, the stay-at-home orders effectively carry the force of law.

""Calling it ‘the law of the state’ is fair,"" said I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School professor. ""Statutes passed by legislatures are what most people think of when one says ‘laws,’ but from a lawyer’s point of view, a common-law decision by a judge, a regulation, or an action by the governor would all qualify broadly as ‘the law.’""
James G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University, called it ""entirely accurate"" to consider an executive order to be a law.  Laws can be derived from a constitution, a statute, a regulation, case law, ""or orders implemented through legal means, including emergency powers invoked by governors.""
One thing many orders have in common with laws is enforcement power.
Under Inslee’s order, certain violations can result in a misdemeanor. Several other states — including California, Hawaii, Michigan and Oregon — explicitly label violations as potential misdemeanors. New Jersey specifies that violators could be subject to disorderly-conduct charges, carrying imprisonment of up to six months or a fine. (The National Governors Association has a list of selected states’ enforcement powers here.)
Just because law enforcement has arrest power in many of these states doesn’t mean they’ll be eager to use it.
""Police can and do enforce stay-at-home orders, but arresting violators and jailing them would defeat the purpose of the order,"" said Nicole Huberfeld, a professor of health law, ethics and human rights at Boston University School of Public Health.
Inslee’s spokesman, Mike Faulk, said his boss is not eager to use law-enforcement powers.
""Do we want to bring charges against people? No, we never have,"" Faulk said. ""That’s why we are focused on education and soliciting voluntary compliance before taking legal or regulatory action.""
What about the First Amendment?
Gubernatorial stay-at-home orders do pose special concerns for First Amendment rights, particularly freedom of assembly. But fundamental rights can be trumped by public health concerns, experts said.
In the 1905 case Jacobson v. Massachusetts, for example, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that a mandatory vaccination law was a legitimate exercise of state power to protect public health and safety.
As for the First Amendment, there are several longstanding exceptions, including the famous ""falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic"" exception, which dates back to the unanimous 1917 decision in Schenck v. United States.
""Time, place, and manner restrictions on speech, including protests, so long as they are not targeted to a particular message, are frequently upheld,"" Huberfeld said. In addition, she said, ""government authority to protect public health, safety, and welfare tends to be read more expansively during an emergency. While silencing people totally would be questionable, during a pandemic that involves a highly contagious disease, the government may find it necessary to prevent public gatherings until such gatherings are deemed safe by health experts.""
Hodge agreed. ""The government can shut down protests to the extent they involve physical gatherings of persons in violation of specific state-based emergency orders,"" he said. ""Rights to speech and assembly do not constitutionally include endangering the health of others, especially in pandemic circumstances involving an easily spread, deadly condition like COVID-19.""
Our ruling
Inslee said that stay-at-home orders ""actually are the law of these states.""
Technically, many have been issued in the form of executive orders or proclamations, rather than a conventional law passed by the legislature and signed by the governor. However, a broad range of legal experts said that executive orders, proclamations and similar orders are equivalent to legislature-passed laws and can be enforced in essentially the same way, and in tandem with existing laws such as disorderly conduct.

Kim Reynolds","Existing research shows lower rate of children getting, spreading COVID-19




If Your Time is short





Children do contract the coronavirus but current research shows it is happening at a much lower rate than for adults.


Children in available studies also have been less likely than adults to spread the coronavirus.


Iowa’s governor cited these factors, plus general acceptance from educators and pediatricians that in-person learning is better for children, in her call to re-open K-12 schools for the 2020-21 school year. 





See the sources for this fact-check




Iowa, like many other states, faces a calendar-driven fact: the beginning of another school year. The state’s governor, Kim Reynolds, says schools should re-open for students who do not have health conditions that would put them at risk if exposed to the novel coronavirus. 
""Kids are less likely to get it,"" Reynolds said at a July 14, 2020, news conference about children’s susceptibility to the virus, COVID-19. ""They’re less likely to spread. So I think there’s some pretty good data out there that will help alleviate some of the concerns.""
PolitiFact has visited this topic previously, stating that children can catch the virus but that their symptoms aren’t as potent as those in older people. And, President Trump has called forcefully for schools to re-open for the next school year.
Deciding to re-open schools that have been closed since mid-March in Iowa while the coronavirus pandemic continues has been a balancing act. Parents and teachers are dealing with the virus’s health threat on students, teachers and staff but also fear negative effects on children isolated at home instead of learning face-to-face with teachers and interacting with other children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association and the School Superintendents Association are on record saying interaction is necessary but also caution against moving unsafely when reopening schools.
While there’s no mistaking that a child ill with the virus would deal with discomfort, or in a worse scenario serious health risks, existing research backs up Reynold’s statement about the virus’ incidence rate and spread rate for children and research backing that up.
In Iowa, 5% of people testing positive for COVID-19 as of July 15 were 17 or younger, state data showed on July 16, 2020. That’s lower than the national rate, which shows 10% of Americans testing positive for COVID-19 were age 17 or younger, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed July 16. Almost one-half of Iowa’s COVID-19 cases were detected in people ages 18 to 40. 
Researchers concluding, to date, that young children are at less risk than older adults of catching or spreading the virus include:


An international research team conducting studies in China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. They concluded that the risk of transmitting the virus under the age of 20 could be as much as one-half the risk for those over the age of 20. They published their findings June 16, 2020, with Nature Medicine.


Doctors and researchers at Mayo Clinic, of Rochester, Minnesota. ""While all children are capable of getting the virus that causes COVID-19, they don't become sick as often as adults,"" the clinic’s COVID-19 section on its website states. ""Children also rarely experience severe illness with COVID-19. Despite many large outbreaks around the world, very few children have died.""

A World Health Organization-China joint report from February 2020.


Skepticism has existed about the WHO-China report, especially when testing only was done in hospitals. Also, some researchers caution that infection and transmission rates among young people aren’t as high as they are for adults because the youths have not been exposed as much as adults to the virus. And that CDC data? It shows a higher percentage of people age 17 and younger who are tested for the virus showing up positive.
Part of the reason for those CDC numbers is that fewer children than adults have been tested, and that what testing has been done has been with children suspected to be at risk. ""Our data is skewed originally to people with symptoms, and then skewed to adults over 18,"" Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a July 8, 2020, White House news briefing. More in-depth study of COVID-19’s affect on children is needed, she said. 
Five days later, German researchers released a study of students in their country who were exposed to each other in school that, the researchers said, could indicate that COVID-19 might not spread as much among the youths as feared. 
Pediatricians at Dresden University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus said they reached their conclusions after studying blood samples taken in May and June from 1,541 youths mostly in eighth through 11th grade. The samples were from 13 secondary schools and part of a 2,045-sample test that also included teachers, the researchers said.
Our ruling 
Reynolds said, ""Kids are less likely to get it (COVID-19). You know, they’re less likely to spread. So I think there’s some pretty good data out there that will help alleviate some of the concerns.""
Reynolds’ assertion is supported by the bulk of the existing research, which shows that scientists have seen lower COVID-19 infection rates among young people and have not seen the virus spread among children at the rate as high as the ones for adults.
However, researchers have only been able to study the virus since late January 2020, and they are learning more about it by the day. There may also be statistical quirks affecting the data, such as the limited extent to which children are being tested for the virus.

But reports from the World Health Organization and the U.S. CDC found that mild cases account for 75-to-80% of all cases.

Amid the spread of the novel coronavirus, many people are wondering how likely they are to get it.
Often, their second question is: If I get coronavirus, how likely am I to survive it?
One chart, created by the website Information is Beautiful, says that 80% of coronavirus cases are ""mild.""

So is that true?
The chart is a tad misleading. It makes a blanket statement about the virus while basing its claim on a study by China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and a website called Statistica. The post doesn’t include links to the reports.
An important note: The percentage of mild cases shouldn’t be confused with your likelihood of surviving a stint of the virus, also known as COVID-19. Mortality rates differ depending on a person’s age and health.
The virus is relatively new. So there’s a lot researchers have yet to nail down. That said, the post is mostly consistent with available data.
So far, most cases are mild
In February, CNN reported on the release of the study conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology.
The study itself said that in confirmed coronavirus cases, 70% were ""normal,"" 25.5% were ""severe"" and 4.5% were ""light.""

But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of World Health Organization, said during a press conference on Feb. 17 that more than 80% of patients ""have mild disease and will recover.""
Meanwhile, 13.8% of cases suffer severe symptoms and 6.1% are critical.
What the CDC says
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website on March 13 said a ""complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully known."" However, the CDC said ""most cases"" are mild, citing a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
That study looked at medical records for coronavirus patients documented by the National Health Commission between Dec. 11 and Jan. 29.
""On admission, the degree of severity of COVID-19 was categorized as nonsevere in 926 patients and severe in 173 patients,"" the study reads. That means 84 percent were considered non-severe.
Age and baseline health were factors in whether a patient’s illness became severe, the study said. 
""Patients with severe disease were older than those with nonsevere disease by a median of seven years. Moreover, the presence of any coexisting illness was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with nonsevere disease,"" it said.
Our ruling
The chart says 80.9% of cases are mild. It’s important to note that different age groups have had different levels of severity.
However, generally speaking, the chart is on track. We found that mild cases account for roughly 75-to-80% of cases, according to studies published by the WHO and CDC.

Joe Biden","What Joe Biden said about the coronavirus in January




If Your Time is short



• Biden expressed concern about the coronavirus weeks before Trump did, and as early as January, he recommended following the Obama administration’s approach on Ebola, including international cooperation and the use of sound science.
• In a January op-ed, Biden referred to “the possibility of a pandemic” and said the number of cases would increase, though he was not more specific on timing or steps to counteract the virus. 
• Biden offered his first detailed plan on March 12, the day after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.



See the sources for this fact-check




When presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden appeared on the July 20 premiere of Joy Reid’s MSNBC show, ""The ReidOut,"" he repeated an assertion about how he was more aware of the risks of the novel coronavirus early on than his opponent, President Donald Trump.
Referring to Trump, Biden said, ""I, all the way back in January, warned him this pandemic was coming. I talked about what we needed to do.""
Other news outlets have previously fact-checked similar assertions by Biden, but we’ll take a crack at his newest remark on Reid’s show.
We found that Biden did warn about a potential pandemic as long ago as January, and talked about some steps the administration should take. A fuller, detailed plan came weeks later.
The USA Today op-ed
Biden’s primary warning about the coronavirus came in a USA Today op-ed he published on Jan. 27, which was six days after the first coronavirus case in the United States was announced. 
Here are the op-ed’s key passages about the novel coronavirus:
""The possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president. … The outbreak of a new coronavirus, which has already infected more than 2,700 people and killed over 80 in China, will get worse before it gets better. Cases have been confirmed in a dozen countries, with at least five in the United States. There will likely be more. … To be blunt, I am concerned that the Trump administration’s shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic that will come sooner or later.""
While Biden told Reid that he had ""warned"" Trump that ""this pandemic was coming,"" his January op-ed did not word it so definitively. In the op-ed, Biden referred to ""the possibility of a pandemic"" and he said one ""will come sooner or later.""
The World Health Organization did not declare a pandemic until March 11. Trump was tweeting as late as Feb. 24 that the coronavirus ""is very much under control in the USA.""
Still, Biden’s wording in the Reid interview suggested that his warnings were more definitive than they were.
His comment to Reid that he ""talked about what we needed to do"" as far back as January was more big picture than specific.
Much of the op-ed set forth the ways in which the Obama administration, which Biden served as vice president, handled the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak, including marshaling a cooperative international response and relying on sound science for decision-making. Biden contrasted the Obama playbook with the ways that Trump, then a private citizen, ""sought to stoke fear and stigma"" about Ebola.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







International cooperation and a reliance on science are big-picture elements of fighting a disease outbreak in its early stages. Biden also wrote in the op-ed that, as president, he would ""ask Congress to beef up the Public Health Emergency Fund and give me the power to use the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to declare a disaster if an infectious disease threat merits it. I will also renew funding — set to expire in May — for the nationwide network of hospitals that can isolate and treat people with infectious diseases, and fully fund the Global Health Security Agenda so the world is ready for the next outbreak.""
Beyond that, Biden did not offer much specificity for battling the coronavirus in January, when public-health officials around the world were just beginning to grasp the nature of the virus and the steps that would be required to contain it. 
In the U.S., public-health officials were beginning to contemplate the potential need for extensive social-distancing measures in February and early March. Biden held an in-person rally in Detroit as late as March 9 before canceling a rally for the first time on March 10. The following day, the NBA abruptly suspended its season, triggering a cascade of cancellations of events and gatherings around the country.
On March 12, Biden offered a more detailed plan. In remarks posted on Medium, Biden thanked those ""who are already making sacrifices to protect us — whether that’s self-quarantining or cancelling events or closing campuses."" 
He went on to say that fighting the coronavirus ""will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings.""
Biden also urged free testing for everyone who needs it; making sure communities have the hospital beds, staff, medical supplies and personal protective equipment needed to treat patients; efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Defense Department to provide temporary hospitals; and fast-tracking of vaccine clinical trials by the National Institutes of Health and approvals by the Food and Drug Administration.
Biden’s plan came four days before the White House issued recommendations that senior citizens and people with serious health concerns should stay home, initially for 15 days.
The White House formally declared a national emergency on March 13.
Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact that an op-ed was not the venue to flesh out a full plan; it was intended more as an outline.
Our ruling
Biden said, ""I, all the way back in January, warned (President Trump that) this pandemic was coming. I talked about what we needed to do.""
Biden expressed concern about the coronavirus weeks before Trump did, and he recommended the Obama approach on Ebola, including international cooperation and the use of sound science, in January. He warned of the possibility of a pandemic several weeks before the WHO declared one, and predicted that there would be more cases in the U.S. 
But while he spoke broadly in January about how the U.S. should approach the crisis, he did not offer a detailed plan until March 12, a day after the WHO declaration.

Andrew Cuomo","What Gov. Cuomo got right about disparity between states in COVID-19 funding




If Your Time is short



• In the first round of federal funding for health care providers, New York state has received far less money than less-affected states, according to an analysis by Kaiser Health News. 
• Cuomo addressed only one segment of the stimulus aid, and glossed over the distinction between states and the health care providers within those states. The funding source he tweeted about sends money directly to providers, not to states.
• Subsequent batches of funding are supposed to favor states with higher coronavirus case loads.



See the sources for this fact-check




New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose daily press briefings on the state’s battle against the coronavirus have drawn wide coverage, has extended his rhetorical reach through social media.
On April 12, Cuomo took to Twitter to spotlight what he saw as a disparity in federal funding between New York and states that had fewer coronavirus cases.
""Some states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case. New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case,"" Cuomo tweeted. 
 
 
We found that the statement relies on a credible study of how one part of the federal funding is being divided among the states, though it glosses over the fact that it’s counting money going to health care providers directly, rather than to the states themselves.
Comparing the number of cases
The number of coronavirus cases changes by day, and even by the hour. But at the time he made his claim, Cuomo was correct to say the difference between New York and the other two states was lopsided.
New York has been hardest hit by the coronavirus. On April 12, the state reported a cumulative 195,031 known cases of the virus. 
Montana and Nebraska, which have far smaller populations, saw much smaller outbreaks of the virus at the time: Montana had 394 reported cases, while Nebraska reported 792. 
Comparing the federal funding
The money Cuomo is referencing comes from the $2.2 trillion federal coronavirus aid package passed in March, known as the CARES Act. 
While that bill earmarked $150 billion directly for state, local and tribal governments, the breakdown Cuomo is referring to comes from a different provision that provides funds directly to hospitals and other health care providers. 
This portion of the CARES Act allocates up to $100 billion to health care providers. When Cuomo sent his tweet, $30 billion of that total had been distributed.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, providers have received money from the stimulus bill based on a formula that involves how much money they received from Medicare reimbursements in 2019 (excluding payments under Medicare Advantage, which works through private insurers). 
HHS estimated that these Medicare reimbursements amounted to $484 billion in 2019. Because HHS wanted to push the first $30 billion of coronavirus aid out the door quickly, it allocated the money based on providers’ share of these reimbursements from 2019. 
In other words, the formula for this first stage of funding had nothing to do with the number of coronavirus cases a state was facing.
Using these guidelines, Kaiser Health News, a PolitiFact fact-checking partner, calculated how much money providers in each state had received from the $30 billion. The publication based these numbers on a House Ways and Means Committee funds breakdown and New York Times daily coronavirus numbers. 
The analysis was originally published two days before Cuomo’s tweet. 
According to Kaiser Health News’ published analysis, hospitals and providers in New York state were due to receive stimulus money amounting to $12,000 per coronavirus case at the time. 
Providers in states with fewer cases, such as Montana and Nebraska, had received over $300,000 per case, according to the analysis. 
So Cuomo’s tweet tracks what the Kaiser Health News analysis found, though it’s worth noting that the total amount given to New York providers in this initial round, nearly $1.9 billion, was significantly more than what went to the other states: about $111 million for Montana and $225 million for Nebraska, according to the authors of the analysis.
Jack Hoadley, an emeritus professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute, told PolitiFact New York that the Kaiser study’s methodology was sound. He added that later rounds should address this imbalance. HHS has said that the next wave of the $100 billion will take into account how many coronavirus cases each state has.
This ""should respond at least in part to the concern raised by Gov. Cuomo,"" he said, though ""more information is needed before we can assess the dollars-per-patient metric"" down the road.
Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the New York State Division of the Budget, told PolitiFact that ""the tweet relied on information from a Kaiser Health News article and quoted it nearly word for word. There’s no question that the facts are accurate and there is a disparity in the federal funding structure among states in this regard.""
Our ruling
Cuomo tweeted, ""Some states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case. New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case,""
In the first round of funding for health care providers, New York state’s providers received far less money per coronavirus case than other, less-affected states, according to a credible analysis. However, Cuomo’s tweet addressed only one part of the federal funding, and it glossed over the distinction between states and health care providers in those states. The funding source Cuomo tweeted about sends money to providers, not the state.

If Your Time is short



• McMurray’s Republican rival, state Sen. Chris Jacobs, did vote against a bill that provides paid sick leave to employees of non-essential businesses. 
• Jacobs argued that while he supports the concept of sick leave for workers with COVID-19, he thought the particular bill offered placed too much of a burden on small businesses.



See the sources for this fact-check




Democratic congressional candidate Nate McMurray recently took to Twitter to attack state Sen. Chris Jacobs, his Republican opponent, over a vote he cast on paid sick leave. 
McMurray and Jacobs are the two major-party candidates running for the vacant 27th District congressional seat. The vacancy emerged when Republican Rep. Chris Collins resigned following pleading guilty to federal charges in an insider trading case. Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison.
On April 8, McMurray tweeted, ""Forbes called my opponents billionaire uncle, ‘The face of corporate greed during the corona.’ My opponent has only about $70M. But true to form, he voted against paid leave for Covid19. Support @Nate_McMurray for Congress. Leadership Matters!""
 
 
McMurray’s campaign confirmed that the tweet referred to a state Senate bill, S8091, which passed the Senate on March 18 and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. It provides for certain employee benefits if the employee is subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19.
Among these benefits is paid sick leave during the government-mandated shutdown of non-essential businesses.
Jacobs voted against the bill. He was one of six senators who voted against it. All of the senators voting against the bill were Republicans serving in the Democratic-controlled chamber.

Jacobs issued a press release the day before the vote critical of the measure.
In the release, Jacobs called the bill a ""new burden on New York businesses that will significantly raise costs starting in 2021. These new requirements would mandate small businesses grant paid leave for employees for an extremely broad swath of activities not at all related to being sick, such as ‘immigration’ and to ‘prepare for or participate in any criminal or civil proceeding.’ The COVID-19 crisis will bring many small businesses to their knees.""
In a May 1 statement to PolitiFact, Jacobs said that he supports paid sick leave for workers coping with COVID-19 but voted against the bill because he thought it should have been presented differently. 
""S8091 was a poorly written bill because it imposed 100% of the cost onto small businesses, which are already fighting for their very survival during this coronavirus crisis,"" Jacobs said. "" I could not, in good conscience, vote for a bill which would put more financial stress on our already struggling small businesses.""
Jacobs said that if the bill worsens the environment for small businesses, more of them would close, and in the long run, employees of those businesses would suffer.

• Gillibrand’s number is backed up by a New York City comptroller’s office study that found that 53% of all “frontline” workers in the city are immigrants. 
• However, the comptroller’s definition doesn’t include government workers such as first responders and differs from the state’s definition of “essential workers.” So it is one way of analyzing the data, and other methods might produce a lower percentage.



See the sources for this fact-check




When President Trump announced a plan to suspend immigration to the United States, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted the news with her own assessment of the decision:
""Immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City,"" the Democrat wrote April 21. ""They're on the front lines of the battle against this pandemic. I stand with our immigrant communities now and always.""
With so much dependent on the group of people that have become known as ""essential workers,"" we wanted to look closer at Gillibrand’s statement to see if the numbers support it.
 
We found that while the statistics on this question are a little murky, one credible study does reinforce her assertion.
What is an essential worker?
Gillibrand’s communication’s director, Evan Lukaske, told PolitiFact that the senator was defining essential worker based on the way the New York City comptroller's office defined ""frontline workers"" in its March 26 report, ""New York City’s Frontline Workers.""
The comptroller’s report defined New York City’s COVID-19 ""frontline workers"" as grocery, convenience, and drug store workers; public transit workers; trucking, warehouse, and U.S. Postal Service workers; health care workers; child care, homeless, food, and family services workers; and cleaning service workers.
On March 20, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, and the New York State Department of Economic Development issued a guidance on the term ""essential worker,"" and it listed several categories of worker who would not be covered under the categories used in the comptroller’s report, including those working at airports, certain types of manufacturing enterprises, hardware stores, funeral homes, animal shelters, and banks.
Notably, the comptroller report’s ""frontline worker"" category includes only ""direct-service, mostly non-governmental employees,"" meaning that it doesn’t count most types of public employees. As a result, the report does not take into account police officers, firefighters, and other first responders.
So while Lukaske said that Gillibrand ""is using ‘frontline’ and ‘essential’ as synonymous, there is a discrepancy between the two terms, and an alternate definition could end up changing the demographic profile.

That said, the comptroller’s report provides one reasonable definition. So what does the report’s analysis show?
Looking at the data
According to the comptroller’s study, more than 53% of frontline workers are foreign-born, meaning they’re immigrants. Of the sectors studied, building cleaning services employs the highest share of immigrants at 70%. It is followed by health care and food and drug store workers, both at 53%.

 
Other studies have backed up the broader proposition that immigrants make up a significant portion of essential workers.
The Center for Migration Studies of New York, a think tank on international migration, has estimated that 1.8 million immigrants in New York state work in jobs the state considers ""essential businesses."" The think tank found that foreign-born workers make up 31.5% of workers in essential businesses in New York state, despite only representing 28% of the state’s overall labor force. (It is logical that New York City’s percentage would be higher, since immigrants represent a higher share of the population in the city than in the rest of the state.)
Nationally, immigrants make up a ""sizable"" share of essential workers in the fight against the pandemic, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute.
The group estimates that 6 million immigrants are working frontline jobs in health care, food production, and transportation, and another 6 million immigrants work in industries such as food services and domestic household services.
""You can assume that an immigrant-rich area like New York City might have higher shares of immigrants than the U.S. average in particular occupations,"" she said.
Meanwhile, U.S. Census Bureau data shows that immigrants represent about 45% of the total workforce in New York City. That’s in line with Gillibrand’s assertion, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center.
Our Ruling
Gillibrand said that ""immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City.""
This number is backed up by a New York City comptroller’s office study that found that 53% of all ""frontline"" workers in the city are immigrants.

Greg Abbott","How many coronavirus deaths are people over 65?




If Your Time is short




Texas health officials publish daily coronavirus numbers, including some details about deaths by age, race and gender — but only for cases where the death has been investigated. When Abbott made this statement, the death toll in Texas was 948, but less than half of those deaths had been investigated.
Of the deaths where age breakdowns are available, roughly 71% are people aged 65 or older. Age information is not available for the deaths still under investigation.




See the sources for this fact-check




In a press conference on May 5 in which Gov. Greg Abbott updated his reopening plan to add businesses such as hair salons and gyms, he recommended that at-risk populations ""remain at home if at all possible"" and avoid in-person gatherings, such as a church service, funeral or wedding.
""We strongly encourage at-risk populations to try to watch or participate remotely, remembering this very important point, and that is almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older,"" Abbott said.
Texas was among the first states to start reopening businesses and lifting restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, allowing retail stores and restaurants to open May 1 at 25 percent capacity. 
Abbott announced the latest set of reopenings Monday, expanding restaurant capacity to 50 percent and granting bars the ability to open at 25 percent capacity within the next couple weeks.
This comes as the state continues to see its number of infections and deaths rise and clusters form mostly in rural parts of the state where meatpacking plants are located. Hospitalizations, however, have decreased since mid-April.
With that in mind, we had to ask: Is Abbott right that almost 75% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are people older than 65?

Looking at the numbers
Abbott’s spokesman John Wittman said Abbott’s claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, which publishes daily numbers on the state’s COVID-19 testing and cases.
The data includes a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by age, race and gender, but only for those cases where the deaths have been investigated by the local and regional health departments. As of Wednesday, the majority, or 489, were still under investigation.
""The demographic data on cases and fatalities come from the case investigation forms submitted by local health departments and our regional offices,"" said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen.
The purpose of the investigation is to confirm that the person had COVID-19 but also to collect other details about them and the circumstances around their death, Van Deusen said.
Wittman said the data showed that 75% of investigated deaths were people 65 and older when Abbott made this statement.
""It alternates almost daily, but it’s generally around that range,"" Wittman said. 
As of May 6, the day after the press conference, the death toll in Texas was 948. Fewer than half, or 433, had been investigated.
Of those, about 71 percent were Texans 65 and older. It was still about 71 percent, or 345 out of 489 investigated cases, as of Wednesday. The age groups broke down like so:

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021









Ages 10 to 19 years old: 2 deaths, or 0.4%


Ages 20-29: 10 deaths, or 2.04 %


Ages 30-39: 9 deaths, or 1.8%


Ages 40-49: 21 deaths, or 4.29%


Ages 50-59: 54 deaths, or 11.04%


Ages 60-64: 45 deaths, or 9.2%


Ages 65-69: 59 deaths, or 12.06%


Ages 70-74: 45 deaths, or 9.2%


Ages 75-79: 45 deaths, or 9.2%


Ages 80+: 196 deaths, or 40.08%


Across the United States, about 79% of coronavirus deaths have been people 65 years and older, according to the National Center for Health Statistics data submitted between the beginning of February to the beginning of May.
Like Texas’ statistics, the national numbers are also incomplete. The number of deaths represent only those entered between those dates and only include people with confirmed or presumed COVID-19.
""While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of 7 days,"" the NCHS states on its website.
The data is also always somewhat behind because of the lag time between when a death occurred and when a death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. The delay can last anywhere from one week to eight or more.
Our ruling
Abbott said almost ""75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older.""
Of confirmed coronavirus deaths, close to 75% were people within the age group Abbott provided, but he failed to include the caveat that this statistic leaves out more than half of the total deaths that have not yet been investigated.

If Your Time is short





Some people have protested stay-at-home orders in recent weeks with public demonstrations.


During the flu pandemic in 1918, protesters formed an Anti-Mask League in San Francisco.


San Francisco was among several cities that experienced a second wave of cases.





See the sources for this fact-check




The protests against stay-at-home orders in some state capitals have drawn comparisons to the 2010 tea party movement, but the idea of protesting such rules amid a pandemic is not just a 21st-century phenomenon.
There are parallels to a protest a century ago.
""During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, several influential San Francisco residents including a few physicians formed the Anti-Mask League which objected to wearing masks to prevent the spread of influenza,"" stated an April 22 Facebook post. ""They held meetings of thousands of maskless people. San Francisco was ultimately one of the cities that suffered the most with a high death rate.""
(The ""Spanish flu"" is a misnomer — it’s more accurate to refer to it as the flu pandemic of 1918.)
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post includes a black-and-white photo of policemen wearing masks over their mouths and noses. We did a reverse Google search and found the image matches a photo of policemen in a different city — Seattle — wearing masks in 1918.
But there are accurate statements in the text, which draws from a source at the University of Michigan. We found that there was such a thing as the Anti-Mask League in San Francisco in January 1919. The city did have one of the highest death rates from the flu, but the authors said they can’t prove whether the Anti-Mask League played a role.
RELATED: What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing
San Francisco mask protest in 1918
Hat tip to NPR reporter Tim Mak for digging up the history of the Anti-Mask League and sharing it in a Twitter thread. Mak pulled from an essay by J. Alexander Navarro at the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine, a book by Alfred W. Crosby, America’s Forgotten Pandemic and the San Francisco Chronicle archives. 
As the number of flu cases rose in October 1918 in San Francisco, the city passed an ordinance requiring everyone to wear a mask in public except at mealtime.
Mask wearing was promoted as a symbol of patriotism. Gov. William Stephens told Californians it was a ""patriotic duty for every American citizen"" to wear a mask.
City officials and local newspapers reported widespread compliance with the mask order initially, Navarro found. But some resisted the rules, and police arrested 110 people on Oct. 27 for not wearing their masks or for failing to keep them properly adjusted. The majority were fined $5, though some went to jail.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







In November, with cases declining, the city started to lift restrictions, although it still required masks. People flocked to public venues including theaters and sports arenas. At a boxing match, the city’s mayor and city health officer were photographed not wearing masks, for which they were fined.
Later that month, the mayor annulled the ordinance. But new cases quickly emerged, and the mask ordinance was reinstated in January.
Opponents formed the Anti-Mask League, multiple news articles in January 1919 show. Crosby wrote in his book that the league consisted of ""public-spirited citizens, physicians and fanatics.""
At a meeting of the Anti-Mask League ""resolutions were passed denouncing the mask ordinance as contrary to the desires of the majority of the people,"" the San Francisco Examiner reported. Nearly 2,000 people attended.


The league got their wish, and the mask rule was rescinded Feb. 1.
San Francisco was among the hardest-hit cities
Navarro and colleagues studied how 43 cities fared during the 1918 pandemic and published their results in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They found that many cities experienced second waves after ending social distancing. 
San Francisco had one of the higher excess-death rates: 673 per 100,000 people.
""It is impossible to say for certainty that the advent of the Anti-Mask League played a role in that outcome,"" Navarro told PolitiFact ""Undoubtedly, having over 2,000 people gather would have helped continue to spread influenza.""
The main factors in San Francisco’s outcome, however, were failure to implement interventions such as social distancing quickly and failure to keep them in place long enough.
Navarro said he didn’t find something similar to the Anti-Mask League in other cities. Only a few other cities implemented mandatory face mask orders, while others recommended that the public use masks. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post said during the 1918 flu pandemic, San Francisco residents formed an ""Anti-Mask League."" San Francisco ""was ultimately one of the cities that suffered the most with a high death rate.""
Residents angry about the reinstatement of a mask order did form the Anti-Mask League in January 1919. It appeared to be short-lived, as the mask rule was quickly rescinded. Researchers found that San Francisco did have one of the higher death rates in the country, but it is impossible to say whether that was directly related to the mask protests.
A photo of masked police officers that accompanies the post is real, but it shows officers in Seattle.

Tony Evers","Has “Safer At Home” in Wisconsin saved 300+ lives?




If Your Time is short





We of course can’t know something like “lives saved” for certain, but this kind of claim is pretty standard in discussions of disease trajectory.


This claim lines up with projections made by DHS, and experts say it’s in line with what other models projected as well. 


But Evers neglects to describe this as an estimate or projection.





See the sources for this fact-check




Pushing back against a lawsuit seeking to block his ""Safer at Home"" extension, Gov. Tony Evers laid out his case for isolation measures in Wisconsin.
He said striking down the order would ""cripple our ability to respond to the pandemic."" Places without such measures, he said, have yielded ""reports of doctors rationing ventilators and having to choose which patients will live or die"" and ""reports of needing refrigeration trucks for the deceased.""
And he made a bold claim about the impact his shelter-in-place order has had in Wisconsin.
""It's working,"" Evers wrote in an April 21, 2020, Facebook post. ""We have flattened the curve here in Wisconsin and have prevented the death of at least 300 Wisconsinites, and perhaps as many as 1,400 lives.""
Disease experts have been clear that social distancing can save lives, but is Evers right about saving at least 300 lives?
We checked it out.
A hypothetical future
We’ll start out with the obvious: There’s no way for Evers to know this for sure. He is referring to a hypothetical scenario in which actions taken to this point never occurred. 
But this is a standard type of statement in disease management and other fields that use predictive models — comparing initial projections with actual observations later.
""It’s quite common to project with a model sort of what would be expected in epidemiology,"" said Patrick Remington, a former CDC epidemiologist and director of the Preventive Medicine Residency Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""What better way to predict than … to say, particularly early in an epidemic, what if we did nothing? The early transmission velocity in an epidemic, what if that were to continue throughout the course of the epidemic?""
We should also note this language is in line with claims from the other side of the aisle. 
President Donald Trump asserted in an April 16, 2020, news conference, ""Our experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.""
What the Wisconsin models said
The models used to project the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 are constantly evolving, tweaked to factor in the most up to date trends, new information about the virus and changes in government policies and society’s response to them. The models get better as more data on what is happening is added, which is why the wild swings in projected cases and deaths from early models have leveled out now.
Evers is comparing the number of deaths we’ve seen so far to what the earliest version of those models said would happen in Wisconsin.
So what did they say?
Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said his numbers were based on a model created by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







A version of that released March 18, 2020 projected between 440 and 1,500 deaths in Wisconsin by April 8. The actual death toll on April 8 was 99. Some quick subtraction shows that is in line with Evers’ claim.
""While early models of the virus’s spread are less reliable the further out they project, those models showed that, by April 8, Wisconsin would have seen 22,000 cases which would have resulted in 440-1,500 deaths,"" Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy DHS secretary, said in an affidavit filed in opposition to the Republican lawsuit. ""Therefore, we estimate that the First Safer at Home order saved between 300 and 1,400 lives by April 8th.""
Evers’ claim also lines up with early projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, a model that has been widely used by the government and public alike throughout the pandemic.
On March 25 it projected 853 deaths in Wisconsin over the following four months. Now that model projects less than half that number.
Another model, detailed in an April 24 report from Johns Hopkins University, said their simulations showed about three times as many deaths in Wisconsin by May 1 if ""Safer at Home"" had not been in place.
As of April 30, 316 people had died in Wisconsin of COVID-19, DHS reports.
Ajay Sethi, associate professor of population health sciences at the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, said the range of lives saved Evers cited is ""consistent with near-term forecasts I had seen.""
Remington agreed those figures are ""absolutely within the range of what I’d expect,"" noting that Evers was wise to cite it as a range since it is an estimate and based on many factors.
Crediting Evers
One key factor here is the matter of credit.
Just as the number of deaths is an estimate, so is figuring out how many of those lives saved were due specifically to ""Safer at Home.""
""You can’t tease out the effect of that order from the daily White House briefings to all the stuff on social media to late night comedy shows,"" Remington said. ""But you can say the result of all this public education is a change in our behavior.""
""Safer at Home"" was the cornerstone of the Wisconsin response to coronavirus, though, so it’s certainly fair to credit it with a large share of the change in behavior here.
""Without social distancing the virus would have continued to spread like wildfire,"" Sethi said.
Our ruling
Evers said his ""Safer at Home"" plan ""prevented the death of at least 300 Wisconsinites, and perhaps as many as 1400 lives.""
This claim lines up with projections made by DHS, and experts say it’s in line with what other models projected as well. And Evers was smart to cite a wide range of possible outcomes, since we have no way of knowing precisely how this theoretical future would have played out.
But any claim like this is based on a hypothetical scenario of how COVID-19 might have progressed in Wisconsin without the array of government limitations and changes in personal behavior we’ve seen in recent months. 
And Evers stated this as a knowable fact rather than an estimate.

Bill Clinton","Bill Clinton mostly accurate on international unemployment comparison




If Your Time is short




Clinton was accurate for the broadest comparison, which includes a 20-nation selection of OECD nations between January 2020 and June 2020. 

 
The rate in the U.S. was 3.1 times higher in June than in January. Only Canada came close, with the unemployment rate 2.2 times higher over that period.

 
The one caveat is that extending the U.S. data to July showed that the increase fell slightly below three times.




See the sources for this fact-check




In his Democratic convention address, former President Bill Clinton took a shot at President Donald Trump’s economic record during the coronavirus pandemic, saying the 45th president has botched his handling of the twin health and economic crises.
""Donald Trump says we’re leading the world,"" Clinton said. ""Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple.""
Using the most clear-cut multi-nation comparison — comparing January to June 2020 — Clinton is right. But it’s worth noting some differences in how countries address unemployment.
We turned to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank whose members are advanced industrialized countries. The group collects economic statistics for all its members, including unemployment rates. We chose 20 countries for which data was available, including most of the countries in western Europe, plus Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Israel. 
For consistency’s sake, we compared January to June because only two of the countries reported data for July. 
As the following chart shows, the United States was among the few countries to show a dramatic increase in the unemployment rate between January and June. The U.S. is the peach-colored line with the steep climb; you can see each country highlighted if you hover over the list of countries at the bottom.

The United States saw its unemployment rate increase from 3.6% to 11.1%. That works out to a little under 3.1 times higher in June than January.
No other country saw such a big increase. 
The only other nation that saw its unemployment rate more than double over that period was Canada, which saw its rate increase 2.2 times. Canada actually had a higher unemployment rate in June than the U.S. did, at 12.3%, but the scale of Canada’s increase was more modest than the United States’ because Canada had a higher rate to start, at 5.5%.

Using U.S. data for February instead of January doesn’t change the picture much. The U.S. unemployment rate in February was 3.5%, making the increase through June about 3.2 times.
There are a couple asterisks to Clinton’s statement.
If you compare January to July, a month for which data isn’t available for most of the OECD nations, the increase in the United States was still substantial, but just short of three times higher. The unemployment rate rose from 3.6% in January to 10.2% in July, meaning an increase of 2.8 times.
It’s also worth noting that the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen for three straight months, amid a zigzagging reopening and a volatile economy. So the unemployment rate is likely to bounce around a bit before it settles down.
Finally, the OECD itself notes some differences across countries. Some nations have used more aggressive efforts than the United States to subsidize workers to remain on payrolls. And some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not count ""temporarily"" laid-off workers as unemployed, while the United States does count such workers as unemployed.
Our ruling
Clinton said the United States is ""the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple"" since the coronavirus pandemic began.
That’s accurate for the broadest comparison — a 20-nation selection of OECD nations between January 2020 and June 2020. The rate in the U.S. was 3.1 times higher in June than in January. Only Canada came close, with the unemployment rate 2.2 times higher over that period.
However, extending the U.S. data to July showed that the increase fell slightly below three times, and there are some complications in making cross-country comparisons.

Rebecca Kleefisch","Yes, Wisconsin vaccine rollout among slowest in Midwest




If Your Time is short




At the time of this tweet, Wisconsin had dropped from second-last in the Midwest to last in the number of people vaccinated per capita.

 
Per capita rates are the only reasonable way to compare progress between states due to varying populations.

 
Evers did say he was ""satisfied"" with the progress, with the caveat that the state has not had access to the vaccine supplies it wanted or expected.




See the sources for this fact-check




Wisconsin’s vaccine distribution — like most everything else in Wisconsin in recent years — has sparked a partisan blame game.
Republicans have criticized the rollout as slow and uncoordinated, asserting Democratic Gov. Tony Evers doesn’t have a sufficient plan. Evers has countered that he’s doing the best he can with the available supply, claiming Vice President Mike Pence had promised vaccines from a federal reserve that didn’t actually exist.
Republican Rebecca Kleefisch, a potential 2022 gubernatorial candidate, said Evers is leading an effort that ranks among the worst in the region.
""Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in our vaccination rate and the governor says he’s ‘satisfied,’"" Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor under Gov. Scott Walker, said in a Jan. 14, 2021, tweet.
Does Wisconsin really rank that poorly?
Let’s dig in.
Wisconsin vaccine rollout among the worst
We’ll leave for another day the question of who’s to blame for the speed of Wisconsin’s vaccine rollout.
But the status is clear — Wisconsin is among the slowest in the nation. In fact, Kleefisch was over-stating the Midwest ranking.
State-by-state data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed 2.4% of Wisconsin residents received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine as of Jan. 13, the most recent data available when Kleefisch sent out her tweet.
That ranked dead last among the 12 Midwest states. North Dakota and South Dakota led that ranking with more than 5% receiving a first dose, while Ohio and Missouri joined Wisconsin at the bottom, with 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively.
In the preceding days, Wisconsin had ranked second-last in the Midwest.
Nationwide as of Jan. 13, Wisconsin ranked 41st out of all 50 states in vaccination rate, well off the national average of 3.1%.
The ranking only worsened in the ensuing week, with Wisconsin dropping to 44th by Jan. 19 while remaining last in the Midwest, according to the CDC.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Pushing back against Kleefisch’s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to CDC data on the raw number of vaccinations administered. That showed Wisconsin ranked seventh out of the 12 Midwest states as of Jan. 13.
But that’s not a reasonable way to compare progress when dealing with states that vary dramatically in population. It would be like arguing Texas is the highest-crime state because it has the most prison inmates. The latter may be true, but only because Texas has one of the highest populations. Comparing it to other states requires examining the number of inmates relative to the population (in which case Texas is not first).
That’s where the per capita rate comes in — which is the vaccination metric used by the CDC and referenced by Kleefisch.
Cudaback also said Wisconsin’s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process.
Yes, Evers called the progress ‘satisfactory’
That brings us to the second part of Kleefisch’s claim, that Evers is comfortable with where the state stands.
She’s off a bit there, at least in how she framed it.
In a Jan. 13 interview with WISN-TV, Evers was asked, ""Is this acceptable to you where we’re at"" as a state on vaccinations.
""Given what we have, we can’t give any more. That’s the issue,"" the governor said. ""Yes, I'm satisfied where we're at because that's all we had.""
So Evers isn’t necessarily saying he’s satisfied with being second-last (or last). He’s saying he is satisfied with the progress given what he has had to work with.
Whether that’s a valid excuse is a topic for another fact check, as there are of course vaccines on hand in Wisconsin that haven’t yet been administered. But he’s not quite using the word in the same way Kleefisch characterized it.
Cudaback also said Wisconsin’s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process.
Our ruling
Criticizing the rollout under Evers’ administration, Kleefisch said Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in vaccination rate.
Kleefisch is making the general point that Wisconsin is in worse shape than surrounding states, and that’s correct. But it’s in fact even worse than she asserted. After a stretch as second-worst in the Midwest, Wisconsin moved to last on that list shortly before Kleefisch’s tweet.
And Evers did say around the same time he was satisfied with the state’s progress, though he used the term with a caveat about vaccine availability.

In May, two weeks after crude oil prices turned negative for the first time in history, Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick spoke with the Texas Tribune giving updates on how the industry was handling the downturn.
""Last year, [oil and gas] was about 35% of the state's economy ... and so [because this industry] is down ... it's gonna affect everything,"" Craddick said.
Craddick repeated that same figure in a tweet earlier this month as she advocated for prioritization of the Railroad Commission — the state’s oil and gas regulatory agency — in next year’s state budget. 
""Oil and gas is 35 percent of the state economy, making the (Texas Railroad Commission’s) budget an important priority,"" she said.
Texas oil and gas producers have suffered the double blow of COVID-19 and the global price shock amid an era when the industry is facing a process of structural contraction. Oil and gas has long been a primary driver of Texas’ prosperity, but does its share of the state economy remain at 35% even after a historically tumultuous year?
Three tiers of economic analysis
Determining the oil and gas’ industry’s share of the state economy ""is a hard number to pin down,"" said Jesse Thompson, senior business economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
There’s a multitude of ways an industry’s economic impact can be measured, Thompson said. Impact could be an industry’s share of a state’s gross state product, or the number of jobs it creates, or the amount of income it generates, or some combination of the three. 
Furthermore, there are three different levels upon which economists analyze economic impact: an industry’s direct, indirect and induced effects on the economy. Direct effects include the revenue generated by oil and gas companies; indirect effects include the businesses supplying equipment or services to those oil and gas companies; and induced effects include the spending of people in the industry as a result of increased personal income. 
For example, induced impacts could include an interior decorator in Houston who is hired by an oil and gas employee.
""There’s a lot of very reasonable ways to break this up, that’s why there’s not necessarily a right answer,"" Thompson said.
Direct impacts are the most straightforward measurement. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal agency, the oil and gas sector directly comprised around 15% of the state’s gross state product between 2019 and early 2020. That share fell to around 14.2% as the coronavirus swept the globe and forced the industry to shed jobs and shut down drilling rigs in the second quarter of 2020, the latest period for which economic data is available.
According to Craddick’s spokesperson, the 35% figure Craddick cited represents the oil and gas sector’s direct impacts to the gross state product combined with its indirect and induced impacts. The 35% figure is also a projection for how the year will end after the industry’s bounce back from its April nadir. 
""We have seen improvements throughout the remainder of the year, so the number is definitely going to land somewhere between 30% and 40%, so 35% was an easy middle point,"" said Craddick’s Director of Public Affairs Mia Hutchens.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







Certain indicators are already showing the sector’s recovery. The Texas rig count has shown a slight uptick since October corresponding with an improving global demand for oil and natural gas. After nearly 60,000 oil workers lost their jobs between February and August, around 2,100 jobs were added in September and October, according to the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association. The association also projects that, by year's end, the industry will be supporting at least 300,000 direct jobs and 2.1 million indirect jobs in Texas.
The 35% projection was calculated using data from the Texas comptrollers office, the Texas Pipeline Association and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, the sector’s largest industry group in the state, according to Hutchens. 
At the beginning of 2020, before COVID-19 had reached all corners of the globe, the Texas Oil and Gas Association pegged the industry’s share of Texas’ gross state product at 30.5%. According to a spokesperson, the trade group determined that number by finding the sum of the industry’s direct contributions to Texas’ gross state product — $223.1 billion, or about 13.5% of the state economy. 
Then, to capture the industry’s indirect and induced ""ripple"" effects, the Oil and Gas Association multiplied the industry’s direct gross state product by 2.3, meaning that every dollar spent in the industry was modeled to generate $2.30 in spin-off economic activity. This multiplier produces an estimated $502.6 billion of economic impact in the state, or 30.5% of the private sector’s gross state product.
To Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, the association's method of calculation using a multiplier of 2.3 is ""pretty close to correct.""
""That’s not high. If anything that could be a touch low,"" Ingham said. ""I’ve heard commissioners in the past and other political types and other industry cheerleaders say the multiplier for oil and gas is 7.""
Underperforming years
Before the pandemic, Texas producers were coming off a couple of down years in 2018 and 2019.
In 2018, about four years after the global oil prices collapsed and slammed the brakes on Texas’ fracking boom, the industry was hampered by a credit crunch as lackluster oil prices remained volatile. By mid-2019, oil jobs were in decline as companies struggled to provide steady income and growth.
""It’s been the worst-performing sector on the S&P for the last couple years,"" said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. ""If you take the value of all the producers and add them together, by 2019 they collectively were worth less than Apple.""
According to Gilmer, there are ""at least three tough quarters in front of us"" before the industry will begin to reassert itself and shake off lasting effects of the pandemic. 
""By the time we get to 2022 — and it will take that long for us to feel really good about the economy — oil and the U.S. economy will be back,"" Gilmer said.
Craddick’s 35% figure reflects the commissioner’s belief that the industry will begin next year stronger than it began 2020. Although several indicators point to an upward trajectory of the industry — like oil prices, jobs, and rig count — Karr said the 35% projection may be slightly optimistic. 
""It’s a little hard to take issue with [Craddick’s number] just because it’s guesswork,"" Karr said.
Our ruling
Craddick said earlier this month that the oil and gas industry comprises 35% of the Texas economy. Craddick's office clarified that this figure represented the industry’s combined direct, indirect and induced economic impact, and that it represents a projection of how the industry will end the year after its recent bounce back. 
The oil and gas industry has comprised as much as 40% of the state economy during the last decade’s fracking boom, yet shrunk to 30% before the pandemic shocked the world economy. Firm quarterly data showing the industry’s recent gains will not be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis until late 2021.

Richard Durbin","How many DACA recipients are essential workers amid COVID-19 pandemic?




If Your Time is short





Sens. Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham introduced the Dream Act of 2021, legislation to help certain immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children.


The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, estimated that there are 202,500 recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals who work in essential jobs amid the pandemic. The number includes 29,000 who are frontline health care workers, and 12,700 in the healthcare industry holding jobs such as custodians, food preparers and management. 





See the sources for this fact-check




For two decades, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has advocated for passing the Dream Act to grant legal status to certain immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. As he made his case for the 2021 version of the bill, Durbin cited the role of these immigrants as workers in essential sectors.
""In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential infrastructure workers,"" Durbin said during a Feb. 4 Senate floor speech, referring to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed these immigrants to stay in the country without fear of deportation.
""That’s not my term — that is the definition of the Department of Homeland Security under President Donald Trump,"" Durbin said. ""Among these essential workers are 41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare industry: doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, respiratory therapists — all of them in a suspended immigration status because (the) Dream Act is still a bill, not a law.""
The number of DACA recipients who hold essential jobs during the pandemic has been a talking point for months among advocates of protecting these immigrants from deportation. A few think tanks — including one cited by Durbin — have tried to estimate their numbers, using varying criteria. Their estimates range from the tens of thousands to as many as 361,000.
Dream Act and Obama administration efforts
For two decades, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have crafted versions of legislation, sometimes called the Dream Act, that would offer a path to citizenship for immigrants who came here illegally as children. But despite bipartisan enthusiasm in Congress, the bills have stalled. 
In 2012, the Obama administration created DACA as an administrative program to protect these immigrants from deportation, as long as they reapplied every two years and met certain requirements. The Trump administration tried to rescind the program, but encountered legal hurdles. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden issued a memorandum directing federal officials to preserve DACA. There were about 641,000 active DACA recipients as of September.
Durbin and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced the Dream Act of 2021 to allow certain immigrants to earn lawful permanent residence and eventually citizenship if they meet conditions, including passing background checks, and pursue higher education, work lawfully for at least three years, or serve in the military.
Where DACA recipients work
Durbin’s spokesperson said his statistics about essential workers came from an April 2020 report about the demographics of DACA recipients by the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization.
CAP drew from a March 2020 memo by the DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency identifying essential critical infrastructure workers during the pandemic. 
The analysis by CAP included workers in health care, education and food-related jobs, although CISA’s list also included jobs in other areas such as transportation. CAP also drew on its own analysis of Census data to estimate how many people were DACA recipients, and looked at Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational classifications to come up with its employment numbers.
""Across the country, 202,500 DACA recipients are working to protect the health and safety of Americans as the country confronts COVID-19,"" the report stated. ""They are ensuring that children are still being educated; food is still being grown, packaged, cooked, shipped, and put on the shelves of grocery stores; patients are being cared for; and much more.""

CAP found that 29,000 DACA recipients are frontline health care workers, while an additional 12,700 work in the healthcare industry as custodians, food preparers ormanagers, among other jobs. Durbin arrived at his figure of 41,700 by adding those two groups. 
We sent the CAP report to the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for low levels of immigration. Steve Camarota, the group’s director of research, said that some of those CAP counted as health care workers are not on the frontlines of the pandemic, such as dental assistants or technologists or technicians for veterinarians or ophthalmologists.
""Honorable work to be sure, but not vital to fighting COVID,"" Camarota said.
CAP said its analysis includes 6,000 health technologists or technicians, including dietetic technicians, pharmacy technicians, psychiatric technicians, surgical technologists, veterinary technologists and technicians, and ophthalmic medical technicians.
But CAP’s numbers aren’t out of line with other groups that have come up with estimates of DACA recipients who work in essential industries:


The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, concluded that there were between 72,000 and 361,000 essential workers among DACA participants in 2020. The range is based on various definitions of essential industries.


The Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank devoted to studying international migration, concluded there were about 43,500 DACA recipients in health care and social assistance industries and tens of thousands in other essential industries including transportation, warehousing, retail, manufacturing and waste management.


The New American Economy, a bipartisan group of mayors and business leaders that seeks an overhaul of national immigration policy, found there were 62,600 DACA-eligible individuals in healthcare.


Our ruling
Durbin said ""More than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential infrastructure workers"" including ""41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare industry.""
Durbin was drawing from an April 2020 report from the liberal Center for American Progress. The statistics come with some caveats, including that they are estimates and include a broad swath of workers in healthcare, including some who aren’t on the front lines of treating COVID-19 patients. Even so, the numbers he cited are lower than some estimates by other groups.

Mandy Cohen","Is there a correlation between North Carolina's mask law and its coronavirus cases?




If Your Time is short




Mandy Cohen, Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services, says there’s a “direct correlation” between NC’s mask law and COVID-19 stabilization in late July.
North Carolina's stats show that the number of new coronavirus cases started to dip about three weeks after the mask mandate.
It's fair to say there's a correlation, experts told us. But there's not enough evidence to say the two are linked.




See the sources for this fact-check




North Carolina’s top health official says there’s evidence that a statewide mask requirement is helping stabilize coronavirus cases in the state.
In a press conference on July 28, Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said:
""Our actions to slow the spread of this virus are having an impact. Specifically, we see a direct correlation to the start of the statewide mask requirement at the end of June. Two to three weeks after implementing this requirement, we started to see the beginning of these more stable trends.""
Is it true that there’s a ""direct correlation"" between North Carolina’s mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization?
Data shows that the number of new reported COVID-19 cases is beginning to stabilize. Experts told PolitiFact the mask law and case count could be related, but that it’s hard to quantify the law’s impact.
Cases leveling
Gov. Roy Cooper announced the mask requirement on June 24 and it went into effect on June 26.
Cohen said North Carolina’s case count started to level about three weeks later. Why is Cohen judging the rule’s effectiveness three weeks after its implementation, rather than immediately after its implementation?
It can take up to 14 days between the time someone was infected and the time they start showing symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means someone could have contracted the virus before the mask mandate, but not shown symptoms or tested positive until after the mask requirement was in effect.
So let’s look at North Carolina’s case counts.

One way experts measure coronavirus trends is by calculating the 7-day rolling average for the number of new cases or deaths per day. The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and WRAL both track this metric.
The average number of new cases per day rose until about July 18, when DHHS reported 2,481 cases. The daily count started to drop after that date, and the rolling 7-day average has been less than 2,000 cases ever since.
What experts said
So Cohen is right that the number of new cases is stabilizing. Is that a direct result of the mandate?
There’s evidence that widespread mask-wearing has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, as we’ve previously reported. 
We spoke with experts at the University of North Carolina, Harvard University, the University of Nebraska and the University of Toronto.

While they agreed that there may be a correlation, they say there’s not enough evidence yet to determine how much influence the mask rule had on the stabilization.
Other factors -- such as social distancing or testing availability -- could also play a role.
But reviewing that data typically takes months, said Ryan McNamara, a research associate in UNC’s Department of Microbiology and Immunology. 
""There's just a lot of variables at play that need to be accounted for,"" he said.
There’s a popular saying in research: ""correlation does not mean causation."" In this context, it means that the mask law may not have caused the dip in new COVID-19 cases, even though there are signs a cause-and-effect relationship could exist.
""That said, Dr. Cohen and her team are in possession of much more data than I am. I think her statement was carefully worded and has scientific merit.""
Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, agreed that it’s premature to directly credit the mask rule for the leveling-off of cases. 
But he believes Cohen’s claim is fair, given that ""other data that (shows) masks work and accounting for numerous caveats such as what else happened 2-3 weeks ago.""
Dr. Barry Bloom, a research professor of public health at Harvard University, said it’s ""difficult to disaggregate a single intervention from the other standard public health behaviors.""
However, Bloom said it’s possible that the mask requirement not only prompted more people to wear masks -- but to start taking other precautionary measures as well.
""I think it is safe to say they may have contributed to the more stable trends, assuming the trends are indeed stable for a couple of weeks,"" Bloom said. 
As of August 3, the state’s rolling 7-day average remained below 2,000 cases and was still declining.
Our ruling
Cohen said there’s a ""direct correlation"" between North Carolina’s mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization.
Based on the data available in late July, experts said there does appear to be a correlation, but it’s too early to draw conclusions about it. Verifying the strength of the correlation can take months.

Joe Biden","Has COVID-19 killed more cops than all other causes?




If Your Time is short





Two separate groups find that more law enforcement officers died from COVID-19 than all other causes, including gunfire and car accidents.


Corrections officers are included in the tally.





See the sources for this fact-check




At the Republican National Convention, President Donald Trump cast himself as a stalwart friend of police and an effective leader in the fight against COVID-19.
In a speech in Pittsburgh, Democratic nominee Joe Biden said Trump was neither.
""Do you feel safer under Donald Trump?"" Biden asked Aug. 31. ""More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.""
That stat raised eyebrows, and we checked to see if it was true. Biden didn’t say exactly what the best data show, but the comparison is largely accurate.
Tallies of deaths by two national groups show that COVID-19 has killed more law enforcement officers than gunfire and other hazards of the job in 2020. The caveat to Biden’s claim is there is some statistical fuzziness regarding who is a cop and what it means to be on patrol. 
Roughly one-third of these tallies include corrections and detention center officers who work inside institutions where the virus can spread more readily. Some Customs and Border Protection field officers and other first responders are also included. While these occupations are counted as part of law enforcement, they might not come to mind as the cops that Biden referred to. 
The COVID-19 death toll is still the greatest single cause of death when those occupations are excluded.
What the broad numbers show
The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Fund lists 101 dead officers from COVID-19 compared with 87 from anything else, including gunfire, car accidents or other causes. If it weren’t for COVID-19, officer deaths were on track to be lower this year than last.
The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Fund says on its website that before it adds an officer to its list of deaths due to the virus, ""substantive evidence will be required to show the death was more than likely due to the direct and proximate result of"" exposure in the line of duty.
Another source, the Officer Down Memorial Page, shows 101 deaths from COVID-19 and 81 deaths from all other causes. Communications director Jessica Rushing said the count is updated daily.

(The Fraternal Order of Police has tracked 208 deaths from COVID-19, but not fatalities from other causes. It notes that it doesn’t verify the COVID-19 deaths.)

According to Rushing’s group, gunfire is the second most common cause of death. 

By a factor of three, COVID-19 is the leading cause of death for the broad group of officers.
That has as much to do with the pattern of police fatalities as it does with the virus, said Rutgers criminologist Frank Edwards. Deaths in the line of duty due to any cause tend to average about eight each month. 
FBI data on deaths in the line of duty further back this point. The FBI numbers distinguish between accidental and felonious deaths of officers in the community. They show that in a typical month, criminal acts kill less than five officers a month.
Excluding the corrections and detention officers, the toll from COVID-19 remains at about 70 in the Officer Down count — still double the loss of life due to gunfire, but not higher than the sum of other causes of death.
Our ruling
Biden said that more cops have died from COVID-19 than while on patrol.
COVID-19 by itself has killed more law enforcement officers than all other causes combined, according to two groups that track these numbers.
No matter how we parsed the data — by excluding correctional and detention center officers, or by focusing on felonious deaths to officers that could be considered ""on patrol"" — COVID-19 posed the greatest single threat to officers’ lives.

Democrats rejected a Republican amendment that would have barred prisoners from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks.


Democrats said the plan would hurt the families of prisoners, making it harder for them to pay their monthly bills.


Both parties supported past stimulus bills that sent checks to prisoners.





See the sources for this fact-check




In the long hours of debate before Senate Democrats passed their sweeping COVID-19 relief package, Republicans offered amendments designed to put Democrats on record on very particular policy points.
Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., put forward one that would prevent $1,400 stimulus checks from going to prisoners. The amendment failed on a party-line vote.
Cotton tweeted that this was another example of spending tucked in the bill that had nothing to do with pandemic.
""Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,"" he tweeted March 6. ""They haven’t lost their jobs, they aren’t worried about paying rent or buying groceries.""
 
Cotton repeated his point March 8 on Fox News, saying ""every single Democrat"" wanted to send checks to prisoners — invoking Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Charleston, S.C., church shooter Dylann Roof.
The record shows that Democrats rejected the amendment to prevent payments to prisoners.
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said it would harm prisoners’ families.
""Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and brown families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration,"" Durbin said on the Senate floor. ""Children should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated.""
Prisoners qualify for stimulus payments because of broad eligibility requirements in this relief bill — and others. Prisoners must be a citizen or legal resident, and either need to have filed a tax return, possibly as part of a joint filing, or complete an Internal Revenue Service form requesting payment. 
It’s worth noting that the two previous rounds of stimulus checks during the Trump administration — in the CARES Act in March, and the supplemental package in December — allowed prisoners to receive checks, too.

Cotton voted for both of those bills.
His press secretary James Arnold said circumstances were different. In the CARES Act, the issue was ""an unanticipated problem,"" and in December, there was no opportunity to amend the bill.
The issue had come up before.
In 2009, President Barack Obama’s economic recovery package barred stimulus checks for most prisoners. Only a few thousand got them, through an exception in the law for those who had just gone to jail.
In 2020, Washington put a priority on getting checks to people as quickly as possible. The CARES Act kept the eligibility rules broad and simple. Basically, anyone who was an American citizen or permanent legal resident, wasn’t claimed as a dependent by someone else, and had filed a tax return (or didn’t need to because they made very little), could get a check.
With the December bill, Republicans could have added a prisoner ban to the legislation before it came to an up-or-down vote.
The issue of prisoners and stimulus checks had long been in the news. Earlier in the year, the IRS blocked CARES Act payments to prisoners. That prompted a class action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people, arguing that the IRS rule was arbitrary and unlawful.
In October, a federal judge ruled against the IRS and said the government had to issue the checks. The judge ruled that the CARES Act had no language restricting payments to prisoners, and the administration couldn’t invent one. That only applied to the CARES Act, but the point is, Republicans had ample opportunity to grapple with the issue as the December bill was being written.
Despite having the right to stimulus checks, many prisoners hit a stumbling block: The IRS sent the inmates debit cards that some states couldn’t process. 
Our ruling
Cotton said Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to people in prison.
They did, arguing that to do otherwise would harm the families of prisoners. It’s worth noting that Cotton and other Senate Republicans voted for previous relief packages that also resulted in prisoners getting checks.

Wisconsin’s response to the coronavirus outbreak is under a microscope as cases surge and Republicans and Democrats continue to clash over what -- if anything -- to do about the increase.
Tensions boiled over July 30, 2020 after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide face mask mandate, despite opposition from Republicans who contend the move amounts to government overreach. 
In the days before that, though, the state Senate’s Democratic Committee turned its frustration toward Republican lawmakers.
""While neighboring states like Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have already implemented safety precautions like requiring individuals to wear masks, similar pleas in Wisconsin have fallen on deaf ears of Republican legislators,"" stated a July 24 news release.
Lawmakers in those states have passed more COVID-19-related bills than Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Legislature since the pandemic began. But some precautions, like a mask mandate, came from executive orders and not legislation. 
How does the committee’s claim stack up?
What Wisconsin has done (or not) 
Eric LaGesse, executive director of the Senate’s Democratic committee, did not respond to PolitiFact Wisconsin’s request for evidence to back up their claim. But the claim is pretty straightforward, and there has been a lot of news coverage of the state’s response to the pandemic. Here’s a recap:
In March, Evers and Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm issued a series of orders to curb large gatherings as COVID-19 began to emerge in Wisconsin. Those actions culminated in a stay-at-home order on March 24, 2020, which shut down the state to help contain the virus’ spread.
In April, lawmakers passed a coronavirus relief package that allowed the state to tap into extra federal Medicaid dollars and suspended a one-week waiting period for collecting unemployment benefits, among other provisions. However, the state lost $25 million in federal funding for unemployment because Republican leaders waited too long to schedule a floor session on the relief package. 
Evers’ administration extended the stay-at-home order on April 16 and four days later unveiled the Badger Bounce Back plan, which provided a phased approach for reopening based on testing and other public health criteria. In May, acting on a lawsuit from state GOP leaders, the state Supreme Court struck down much of the order and allowed the state to reopen without any protocols in place.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







After that, not much happened at the state level until the mask mandate despite a recent surge in infections and multiple daily increases of over 1,000 cases.
Lawmakers have introduced 10 bills related to the pandemic in recent months, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The relief package we mentioned earlier is the only one that’s passed.
What about our neighbors?
The Democratic committee argued neighboring states -- specifically Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan -- have implemented more safety precautions for their residents.
According to a database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures, Minnesota enacted 25 pieces of legislation related to COVID-19 through July 23 after lawmakers introduced over 200 measures. Illinois has passed 18, and Michigan approved 19. The bills touch on a wide range of issues, from COVID-19 testing to election procedures.
The differences between Wisconsin and its neighbors can’t be blamed on partisan gridlock, either. While Democrats control Illinois’ state government, Minnesota’s legislature is split between both parties with a Democrat in the governor’s office. Michigan, like Wisconsin, has a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature. 
It’s worth noting, though, that some of the precautions in other states came about through executive orders by their governors, not action by the legislature. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzer, for example, issued an order on June 26 requiring residents to wear face coverings -- over a month before Evers enacted a mask mandate in Wisconsin. 
Governors in other states also enacted stay-at-home orders similar to what Evers implemented.
Our ruling
Wisconsin’s state Senate Democratic Committee claimed Republican lawmakers have failed to act while ""neighboring states like Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have already implemented safety precautions like requiring individuals to wear masks.""
It’s clear that Wisconsin lawmakers are behind the curve on COVID-19 compared to neighboring legislatures. Legislative bodies in Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have introduced and passed more bills since the pandemic began. 
But they didn’t act alone, and safety precautions like mask mandates were ordered by their governors. 
That leaves us with a statement that’s accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Veterans groups in Pennsylvania typically prepare for Memorial Day by placing small American flags beside the headstones where fallen service members have been laid to rest.
When a state lawmaker from Erie County learned that the coronavirus might scuttle that sacred tradition, he posted about it on Facebook.
""Gov. Wolf is not allowing companies that distribute U.S. flags to ship out orders to be placed at veteran’s graves for Memorial Day,"" Pa. House Rep. Brad Roae posted on Facebook on May 11.
We wondered whether Wolf had really blocked Pennsylvania-based American flag distributors from operating during the pandemic.
Roae, a Republican, did not return a call seeking comment on his Facebook post, which has now been shared more than 7,000 times. But it looks like he was right.
Not only did Wolf exclude FlagZone, a manufacturer located in Gilbertsville, from his original list of life-sustaining businesses permitted to operate during the pandemic, his administration doubled down and rejected the company’s application for a waiver. 
FlagZone is one of the only American flag manufacturer in Pennsylvania and one of only a half dozen across the country. The company typically distributes more than six million small stick flags annually. 
Casey Smith, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development, told The Reading Eagle that the Wolf administration’s top priority is protecting the health and well-being of Pennsylvanians, and that flag-making, while patriotic, simply wasn’t ""life-sustaining.""
""Memorial Day celebrations and ceremonies are a staple in our nation, and many Pennsylvanians will need to adjust their routine this year to accommodate our new normal,"" Smith said. ""We encourage all Pennsylvanians to honor our nation’s fallen in their own special way.""

Turns out the flags had already been manufactured and were sitting in a warehouse.
FlagZone President Daniel Ziegler said it would only take a few workers to ship 400,000 flags that had been ordered by 24 different Pennsylvania counties in anticipation of Monday’s federal holiday. Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties were among those waiting to receive their orders. 
When State Sen. Scott Hutchinson learned about FlagZone’s woes, he also called on Wolf to ease restrictions imposed on the company.
""I see no reason why the time-honored and solemn tradition of placing flags at veterans’ graves could not be continued this year,"" Hutchinson, a Republican who represents Butler and other Western Pennsylvania counties, said in a statement sent to reporters via email. ""Certainly placing the flags in cemeteries could be done while practicing the social distancing Gov. Wolf recommends.""
On Monday, FlagZone got some good news.
The state cleared the way for the company to ship some flag orders even as it held firm that flag manufacturing is not essential during the pandemic.
""We’re just excited to get these flags out after months of being shut down,"" Ziegler told The Reading Eagle. ""Hopefully, when a family goes to the gravesite of a loved one who was a veteran they will now see that they were not forgotten.""
Smith, of the community and economic development department, said in an interview that special approval from the state is not required for limited shipping activities and communicated  that to FlagZone.

Roae posted on Facebook that Gov. Wolf had blocked companies that distribute American flags from shipping orders ahead of Memorial Day. Wolf initially blocked FlagZone from operating during the pandemic and then rejected the company’s request for a waiver. A state official later said the company did not need special permission to ship limited numbers of flags.

Coronavirus







Ron DeSantis","Fact-check: Ron DeSantis says COVID-19 is a lower risk for school-aged kids than flu




If Your Time is short




COVID-related rates of hospitalization and death for children are lower than those of seasonal influenza.
The risk of complications for healthy children is also higher for flu than for COVID-19, but infants and children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.
Though the number of coronavirus cases among children has been relatively low, experts caution this could be because they have been at home and not in school.
Experts also caution that children could be spreaders of the virus, and many unknowns remain.

 



See the sources for this fact-check




Even as his state is a hotbed for COVID-19, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been pushing schools to reopen so parents have the choice of sending children back to the classroom or keeping them home to learn virtually.
The Republican governor has said children without any underlying health conditions would benefit from in-person learning and the stimulation and companionship of being among other young people. He has also made clear that he thinks these benefits far outweigh what he considers to be minimal risks.
""The fact is, in terms of the risk to school kids, this is lower risk than seasonal influenza,"" DeSantis said, during an Aug. 10 televised roundtable discussion on education.
DeSantis’ assertion got us wondering, so we asked the governor’s office what evidence it had to back up the claim.
Looking at the numbers
A spokesperson responded with data from the Florida Department of Health showing the state’s COVID-19 mortality rate is 0.02% for people 24 and younger. That’s the same as the influenza mortality rate for this age group.
But for children 14 and younger, the spokesperson said, Florida’s COVID-19 mortality rate is 0.009%, far below the 0.01% for flu for that age group.
And the risk of death is not the only concern children face if infected by the COVID-19 virus. They can develop complications that require hospitalization.
""The risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""However, infants and children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.""
The CDC estimates there were 480 deaths among U.S. children due to flu in the 2018-19 season, including 136 cases where the virus was confirmed by laboratory testing.
As of mid-August, 90 children died of COVID-19 in the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
More than 46,000 children were hospitalized for flu in that 2018-19 period. The hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children.
The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 is 6 per 100,000 children for those ages 5 to 17, according to the CDC.
The number and rate of COVID cases in children in the United States steadily increased from March to July. ""The true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness,"" the CDC wrote recently.
While children have lower rates of using a ventilator than adults, 1 in 3 children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States were admitted to the intensive care unit, the same rate as for adults, the CDC said.
Dr. Chad Vercio, chair of pediatrics at Riverside University Health System in California, said DeSantis’ statement is partly true, with many caveats. Children’s risk from COVID-19 ""entirely depends on how widespread COVID is in any area,"" he said.
Data reflects a snapshot in time
U.S. hospitalization rates for children with COVID are lower than for those with flu, Vercio said. But that could be due to parents keeping children home and schools being closed since March, he added. ""It is unknown if these COVID hospitalization rates would rise when we open schools,"" he said.
About two-thirds of Florida school districts have opened in the past two weeks with the rest planning to resume by Aug. 31. Most districts are offering in person classes while giving parents the option to keep students home for virtual learning. In South Florida, where the pandemic has hit hardest, districts are planning to at least initially only offer virtual teaching.

“The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION recently reversed its stance on children getting the Covid vaccine.”












By Victoria Knight • June 24, 2021







Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, had initially planned to reopen classrooms but reversed itself after doctors warned that school closures were likely to ensue. The county revised its plan to limit classes to only online instruction, but the state’s Education Commissioner rejected that approach, saying it denies parents the option of sending their children back to school. Fearing loss of millions in state funding, the district now plans to begin virtual learning for all students on August 24; and, on August 31, begin offering students the option to return to the classroom. 
""The direct impact of COVID-19 on children is currently small in comparison with other risks and that the main reason we are keeping children at home is to protect adults,"" concluded a report in the British Medical Journal published in June. Still, health authorities say parents should make sure children practice good hygiene and limit playtime with other children.
Based on data from February through mid-May, the report found 44 deaths from COVID-19 for people 19 and younger in France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Spain, England and the United States. In a typical three-month period, there would be 308 deaths from lower respiratory tract infections, including flu, in those countries.
""At this stage of the pandemic, COVID appears to be less dangerous for children than influenza,"" said Sunil Bhopal, a co-author of the report and an academic clinical lecturer at Newcastle University in England.
""We don't need to wait for a whole season because, even at its peak in most countries, COVID killed a smaller number of children than estimated influenza deaths averaged from across a year,"" Bhopal said.
""While flu is likely to have caused more deaths than COVID, this may change as the pandemic progresses and major caution is necessary to ensure this doesn't change,"" said Bhopal, an honorary assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Dr. Sean O’Leary, professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said the growing number of U.S. deaths could be another reason to think about COVID-19 and children.
""We do know for sure that schoolchildren are major drivers of influenza epidemics in the community and, though that is not as much the case with COVID, it doesn’t mean they can’t spread it,"" he said. 
DeSantis also maintained that kids are less likely to spread COVID-19 than they are the influenza virus. However, experts cautioned that there’s still a lot that is unknown about children’s ability to transmit the virus to the people they interact with — parents, grandparents and even their teachers. The perceived risk for teachers, for instance, is at the root of a lawsuit between the state’s largest teacher’s union and the DeSantis administration. The Florida Education Association wants a Leon County judge to stop the state’s order forcing school districts to open classrooms for in-person learning by the end of August. 
Dr. Gabriela Andujar Vazquez, an infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said children are more likely to have zero or mild symptoms from COVID-19 compared with adults.
""The bottom line is kids can get infected and they tend to have less severe disease,"" she said. But the concern over reopening school is that children could spread the disease to others, including adults who are more likely to develop complications.
""Because schools are tied to the community — they are not in a bubble — and if community spread is not controlled in the community, it’s likely the school will reflect that,"" she said. One factor that can determine if disease is out of control is if positivity rates for people getting tested for COVID are over 5%. Many Florida counties have been well above that mark since June, although the rates have been dropping this month.
Back-to-school risks will be handicapped based on the ability of the school to adopt physical distancing measures and enforce wearing of face masks, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Utah Health and Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital.
""This fall, we may see a lot of kids get infected as schools reopen, and those could be just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""Even though most kids have mild or asymptomatic cases, what I worry about is just how big is the tip of the iceberg,"" Pavia said.
He also noted there is a vaccine for flu — which about 50% to 70% of children receive. ""The vaccine is not perfect but does reduce the impact of the disease, and with COVID everyone is at risk and susceptible,"" Pavia said.
Dr. Vidya Mony, an infectious disease expert with Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, California, said data suggests COVID-19 is not as bad for children as flu and that children are not the main driver of the pandemic. But, she said, there isn’t enough data yet to say indisputably that the COVID-19 risk is lower. ""We are learning something every day with this.""
Our ruling
DeSantis said that COVID-19 is a lower risk for schoolchildren than is seasonal influenza.
Studies show the number of COVID-related deaths and hospitalizations among children is lower than flu averages. Still, it’s uncertain if these lower rates among children were partly because schools were closed since March and whether those rates will rise as classrooms reopen this fall. It’s also unclear whether opening schools — particularly in communities with a high number of people testing positive — will lead to more spread of the disease.

Joe Biden","Joe Biden said there is no 'game plan' to distribute coronavirus vaccine. Is he right?




If Your Time is short




As of early August, the federal government has no public plan showing how it plans to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine.

The CDC and the National Academies of Sciences are working on recommendations for vaccine distribution. 


The Defense Department will handle logistics for the vaccine, but the CDC will handle tracking patients.


The CDC told states to submit their vaccine plans by the end of September. 





See the sources for this fact-check




Scientists have expressed cautious optimism that a vaccine will be ready in the spring of 2021 (and President Donald Trump has hinted at an even more aggressive timeline). But that has raised a key question: Does the federal government have a plan to distribute it?
Former Vice President Joe Biden says no. 
""If the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan they have,"" Biden told associations that represent Black and Hispanic journalists Aug. 6. ""How would everybody in America have access to it? It is a gigantic problem to distribute, even if we have it, and that’s what we should be planning for now, not when we get it.""
The federal government has not yet released a plan about how it will distribute vaccines. But in the past two weeks, federal officials have spoken about vaccine distribution planning, including the role of the Defense Department. And committees are working on recommendations about how to distribute the vaccine, while the CDC asked a few to join a pilot program to plan for distribution.
""There is no national COVID-19 vaccination distribution plan, yet. So that is true,"" said Michael Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
Most of the experts we spoke with said the government’s efforts have been too slow, and states face too many unknowns to do their part in planning to vaccinate millions of people. 
""This is going to be the most challenging, complex mass vaccination program ever attempted,"" said Dr. Kelly Moore, who works at the Immunization Action Coalition and ran Tennessee's H1N1 vaccination program.
Two committees working on recommendations
It’s not yet known precisely when the vaccine will be available to the public. Six vaccines are in the third phase of testing that involves thousands of patients. Like earlier phases, this one looks at the safety of a vaccine, but it also examines effectiveness and collects more data on side effects.
Results of the third phase will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. After the FDA licenses the vaccine, recommendations will be given about who should get the vaccine, and distribution will follow, said Dr. Carol Baker, a pediatrician who is an alternate liaison to a COVID-19 vaccines working group.
Federal health officials have generally predicted that the vaccine will be available in early 2021. 
There are two committees working on recommendations for the CDC about vaccine distribution.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a long-standing committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, formed a COVID-19 vaccines working group in April. The group’s next meeting on Aug. 26 will be publicly live streamed. Recommendations about who should get the vaccine first are expected by the fall.
The committee has wrestled with questions about whether to prioritize groups who have been infected at higher rates, such as Black and Latino people. Another difficult question is defining who is an essential worker. 
""There is no right answer there,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, a liaison to the working group. ""Grocery store workers vs. long haul truckers vs. people who work to keep the electrical grid up ... you can go on and on. Your priority list is valid, but so is mine.""
In July, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine formed a committee to help make a plan for vaccine distribution. 
Some experts told us it’s unclear why there are two separate committees working on the same task, while others said the CDC group will be the key group to make recommendations to the CDC.

Defense Department role
One key question has been about Trump’s comments that the military would be involved with logistics of vaccine distribution, a first.
Trump told reporters July 28 that the military is ""all mobilized. It’s been fully set up. When we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It’ll be a very rapid process all over the country.""
But a McClatchy report the next day cast doubt on Trump’s statements. Two defense officials told McClatchy that the military commands most likely to be involved in a delivery strategy had not been asked to prepare one. A Health and Human Services official told McClatchy that military help may not be required at all, and it would be the exception, not the norm.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







A Biden campaign spokesman pointed to the conflicting statements to argue that no distribution plan exists.
Following McClatchy’s article, administration officials held a conference call with reporters about vaccination distribution. (For our fact-check, the White House and other administration officials directed us to the transcript of that press phone call.)
A senior administration official said the Defense Department will handle the logistics of distribution and ""kitting,"" which means the packaging of the vaccine, along with related equipment, including needles, syringes and vials. The CDC will handle tracking of patients following vaccination and communications with state health departments. 
An official said that the distribution will be different from the seasonal flu vaccine because the government will actively target vulnerable groups, such as people in nursing homes and frontline health care workers.
State role in planning for vaccine distribution
Another key piece of vaccine distribution planning lies with the states. 
The CDC launched a pilot program with North Dakota, Florida, California and Minnesota as well as the city of Philadelphia to work on a vaccination response, according to a letter written by Nancy Messonnier, a CDC official, Aug. 4. 
While the letter says that the pilot program will be a model for other states, it doesn’t give states much time to receive and implement the best practices from that pilot program. 
The states have until the end of September to develop vaccination plans that will then be reviewed by the CDC and Operation Warp Speed, the federal government’s effort to fasttrack the availability of vaccines. Those plans should include mass vaccination clinics, signing agreements with providers and identifying high-risk communities that will require additional outreach.
""States must be allowed sufficient time to absorb what has been learned in these pilots and customize it to their own specific state and needs,"" said James Blumenstock, chief program officer for health security at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. ""Everyone questions if all of that can be done successfully between now and Sept 30.""
States can build off of their existing programs to administer childhood vaccines and the seasonal flu shot, and the H1N1 vaccine in 2009. But the delivery of COVID-19 vaccine poses some additional challenges. For example:


H1N1 was a single dose vaccine. The federal government has told states to prepare for a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine that will need to be administered likely three or four weeks later. 


While about 90 million people received the H1N1 vaccine, the federal government is planning for 300 million people to receive COVID-19.


Vaccines may have cold storage rules of around minus 80 degrees Celsius, far colder than other vaccines. ""We’ve never distributed a vaccine that required that before,"" Moore said. ""We don’t have a cold chain that exists currently that can take that.""


States have been directed to write plans for distribution without knowing important details about the vaccines and how much federal money they will receive to help with an unprecedented vaccination effort.
""Vaccination planning efforts are not as far along as they should be if the first COVID-19 vaccines actually do become available for shipping as early as late 2020,"" Moore said. ""Much of this delay has come from confusion at the federal level about who is directing the implementation of the national vaccination program. States cannot make firm plans with their private sector partners until these basic decisions are made at the federal level and until they are told how the federal government intends for vaccines to reach them.""
Our ruling
Biden said that ""if the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan.""
Biden is correct that there isn’t a detailed vaccine distribution plan written by the federal government at this time. But the vaccine isn’t coming out tomorrow, and a federal plan is in the works.
There are committees working on recommendations for vaccine distribution to include which groups should get the vaccine first. The CDC also asked four states and a city to pilot a program for vaccine distribution. Nationwide, states are expected to submit their own vaccination distribution plans by the end of September to the federal government.
There are a lot of unanswered questions that will affect vaccine distribution. But the planning is happening.

Garlin Gilchrist","Why are racial disparities in Michigan’s COVID-19 cases and deaths shrinking?




If Your Time is short





COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on Black people in Michigan, but the state has seen racial disparities in deaths and cases close as the pandemic has progressed. 


The change reflects a range of factors, including the changing geography of the virus, Black Michiganders’ embrace of mask-wearing, state and local efforts to reduce transmission in communities of color and the surge in white COVID-19 cases and deaths. 





See the sources for this fact-check




Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who chairs the state’s Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities, claimed that steps taken by communities of color, along with state and local efforts, have helped alleviate COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on Black residents.
""I’m proud to report that in the State of Michigan, we were able to really flatten that disparity and make significant progress,"" he said at an MLK Jr. Day Youth Conference.
Black residents make up 13.7% of Michigan’s population. But in April, they accounted for 42.93% of COVID-19 deaths, according to a Detroit Free Press analysis. That share has steadily decreased, and hit a low of 7.08% in November. Even during the second wave of the pandemic that began in the fall, the case rate among Black residents mostly remained below the rate for white people, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
Michigan seems to have bucked the national trend, as Black communities across the country continue to experience disproportionately high death rates.
Gilchrist said the shift ""is a tribute and a testimony, frankly, to people of color stepping up and doing the right things to keep themselves and their families safe."" He also credited local and state efforts to address COVID-19’s toll on communities of color.
It is impossible to know for sure what’s driving the trend. Experts we talked to backed up Gilchrist’s claim, but also pointed to other factors, including the way the pandemic has spread beyond the early hot spots.

The disparities have closed statewide. But Dr. Philip Levy, a professor at the Wayne State University School of Medicine, attributed the shift in part to Detroit. The onset of the pandemic in late March hit southeast Michigan hard, and Detroit — where the population is nearly 80% Black — became a hot spot. But the city is no longer leading the surge in cases and deaths in Michigan.
In early November, cases began raging in western Michigan. And in the late fall and early winter, the Upper Peninsula saw a big increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
In the most recent phase, Detroit has stood out for its low infection rate, even compared with the rest of the metro area.
""Despite the rise, Detroit has stayed down,"" said Levy. ""Something must be going on, and the secret sauce, I think, is in the people themselves.""
Detroiters were impacted early
Dawn Misra, an epidemiologist at Michigan State University who conducted a mortality review of Michiganders who died from COVID-19, said she suspects that the personal impact of the pandemic on the lives of Detroiters led the city’s residents to take the virus seriously.
""Everyone who lives in Detroit ended up being probably close to someone they knew who died,"" Misra said.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Levy said Detroiters’ early and personal experiences led them to embrace mask-wearing and social distancing. ""I think people really stepped up for their own personal responsibility and really recognized that they had an important role to play in this, and if people didn’t do that more people that they knew were going to die,"" he said.
Black Michiganders across the state have embraced mask-wearing. A survey conducted by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services over the summer found that 81% of Black Michiganders reported that they always wear a mask, compared with 69% of the rest of the population.
""They listened to the science,"" Misra said.
State and local efforts
Misra also credited state and local efforts to reduce racial disparities. For instance, as cases surged in Detroit, the city rolled out rapid testing for first responders, bus drivers and health care workers, becoming the first city in the country to do so. Levy helped launch a mobile testing program in Detroit that deployed vehicles to neighborhoods where cases were rising. These were among many efforts to ramp up testing in the city, said Misra.
In late April, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer established the task force to examine racial disparities during the pandemic. Michigan is only one of a dozen states with such a task force, according to the National Governors’ Association.
The state’s task force set up neighborhood testing sites in at-risk communities, launched media campaigns in urban communities on wearing masks and testing and provided personal protective equipment and food for quarantined individuals.
The virus got worse
But another factor in the narrowing racial disparity is the increase in cases in predominantly white areas in the state.
Jon Zelner, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said the worsening pandemic is an ""underappreciated factor"" in explaining the reduction in racial disparities. ""Some of the narrowing of that gap unfortunately kind of comes from an increase in overall case burden,"" he said.
""When you see white deaths going up, the ratio looks better,"" he added.
Our ruling
Gilchrist claimed that Michigan has seen significant progress in reducing the racial disparities observed at the outset of the pandemic, particularly the disproportionate impact on Black residents, and credited community, state and local efforts.
Public health experts and officials say Black residents as well as the state and local governments made significant efforts to narrow the disparity. But a surge in cases among white people has also contributed, as the impact of the pandemic spread beyond Detroit into predominantly white areas around the state.

Nancy Pelosi","Pelosi compares cost of state and local aid from coronavirus relief bill to 2017 tax cuts




If Your Time is short





Pelosi said that state and local aid in the Democrats’ proposed coronavirus relief bill would cost half as much as the Republicans’ 2017 tax bill.


State and local aid proposed by the Heroes Act would cost about half as much as the tax bill.


The statement doesn’t tell the full picture about what has caused increases in the national debt since 2017.





See the sources for this fact-check




To put the size of a Democratic-proposed coronavirus relief bill into perspective, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi compared its costs with the debt she says was incurred by the Republican-backed 2017 tax bill. 
Speaking to ABC News’ ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos about the Heroes Act, a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed by the House in May, Pelosi said, ""All of that money that is out there, and it is very significant, is half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt.""
We wondered if that’s accurate, so we reached out to Pelosi’s team to learn more about what she was referencing in her comment. We found that while her specific comparison has merit, it lacks context about the level of overall bipartisan support for measures that have added to the national debt.
Let’s take a look. 
Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, told PolitiFact in an email that Pelosi was referring to the portion of the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act that would provide aid to state and local governments. 
The so-called Heroes Act, which aims to provide money to state and local governments, small businesses, and households, received the support of just one Republican, Rep. Pete King of New York, while 14 Democrats voted against it in the House. The Senate hasn’t taken up the bill.
The legislation’s state and local aid would add $1.13 trillion to the deficit when calculated over a ten year period, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Hammill said that Pelosi’s phrase, ""half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt,"" refers to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which passed without a single Democratic vote in Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the act would add $1.8 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, or more than $2.3 trillion including added interest expenses on the national debt.
Using those figures, the state and local aid from the proposed coronavirus relief bill would cost 49% or 63% as much as the 2017 tax bill, depending on whether it's compared to the tax act estimate alone or with added interest. It gave tax cuts to corporations and individuals, and those cuts disproportionately benefit wealthier taxpayers.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said in an email to PolitiFact that Pelosi’s statement sounded accurate.
""If she was saying it how the speaker’s staff is characterizing it, yes, it is roughly half as much,"" Ellis wrote.
However, the impact of the 2017 tax cut is still a projection and might be affected by the recession, Ellis said. 
Pelosi’s statement is largely correct with respect to the tax cut bill, but it doesn’t tell the whole story of how other measures supported by both parties have contributed to increasing the national debt during Trump’s time in office. 
All told, Trump has signed legislation that has added $4.7 trillion to the debt since 2017, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That figure includes the 2017 tax bill, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ($445 billion), the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 ($1.7 trillion) and the 2019 spending deal that repealed Affordable Care Act taxes ($500 billion), among others. The 2018 and 2019 budget bills and the 2019 spending deal all received large numbers of both Democratic and Republican support. 
Our ruling
Referring to the proposed Heroes Act approved by the House, Pelosi said, ""All of that money that is out there, and it is very significant, is half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt.""
Pelosi’s statement has merit in that the state and local aid proposed in the Democratic coronavirus relief bill amounts to about half of the projected 10-year deficits created by the Republican tax cuts in 2017.
But it implies that Republicans alone are to blame for increases to the national debt. A broader look at legislation signed by Trump shows that both parties have supported legislation that has added to the national debt.

Coronavirus







Brett Giroir","Yes, at least five randomized controlled studies say hydroxychloroquine doesn’t help




If Your Time is short





Studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Spain looked at whether hydroxychloroquine prevented people from getting infected with the coronavirus, or helped them recover faster.


All of the studies randomly assigned patients to treatment and control (non-treatment) groups.


None of the studies found that hydroxychloroquine made a difference.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump and top health officials in his administration are now openly at odds over hydroxychloroquine.
Both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House task force, have said careful studies show the drug doesn’t speed recovery from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Still, at an Aug. 3 White House event, Trump said he has taken hydroxychloroquine and it is ""very highly thought of.""  Trump said the drug is politically toxic because he supports it.
On NBC’s Meet the Press, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health and overseer of the virus testing effort, said it is time to ""move on.""
""There have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to Hydroxychloroquine,"" Giroir said Aug. 2. ""So, at this point in time, we don't recommend that as a treatment. ""
We asked Giroir’s office to name the five studies he referenced in that interview. Not all of them used placebos, but they all randomly assigned patients to hydroxychloroquine treatment and conventional treatment groups. The drug proved itself in none of them.
Before we summarize the studies, a brief word about why this sort of study matters.
How to control for the unseen
If you want to know if a drug works, ideally the only difference between a patient who gets it and one who doesn’t is — no surprise — the drug itself. That’s harder to do than meets the eye. People aren’t identical. You can weigh them, look at their medical histories, check their blood oxygen levels and temperature, and yet, you still might miss something.
That’s where randomly assigning patients to treatment and non-treatment groups comes in.
""You don’t know all the possible things going on in the background and all that noise is what  randomizing helps filter out,"" said Boston University infectious disease modeler Brooke Nichols. ""It’s the best way to be sure that the only effect is the effect of the drug.""
Letting a computer program assign patients also prevents any subconscious choices by doctors from distorting the results. The whole approach is designed to take human foibles out of the picture.
To really minimize the human factor, not only do you randomly assign patients to groups, but the patients and the health care workers themselves don’t know what group they are in. So everyone gets a pill, but for half of them, the pill might be just sugar or something equally neutral. That neutral pill is a placebo.
""That’s the gold-gold standard of research,"" said Nichols. ""And just one one small notch below that is the randomized controlled trial without a placebo.""
Nichols said that the lack of a placebo takes on more importance when a non-placebo study comes up with different results than one with a placebo.
""When the results are in agreement, it doesn’t matter as much,"" Nichols said.
The studies
Giroir’s office sent us a list of the studies he had in mind. All of them used the randomized control approach. Two of them used placebos, and three did not. They all found the drug ineffective. Here’s Giroir’s list (plus a couple more we found ourselves):
A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Prevention of Covid-19 Transmission and Disease, MedRxIV, July 26, 2020. No placebo. This study out of Spain aimed to see if the drug prevented the disease. It involved about 2,300 people who had been exposed to someone who tested positive for the virus. After random assignment, one group got a dose of hydroxychloroquine for a week, and the other didn’t.

The differences were small, too small to be statistically significant. In the treatment group, 5.7% caught the virus. In the non-treatment group, 6.2% did. 
""Post-exposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection,"" the authors wrote.
Hydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin in Mild-to-Moderate Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, July 23, 2020. No placebo. This study from Brazil assigned 665 patients (504 with testing-confirmed COVID-19) to three groups: standard care, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine alone. 
""Among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care,"" the authors wrote.
Hydroxychloroquine in Nonhospitalized Adults With Early COVID-19, Annals of Internal Medicine, July 16, 2020. Placebo used. This study of 491 patients in the United States and Canada used two groups: one receiving hydroxychloroquine and the other a placebo. Participants either tested positive, or had the symptoms of COVID-19 and lived or worked with someone who had tested positive. They could not have had symptoms for more than four days.
""We hypothesized that starting hydroxychloroquine therapy within the first few days of symptoms could alter the course of COVID-19 by reducing symptom severity and duration and preventing hospitalizations,"" the authors wrote.
They found that the severity of symptoms after 14 days ""did not differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups."" 
No clinical benefit from use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, Recovery Trial - University of Oxford, June 5, 2020. No placebo. This study out of the United Kingdom randomly assigned over 4,600 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group and a standard care group. Researchers measured the death rate and symptoms after 28 days.
Among the treatment group, 25.7% died, compared to 23.5% for the standard care group. That was not statistically different. And there were no ""beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes.""
""Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs.,"" the researchers wrote.
The data has yet to be released.
A Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, June 3, 2020. Placebo used. This study focused on hydroxychloroquine as a way to avoid getting the disease. They randomly assigned 821 people with no symptoms — but who had spent time close to a person who tested positive — to a treatment or placebo group.
The hydroxychloroquine group was slightly less likely to test positive after two weeks, 11.8% compared to 14.3% in the placebo group, but the numbers were too small to pass statistical muster.
We found two other randomized controlled studies in addition to those Grigoir referenced. One out of Spain worked with 293 people with confirmed infections, but who were not hospitalized. There was no placebo. They found that hydroxychloroquine did not cut the risk of hospitalization, or help people recover more quickly.
An early study in May in Shanghai, China, assigned 75 COVID-19 patients to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group, and another received typical care. It also found no difference in the speed of recovery.
There has been one large study in Detroit that concluded that the drug worked. However, patient data in that study was collected after the fact and there was no randomized control process.
Our ruling
Giroir said there were five ""randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine.""
He is largely correct. There have been more than five randomized controlled trials that found hydroxychloroquine ineffective, either at preventing people from catching the virus, or helping them recover if they become ill. He exaggerated the number of studies that used placebos — out of his list, two did and three did not.
The infectious disease modeler we reached said placebos improve the quality of a study, but the lack of one matters less if the results are in line with placebo-driven trials.

Health experts vs. politicians
As for the whys of New Zealand’s success, both health experts and politicians can be credited — along with New Zealanders’ willingness to abide by stay-at-home orders — according to a number of news analyses.
National Geographic credited New Zealand’s success to mandatory quarantines for all visitors beginning March 15, which it called one of the strictest policies in the world at the time — even though there were just six cases nationwide. Just 10 days later, it instituted a complete, countrywide lockdown, including a moratorium on domestic travel. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ""made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals"" and citizens abided by the restrictions, wrote a reporter who became one of the quarantined visitors.
How strict? The lockdown from March 24 to April 9 allowed non-essential workers to leave home only for essential exercise within close proximity to their residences, Forbes reported.
""New Zealanders didn’t complain, they didn’t protest, they simply followed the rules,"" another foreign reporter who was in New Zealand for the lockdowns, wrote in Politico. When Ardern’s health minister took his family for a 20-minute ride to the beach, he was demoted, the reporter wrote.
Ardern announced the reopening of schools in May.
The BBC credited Ardern’s leadership as well as the presence of New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield at Ardern’s daily briefings. Bloomfield effectively explained complex health issues, and that made New Zealanders more compliant in following orders, the network reported.
The New York Times reported June 8, the day the New Zealand lifted its lockdown and declared the virus eliminated, that Ardern ""has been praised internationally for her approach to New Zealand’s outbreak, which was among the most stringent in the world.
""Her live video updates on Facebook, streamed from her own home, offered a relatable understanding of the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on the lives of New Zealanders, but a firm resolve to eradicate the disease from the country.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that ""New Zealand let health experts"" rather than politicians make decisions about how to deal with COVID-19, ""and as of today they have zero COVID cases.""
As of July 7, the date of the post, New Zealand reported having 22 active cases of COVID-19 — but each had been detected at the port of entry among people returning from travel abroad. In other words, the country had zero active, locally transmitted cases.
Health experts, along with New Zealanders’ compliance with stay-home orders, are partly credited for the success. But Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s decisions to order strict early lockdowns, following scientists’ advice, have won wide praise.

If Your Time is short



• The number of new infections and the pace of vaccinations have shown steady improvement during President Joe Biden’s tenure.
• The decline in cases began more than a week before Biden took office, and the pace of new cases and vaccinations did not change dramatically after he became president.



See the sources for this fact-check




The coronavirus pandemic isn’t yet approaching its end, but Democrats are expressing widespread relief that the Biden administration — and not the Trump administration — will be tackling the virus from here on out.
One post that attracted some 28,000 reactions reflected this sentiment.
Over a picture of a smiling Biden flashing the thumbs-up sign, the Feb. 19 post said, ""Boom! COVID-19 infections down 61% from Trump’s last day. COVID-19 vaccinations up 85% from Trump’s last day. Competence matters!!!""

 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Here is a chart showing the seven-day rolling average for new coronavirus cases between Jan. 1 and Feb. 21. The first 20 days of that period were under President Donald Trump and are shown in red, while the rest were under Biden and are shown in blue.

 
Cases fell by 65%, which is close to the 61% cited in the post.
However, it’s worth noting that the number of cases started falling about 10 days before Biden took office, and that decline did not appreciably accelerate after he took office.
As for vaccinations, they also increased steadily on Biden’s watch, but not at a significantly faster rate than they did in Trump’s final days.

The number of vaccinations on Feb. 19 was 88% higher than the number on Jan. 20, which is close to the 85% cited in the post. (The data show a decline in recent days that is due to a combination of slow reporting of data and delays caused by the winter storm that affected a broad cross-section of the country.)
In contrast to Trump, who was criticized for a lack of focus on the pandemic and for a reluctance to stand firmly behind policies urged by public health experts such as wearing masks, Biden made fighting the pandemic a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and promised a more science-based approach and a stronger federal hand in the vaccine rollout.
Still, experts cautioned against assuming that Biden deserves full credit for these statistical gains.
""I do not think it’s fair to say that Biden singlehandedly slashed coronavirus infections or caused vaccination to skyrocket, but he certainly didn’t seem to hurt the effort,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. 
It’s also too early to say that Biden’s initiatives are having an on-the-ground impact that can be easily identified in the data, said Natalie Dean, a University of Florida biostatistician.
""Although there have been some strong new initiatives put into place at the start of his term, these will take time to have an impact, particularly those related to vaccine rollout, such as ramping up manufacturing,"" Dean said. ""Operation Warp Speed deserves a lot of credit for the availability of safe and efficacious vaccines, and this initiative was started under Trump.""
John Sellers, the executive director and co-founder of the Other98, told PolitiFact that the group agrees that ""there are many factors playing a role on the trajectory of COVID vaccinations and infections."" He added that the post does not explicitly state ""that all these changes are due Biden.""
Our ruling
A viral image that features Biden giving a thumbs up says ""COVID-19 infections down 61% from Trump’s last day. COVID-19 vaccinations up 85% from Trump’s last day. Competence Matters.""
These specific figures are basically accurate, and both the number of new infections and the pace of vaccinations have shown steady improvement during Biden’s tenure. However, it’s important to note that the decline in cases began more than a week before Biden took office, and the pace of new cases and vaccinations did not change direction dramatically once Biden took office.

JB Pritzker","Did Pritzker lack authority to postpone the Illinois primary?




If Your Time is short




It’s difficult to know for sure that Pritzker could not have done anything to delay the March 17 election.

 

But experts told us the governor spoke correctly in describing the limits of his powers under existing law.




See the sources for this fact-check




The coronavirus pandemic has governors grappling with the implications of holding primary elections even as some are insisting everyone stay at home until the public health crisis subsides.
Of 23 states that have not yet held primaries, at least eight  are now postponed, according to news reports.
Illinois was one of three states that allowed voting to continue as scheduled on March 17, even after Gov. J.B. Pritzker closed schools, barred restaurants from serving dine-in customers and prohibited mass gatherings. Ohio, which was also scheduled to vote that day, shuttered polling places hours before they were set to open by declaring a public health emergency.
Following Ohio’s 11th-hour move, Pritzker responded to criticism from Chicago’s city election board over why he did not act to postpone in-person voting in Illinois.
At an Election Day news conference, Pritzker said the city’s board had asked him a week before ""to do something that is unquestionably not within my legal authority.""
""They wanted me unilaterally to cancel in-person voting on March 17, convert Illinois to an all-vote-by-mail state, and extend vote by mail to May 12,"" Pritzker continued. ""They could not even begin to explain the legal basis for their request.""
It’s impossible to say what would have happened had Pritzker’s administration forced a delay like Ohio’s, so calling it ""unquestionable"" is a bit of an exaggeration. But experts told us the governor’s on firm legal footing to claim he cannot — on his own — interfere with the democratic process.
The limits of emergency powers
During a state of emergency, which Pritzker declared earlier this month, public officials have broad authority to make drastic changes that may alter people’s daily lives and undercut businesses’ ability to operate.
For example, Illinois’ Emergency Management Agency Act allows the governor to control the movement of people within a ""disaster area,"" which in this case covers the entire state. It also permits him to seize property and suspend the sale of items such as alcohol or firearms. But it says nothing about postponing elections.
In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine acknowledged he also lacked the authority to delay an election, according to the Columbus Dispatch. So he backed an attempt to get a court to change the date. When a judge denied that request, his public health director ordered all polling places closed. That action prompted a legal challenge, but Ohio’s supreme court dismissed it, declining to stop the state from shuttering the polls.
Experts told us Pritzker’s administration may have been able to try something similar, potentially forcing the Illinois General Assembly to sort out a new date, as Ohio’s is now doing. But the experts warned that doing so could have set a troubling precedent for future elections.
""You can say that even though the motivations here (in Ohio’s case) were completely pure and even though the decision here was completely reasonable, this is a dynamic that is not particularly healthy to have a situation where a person who is elected himself is deciding not to hold elections,"" said Nadav Shoked, a local government expert at Northwestern University’s law school.

Indeed, Pritzker made a similar point during his press conference, warning ""it is exactly in times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else.""
When we asked his office why the governor’s administration had not tried to close polls like Ohio’s did, spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh responded in an email that ""breaking the law and then hoping the Supreme Court agrees with you isn’t how this administration prefers governing.""
A matter for the General Assembly
So who can set a new election date or shift voting entirely to mail-in ballots in Illinois?
Abudayyeh told us state lawmakers would have to pass legislation in order to make that happen. The legislature was not in session the week before the election.
The state’s election board also said it could not act unilaterally, noting in a March 16 press release that moving the election would require either a court order or legislative action.
""The Election Code is silent on the issue of canceling or postponing an election,"" spokesman Matt Dietrich told us in an email. ""It would require the General Assembly amending the Election Code to give us (or some other official or entity) such authority.""
Dietrich said the same goes for mandating election authorities send mail-in ballots to voters.
Experts said it stands to reason that state lawmakers must take action in order to alter how elections are conducted.
""Who represents the people of the state? It’s the state legislature,"" said Jaime Dominguez, an urban politics expert at Northwestern University. ""Voters are indirectly involved through their representative in the legislature.""
Our ruling
Pritzker said it was ""unquestionably"" not within his ""legal authority"" to postpone Illinois’ primary election by changing the date or shifting the election to vote-by-mail.
While there are too many hypotheticals to be certain Pritzker’s administration could not have delayed the election in any way, experts told us the governor spoke correctly in describing the limits of his powers under state law.

Mitch McConnell","How much goes to COVID-19 vaccines in the stimulus bill?




If Your Time is short





Estimates of vaccine spending in the American Rescue Plan bill range from $14 billion to $20 billion or more.


Total spending directly on COVID-19’s health impacts ranges from $100 billion to $160 billion.


The biggest spending in the bill includes $422 billion in stimulus checks for individuals, $350 billion for state and local governments, and $242 billion for unemployment benefits.


At the high end, direct COVID-19 spending represents about 8.5% of the bill’s $1.9 trillion cost.





See the sources for this fact-check




Republicans’ primary objection to the COVID-19 and economic stimulus bill making its way through Congress is that it spends relatively little on the disease itself.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the $1.9 trillion package known as the American Rescue Plan was loaded with ""pet projects"" that had nothing to do with the pandemic or economic recovery.
""All kinds of liberal wish list items that would do nothing to help American families put COVID behind them,"" McConnell said Feb. 24. ""Just about 1% of the money is for vaccines.""
McConnell’s focus on 1% for vaccines caught our attention.
His staff said he drew on the words of the Democrats themselves when they unveiled a key section of the sweeping bill.
The chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., highlighted a handful of items in the package in a news release, including $14 billion for vaccines, $46 billion for testing, contact tracing, and mitigation, and $25 billion to reduce health disparities across the country.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget use the $14 billion figure.
However, there are different ways to add up the numbers.
The same Democratic-controlled committee that provided the $14 billion figure came out a few days later with a factsheet that uses an amount of $20 billion. And they note there’s an additional $5 billion for advanced vaccine development.
The different totals depend on what counts as vaccine spending. The lower figure in the first Democratic press release included only work at the CDC, the FDA, and ensuring a reliable supply chain to produce and administer the vaccine.
The higher Democratic tally included other activities, such as sequencing the genome of virus variants and paying for health care workers to administer the vaccine.
How much does this matter?

In percentage terms, not that much. Even a total of $25 billion still amounts to just over 1% of the bill’s estimated price tag. That’s because the overall package includes big ticket items such as $422 billion in stimulus checks to individuals, $350 billion for state and local governments, and $242 billion for expanded unemployment benefits.
But in terms of dollars, there’s a big difference between $14 billion and $20 billion or $25 billion.
The point is, it’s possible to use percentages to make an amount appear small, and actual dollars to make the same amount look substantial.
Context helps
The most heated debate in Congress centers on how the American Rescue Plan deals with the economic damage of the pandemic.
McConnell’s claim has more to do with the money aimed most directly at the virus and pandemic itself. In that vein, focussing strictly on vaccines leaves out a lot of the picture. 
The biggest overlooked piece is $46 billion for testing and other surveillance work. 
That work is as important as any other, said Amesh Adalja at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Better surveillance helps target vaccine distribution to certain states or communities, and is part of spotting virus mutations to improve the next generation of vaccines.
""There is a continuum and integration between all response activities,"" Adajla said. ""Those include testing, tracing, isolating and vaccinating.""
Vaccines have to make their way into people’s arms, and the legislation funds several programs to support that work, including $7.6 billion to hire 100,000 community health workers.
We found different ways to add up all the spending tied directly to COVID-19. On the low end, the total is about $100 billion. On the high end, the White House says it is $160 billion, which adds items such as $10 billion in medical supplies, $24 billion in child care for health care and other essential workers, and literally dozens of smaller amounts.
Depending on which line items you include, the legislation would spend anywhere from 4.5% to 8.5% of the total cost directly on the pandemic’s health aspects.
Our ruling
McConnell said that in the American Rescue Plan, ""just about 1% of the money is for vaccines."" Based on Democratic figures of either $14 billion or $20 billion for vaccines, and a $1.9 trillion overall price tag, the math is about right.
The American Rescue Plan spends much more on the financial damage caused by the virus than on its health aspects alone, and McConnell picked a way to minimize the health-related spending. The statistic omits a much greater amount of spending on overall efforts to contain the pandemic. That ranges from about $100 billion to $160 billion, or between 5% and 8% of the bill’s total cost.

That figure tracks with a study from a left-leaning think tank that uses various numbers provided by Forbes regarding the net worth of billionaires.


The timeframe for the study follows closely – but not exactly – with the declaration of the coronavirus as a pandemic.


But the impact from COVID-19 on the stock market, for instance, began earlier. So the tally may distort the picture a bit, by starting at an economic low point.





See the sources for this fact-check




When Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden visited Manitowoc on Sept. 21, his stop – at the Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry – had a blue-collar bent.
So did his message.
""President talks all the time about how great the economy is,"" Biden told a group of workers.
But, he noted, many places and sectors are not doing well amid the economic fallout of COVID-19, unemployment remains high and many Americans are at risk of losing their homes. Then he drew a sharp contrast: 
""Now, the billionaires in this country are seeing their wealth increase by $800 billion,"" Biden said: ""Let me explain that again: all the billionaires in America, during the pandemic, their net worth combined, according to studies, have increased by $800 billion."" 
Is Biden right?
The report and methodology
When asked for backup on the claim, a representative for Biden’s campaign pointed to an update of a report by the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning Washington D.C. think tank. 
The report, ""Billionaire Bonanza 2020,"" was done by the institute in partnership with Americans for Tax Fairness. The latter falls under the non-profit New Venture Fund, which is managed by a for-profit company, Arabella Advisors, that consults on philanthropy. 
They used numbers from two features by Forbes.
The first, is Forbes’ annual list of billionaires, ""The Richest in 2020,"" which was published April 7. That list was compiled based on stock prices and exchange rates on March 18. That would be one week after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. (Trump declared a national emergency on March 13.)
The second is Forbes’ ""The World’s Real-Time Billionaires,"" an online list that tracks the net worth of billionaires using that day’s stock prices and exchange rates.
For its analysis, the group compared the two, and linked to a spreadsheet that showed the change in the billionaires’ net worth between March 18 and Sept. 15 was $845.1 billion.

To be sure, not all billionaires gained during the time period, and not all billionaires listed had net worth numbers associated with them.
But the overall change tracks well with what Biden said.
That said, there is a wrinkle to discuss.
The data used by the think tank roughly covers the period from when the coronavirus was formally declared a pandemic.
But by that point, the coronavirus had been spreading around the globe for several months -- and already had an effect on stock prices and wealth. While there is no measuring stick available to begin the tally from January, it’s safe to say that picture would be somewhat different.
The Institute for Policy Studies did not respond to email requests for comment from PolitiFact Wisconsin.
But Timothy Smeeding, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of public affairs, noted there was some decline in the stock market prior to that low point at the end of March. Since then, it has overall been improving. 
So, the study only looks at gains during the bounceback from a very low point in the market. That may serve to exaggerate the growth during the pandemic at least to some degree.
Our ruling
Citing a study, Biden claimed that billionaires in America saw their net worth grow by $800 billion during the pandemic.
That number tracks with what the study found. And, while the dates in the study do not match up perfectly with when the coronavirus was declared a pandemic, they are close. 
That said, the effects of COVID-19 on things such as the stock market were being felt before the pandemic declaration, so the timetable being used may exaggerate the growth a bit because it uses a low starting point.

Jon Rosenthal","Examining how science determines COVID-19's 'herd immunity threshold'




The strategy to achieve herd immunity within a population to reverse the spread of COVID-19 has been a matter of intense debate over the course of the pandemic.  
One component of this debate involves the herd immunity threshold, or the percentage of a population that must be immunized from a disease, be it through infections or vaccinations, for the spread to abate. The more infectious a contagion, the higher its threshold. 
For instance, measles, a highly infectious disease that is at least three times as contagious as COVID-19, requires a herd immunity threshold level of around 94%, meaning that 94% of a population will need to be immune to measles before its transmission rate declines. 
But pinning down a concrete herd immunity threshold level for COVID-19 has so far been theoretical guesswork. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say that the herd immunity threshold for any virus lies between 50% and 90%. Researchers in the United Kingdom and Brazil hypothesized during the early part of the pandemic that threshold could be as low as 6% to 21%, although their study has since been found to have critical errors. 
Earlier this month, state Rep. Jon Rosenthal, D-Cypress, who has lost a family member and friend to COVID-19, took to Twitter to dispel common myths and ""rampant misinformation"" about the virus and its vaccines, which are now slowly being distributed throughout Texas. In his tweet thread, Rosenthal echoed a number that has commonly been repeated as COVID-19's herd immunity threshold. 
""To defeat this pandemic AND recover our economy, the safest and most effective way is for the population to be immunized,"" he tweeted Tuesday. ""The way to reach ‘herd immunity’ is for >70% of the population to get vaccinated."" 
Immunity can be reached one of two ways: through natural infections, which create antibodies in people who have recovered from a disease that can potentially ward off future infection (an estimated 20% of the global population has been infected naturally); or through vaccination, a safer way to immunity because it does not cause illness. 
The herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 has been somewhat of a moving target throughout the pandemic as researchers grapple with understanding the virus. Let’s review what current thinking is on the virus’ threshold. 
Determining the herd immunity threshold 
There are two ways health experts think about a virus’ infection rate, mathematically represented as the R value. First, there’s the more theoretical R value known as the basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced ""R naught""). This term indicates the average number of times one infected person will transmit the virus to another person. For example, measles has an R0 value between 12 and 18, meaning that one person infected with measles will, on average, spread the virus to another 12 to 18 people before they either die or recover. R0 is a theoretical figure that assumes everyone in a population is without immunity and susceptible to infection. 
Then there is the more practical version of the R value — the effective reproduction rate, represented as Rt. The effective reproduction rate considers the fact that some people within a population will be immune to a disease, or that certain interventions have been put in place to slow spread, like social distancing or mask-wearing. The Rt value is more of a real-time representation of what a virus’ infection rate is and it decreases as a greater share of the population is immunized or as more interventions are put in place.  
The exact R value for COVID-19, however, has not been concretely determined. According to Spencer Fox, associate director of the COVID-19 modeling consortium at the University of Texas, data during the early period of the pandemic suggested that the R0 rate was 2.5. Now it is believed to be within the 4 to 6 range. The Rt value, while much harder to determine, is estimated to be around 1.05 in the U.S. thanks to preventative measures and natural immunities.  
""There's kind of been this shifting conversation about what is the actual basic reproduction number of the virus,"" Fox said. ""We try and extrapolate from other populations, but every population will have a slightly different number.""

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







Typically, it is the R0 figure that is used in determining a virus’ herd immunity threshold because the goal is to return to a state of normalcy where interventions are no longer necessary. The threshold is calculated by plugging the R0 value into a formula: [1-(1÷R0)]*100 = threshold %. 
With an R0 value of 2.5, the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 would be 60%. With an R0 value of 6, the threshold would be 83%. 
But according to Dr. David Dowdy, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, these numbers are highly theoretical.  
The herd immunity threshold is ""something that’s easy for the public to understand, but not really reflective of reality,"" Dowdy said. ""The reality is that it’s a spectrum, but people like to see things in black and white and they like to have specific numbers to latch onto."" 
""At some point we will build up enough immunity. Whether it be through people getting the disease or through people getting the vaccine, that transmission (rate) will start to go down,"" he said. ""It's not like there's a magic number that we have to hit and if we don't hit it we'll forever have this pandemic with us. The more people we can get vaccinated the fewer people get sick and die."" 
According to Fox, publicizing a herd immunity threshold level, while not accurately reflective of reality, does have usefulness. 
""Right now, the main use of providing a high number is to motivate people to actually get the vaccine, because in my mind we should try and vaccinate as many people as possible,"" Fox said. 
The 70% threshold cited by Rosenthal and others is, to Fox, ""in the ballpark.""  
""It could be possibly as low as 50% and as high as 80%, so 70% is kind of in the middle. I would shoot higher. I wouldn't have this expectation that the disease goes away at this point,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
On Jan. 5, Rosenthal published a tweet saying that the way to reach herd immunity is for at least 70% of the population to get vaccinated. In an email, Rosenthal said his information came from a Reuters article that cited the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimating a 67% herd immunity threshold and the World Health Organization estimating a 65% to 70% threshold. 
""There are apparently too many unknowns to be certain, but the 70% figure lines up with some common estimates,"" Rosenthal said. 
The herd immunity threshold is calculated by using a disease’s rate of transmission. Although scientists have not agreed upon a definite rate, and even though these rates are highly theoretical, estimates show that the thresholds lies somewhere between 60% and 83%.

If Your Time is short





Hospitalizations and deaths among children are higher for the seasonal flu than they are for COVID-19


The CDC states that the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19, though kids with underlying medical conditions will be at greater risk for both 


But experts caution that we might not yet see the whole picture of how dangerous the coronavirus is for kids because schools largely shut down when it started to spread, shielding them from that potential place of exposure. 





See the sources for this fact-check




As schools across the country open for the uncertain, unprecedented school year to come, opinions are split on how to do so safely. 
Some districts have opted for completely virtual learning. Others will try a mix of both online and in-person classes, or will send younger children to school while older kids stay home, or will phase students back to the classroom gradually. 
Others still are calling for schools to reopen completely for those who feel well enough to teach and attend, and who aren’t especially vulnerable to COVID-19.  
One such voice is U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who in an Aug. 13, 2020 radio interview with Milwaukee talk show host Steve Scaffidi on WTMJ-AM discussed why he believes students need to return to school in person this fall. 
For younger people, Johnson asserted, ""seasonal flu is actually, in many cases, a deadlier virus if they contract that."" 
Is Johnson correct that COVID-19 is less deadly for children than the flu? 
Let’s dig in. 
COVID was less harsh on kids than the flu, this year’s stats show
To back up his claim, Johnson’s office sent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on flu and COVID-19 deaths among Americans under age 18.
During the 2018-19 flu season, the CDC reported approximately 480 flu deaths among children ages 0-17, about 30% of whom had a lab-confirmed case of influenza.
Comparably, 90 American youth have died from coronavirus complications from the beginning of the pandemic through mid-August, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
More than 46,000 children were hospitalized for flu in that 2018-19 period. The hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children. For COVID-19, that hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children ages 5 to 17, the CDC says.
In a report detailing the differences between COVID-19 and the flu, the CDC states that ""the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







And data from Wisconsin echoes that sentiment. Since the pandemic began, no children have died from COVID-19 complications, according to state Department of Health Services death data, and 147 people ages 0-19 have been hospitalized. In contrast, three pediatric flu deaths occurred during this year’s flu season, DHS data show, and 605 kids ages 17 and under have been hospitalized. 
What those statistics might not account for  
The data show there have been fewer childhood deaths from COVID-19 so far this year than from the seasonal flu. 
The hold-up, of course, lies in nuance, said Dr. Jon Temte, associate dean for public health and community engagement within UW-Madison’s School of Medicine and Public Health. 
""U.S. schools have been out (and) mostly closed since March, thus extremely limiting cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Conversely, we rarely close schools for influenza, thus allowing an attack rate of 30-40% in school-aged children,"" Temte wrote in an Aug. 27, 2020 email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. 
That is, the flu has been able to spread through children more commonly than COVID-19, creating more cases, more complications and more deaths. 
Other experts agree. Dr. Chad Vercio, chair of pediatrics at Riverside University Health System in California, said children’s risk from the coronavirus depends on how widespread the virus is in any given area, and that ""it is unknown"" if COVID hospitalization rates would rise once schools reopen.
And though the early data suggests that COVID-19 is not as bad for children as the flu, it’s just that: Early. 
Dr. Vidya Mony, an infectious disease expert with Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, Calif., said there isn’t enough data yet to say indisputably that COVID risks are lower for kids.
Our ruling 
Johnson claimed that in many cases, the seasonal flu was a deadlier virus for youth than COVID-19. 
The numbers show that this year, that was the case. More children died from flu complications than from COVID-19, and were hospitalized at higher rates for the flu. 
But experts caution that we don’t have enough data to paint the full picture so early in the game, and that schools shutting down in early spring may have driven down coronavirus case rates in children — meaning we can’t be sure exactly how the virus will move through young people when more of them are potentially getting exposed.

Stefan Mychajliw","Is Erie County’s health commissioner paid roughly the same as Anthony Fauci?




If Your Time is short





Dr. Gale Burstein’s compensation, when factoring in fringe benefits, reached $532,418 in 2020 due to a special overtime rule enacted during the coronavirus pandemic.


Burstein’s combination of salary, benefits, and overtime in 2020 exceeded the easily classifiable compensation for Pence, Fauci and Gov. Cuomo.


However, Cuomo and Pence receive housing, transportation, and security benefits that are large but hard to quantify, and if these benefits are added into the calculation, they likely exceed what Burstein received.

How well-paid is Dr. Gale Burstein, the health commissioner of Erie County, N.Y.? According to Erie County Comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, Burstein rivals Dr. Anthony Fauci, the long-tenured federal official who is playing a key role combating the coronavirus.
In 2020, Burstein’s compensation, when factoring in fringe benefits, reached $532,418, based on a new report produced by Mychajliw’s office.
""I think a lot of people are going to be very angry that the health commissioner makes more than the governor, the vice president of the United States, and has a salary that is comparable to Dr. Anthony Fauci,"" Mychajliw said, according to the Buffalo News.
Could a county-wide official really be out-earning such lofty officials? We took a closer look.
Calculating Burstein’s income
Government administrators generally do not receive overtime pay. In a normal, pandemic-free year, Burstein would have made $202,312 in base salary, and a total of $304,985 when benefits are included.
However, starting in 2020, Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz allowed all non-union, managerial, confidential employees to accept overtime pay for their work related to the coronavirus, the Buffalo News reported.
The report found that during 2020, Burstein collected $183,414 for 1,266 hours of overtime work and $44,019 in fringe benefits on this overtime, not including health insurance. This made her the largest single recipient of taxpayer-funded overtime in Erie County, which includes Buffalo.
In a statement, Erie County executive Mark C. Poloncarz verified Burstein’s earnings and added that Burstein is ""performing two full-time jobs.""
Mychajliw said that including Burstein’s overtime pay, her 2020 salary places her among the highest paid officials not just in the state but the federal government as well.
How does her salary compare?
Jessica O’Neil, Mychajliw’s associate deputy comptroller and chief of staff, directed PolitiFact reporters to the Erie County budget and several articles showing the salary of top government officials.
For the governor of New York, O’Neil cited an article in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle that said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's annual salary is set to rise to $250,000 in 2021. However, Cuomo chose to defer his scheduled $25,000 pay raise and asked other statewide officials to do the same, citing economic hardships.

Cuomo had been set to see his annual salary increase from $225,000 to $250,000 on Jan. 1 as part of a three-year pay schedule approved by state lawmakers in 2019. This deferral will ultimately mean Cuomo will make the same salary —  $225,000 — in 2021 as he did in 2020.
Former Vice President Mike Pence earned $230,700 in 2019, and that was set to increase to $235,100 in 2020 as a result of the expiration of a pay freeze.
Finally, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to the president, made $417,608 in wages 2019, which is the latest year in which federal salaries were available via the Freedom of Information Act.
So Burstein’s total salary plus overtime in 2020 was $385,726, which easily beats the number for Cuomo and Pence. Once benefits are added in, her total compensation package of $532,418 beats Fauci as well.
The caveat is that Pence and Cuomo, and possibly Fauci, receive perks that are difficult to value, and which may leave Burstein’s compensation in the dust.
The vice president lived rent-free in a 9,150-square-foot Victorian mansion at Number One Observatory Circle, plus access to Air Force Two, a large security detail, and free food prepared by the executive chef and executive pastry chef at the White House, among several other benefits.
Meanwhile, Cuomo gets the benefit of living arrangements at the New York State Executive Mansion and transportation via taxpayer funded planes and helicopters.
Finally, it’s worth noting that Burstein’s income will decrease when and if the special pandemic compensation rules are rolled back.
Our ruling
Mychajliw said, ""I think a lot of people are going to be very angry that the health commissioner makes more than the governor, the vice president of the United States, and has a salary that is comparable to Dr. Anthony Fauci.""
Burstein is benefitting from a rule that allows her to collect overtime, and she’s working more hours because of the pandemic. So Burstein’s salary and overtime alone exceeded the easily classifiable compensation for Cuomo and Pence, and when benefits are added in, she beats Fauci as well.
However, Cuomo and Pence receive housing, transportation, and security benefits that are large but hard to quantify, and if these benefits are added into the calculation, they likely exceed what Burstein received.

Lloyd Doggett","Exploring the spike in coronavirus cases in one Central Texas county




If Your Time is short




Doggett's claim left out an important detail: the statistic he highlighted is about the growth in the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases. The increase in the 7-day average and the actual count of new cases is significantly higher. 




See the sources for this fact-check





Coronavirus infections are on the rise in Texas, with some areas experiencing a more dramatic increase than others.
In Central Texas, Austin and its surrounding counties have reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations. Hays County, which sits to the south of Austin, has been hit particularly hard.
On June 19, the county reported more active cases than Austin’s Travis County — a remarkable feat considering that Travis County’s population is five times that of Hays County.
U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat whose district includes parts of both counties, shared two tweets about the Austin area, including one highlighting the impact of the virus in Hays County.
""Hays County is one of the only places in Texas with more trouble: an incredible 845% increase in cases since June 7,"" he wrote.
There’s no question Hays County has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, but is Doggett’s figure accurate? 
Hays County increase tied to activities
In response to a question from PolitiFact Texas, Hays County spokeswoman Kim Hilsenbeck shared a press release outlining the impact of the coronavirus in the county since the onset of the pandemic.
During April and early May — when local and statewide orders to stay at home were in place — the number of new daily cases in the county ranged from zero to ten.
In late April, Gov. Greg Abbott initiated the first phase of a plan to reopen the state’s economy and allowed the statewide stay-at-home order to expire. He also allowed restaurants, retail stores, malls and movie theaters to reopen at limited capacity.
In subsequent phases, Abbott allowed barbershops and salons to reopen with limited capacity and other restrictions. He also allowed rivers, parks and other natural areas to reopen. 
County health officials said they believe the gradual reopening of businesses might have contributed to an increase in COVID-19 cases. 
""Through contact tracing, our health department staff were able to see the rapid increase in COVID-19 totals seemed to coincide with activities such as working at or going to restaurants and bars, activities such as floating the river, and attending large public gatherings,"" the release reads. 
Hilsenbeck also highlighted Mothers Day (May 10), Memorial Day (May 25) and protests against racism and police brutality as significant events in May.
By the end of May and early June, the number of new cases in the county started to rise. On May 27 there were 18 new cases. On June 8, there were 43 new cases. 
More recently, the number of new daily cases in Hays County has ranged from 100 to 200.

In April and May, the majority of new cases in the county were primarily in Kyle among people older than 30 who were Hispanic. 
But since early June, the group experiencing the largest increase in new COVID-19 cases is 20 to 29-year-olds in San Marcos. The number of people who identified as Hispanic has decreased.
""While not all 20-29-year-olds are college students, San Marcos has a large student population because of Texas State University, many of whom are now back in town following a period of virtual learning throughout the spring,"" the release reads.
Examining data on new cases
Doggett spokeswoman Kate Stotesbery said the figure he shared came from a graph published by an Austin-area television station. 
The graph shows the number of new coronavirus cases that have been reported each day in Hays County since April, plus a line showing the 14-day average of daily new cases.
An arrow pointing upwards is overlaid on the graphic, with text on top that reads: ""845% 14-day average since June 7.""
But Doggett’s remark on Twitter is missing that detail — that there has been an 845% increase in the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases in the county since June 7. The increase in the actual number of cases is much higher.
On June 7, the cumulative number of cases in the county was 385 and the number of new daily cases had been fluctuating. There were 24 new cases on June 2, 14 new cases on June 4 and zero new cases on June 7.
By June 21, the cumulative count of cases in Hays County was 1,608, with 57 new cases reported that day.
Looking at the 14-day average of new cases, it was 8 on June 7 and 87 on June 21.
But the 7-day average is a more commonly used measurement by government agencies and news outlets to assess changes in the number of new cases in the area. The change in that figure during this period is substantially higher.
Using weekly averages instead of daily tallies offers a more accurate picture of change over time, as it reduces the impact of daily spikes.
From June 7 to June 21, Hays County experienced a roughly 1,569% increase in the 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases — from 8 cases on June 7 to 134 on June 21.
Our ruling
Doggett said that Hays County had experienced ""an incredible 845% increase in cases since June 7.""
Doggett was actually speaking about an increase in the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases — a less common measurement of the increase in COVID-19 cases in an area — but his figure is accurate.

Donald Trump","Donald Trump accurate that deaths from coronavirus are falling




If Your Time is short



• Deaths from the coronavirus have fallen consistently since their peak in late April, and have continued to fall in June even as the number of cases has risen. 
• Experts say deaths lag behind the number of cases. So the trend may reverse. 



See the sources for this fact-check




With an increasing number of coronavirus cases across the country, President Donald Trump pointed to a metric that reflects more favorably on his administration’s pandemic response.
On June 23, Trump tweeted, ""Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!!""
Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!! https://t.co/bKFmgOLEGZ— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 23, 2020 
His argument that tests are the only reason for rising cases is not accurate. But on the trend for mortality, Trump has a point.
Epidemiologists told PolitiFact that due to wide variations in testing patterns, the data doesn’t offer a clear look at how likely someone is to die from the virus if they are infected with it. Gaps in testing leave too many undiagnosed cases to reliably determine a person’s likelihood of dying from the coronavirus, much less whether the likelihood of dying has risen or fallen over time.
Instead, researchers say, the most solid metric for assessing Trump’s statement is the number of new coronavirus deaths reported per day.
The number of daily deaths from coronavirus has been falling consistently since peaking in late April. In fact, even as infections have risen since early June, deaths have not. (The orange line in the following chart shows the seven-day rolling average of coronavirus deaths, which smooths out data variations.)

 
At the peak in late April, more than 2,000 were dying from coronavirus on a typical day. In late June, it’s less than 600. That’s still a large number of deaths every day. All told, roughly 115,000 have died from COVID-19 to date.
The White House told PolitiFact that the per-capita number of deaths in the United States is also lower than it is in several advanced industrialized countries in Europe that were hard hit by the virus. According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of coronavirus deaths per 100,000 population is about 37 for the United States, compared with 65 in the United Kingdom, 61 in Spain, and 57 in Italy.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







But other European countries have lower death rates for COVID-19 than the United States does, including the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark. 
So why are deaths falling? There may be several reasons, and for now, they’re somewhat speculative.
One possibility is that the initial wave of infections disproportionately reached more patients with weaker immune systems, including those in nursing homes, or more vulnerable Americans who hadn’t yet taken up effective social distancing. By contrast, more recent waves of infections may be reaching younger and healthier people who are better able to survive an infection.
Another possibility is that we’re ""getting better at treatment and keeping people alive,"" said Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University’s College of Public Health.
Still, epidemiologists caution that deaths are a lagging indicator. The disease often takes two to three weeks to run its course, meaning that one day’s crop of new infections tends to drive the deaths that occur two to three weeks later.
""We might not expect an increase in the death rate until approximately 21 days from when we started to see an increase in cases,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.
So far, the age breakdown for deaths has been fairly consistent — people older than 65 accounted for 81% of coronavirus deaths at the mortality peak in mid-April, and that age group still accounted for 82% of in mid-July, a time when the total number of deaths had fallen significantly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Since we’re about two weeks into the national rise in infections, scientists will be watching to see if deaths start increasing a week from now.
Our ruling
Trump said that mortality from coronavirus is ""way down.""
This is one of the few coronavirus measurements that Trump can point to with optimism. The number of deaths has remained substantial, at a bit below 600 per day by mid-to-late June, but that’s more than two-thirds lower than the peak of about 2,000 daily deaths in late April. The number of coronavirus deaths per day has continued to fall in June even as the number of cases has risen.

• West Virginia has seen an overdose spike during the pandemic.
• For the period from April through June, responses by emergency medical services for suspected overdoses rose 33% compared to the same period a year earlier. But for May and June alone, the number rose 47%, which is close to the 50% Miller cited.



See the sources for this fact-check




Has the coronavirus pandemic also sent drug overdoses soaring? That’s what Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said in a July 30 tweet.
Miller tweeted, ""In West Virginia alone, overdoses have increased by 50% during the #COVID-19 pandemic. We must stop the illegal drug flow across our Southern Border. That’s why I added an amendment to 2021 government funding to #BuildTheWall. Sadly, House Democrats voted this down.""
We’ve previously rated Mostly True the statement by fellow West Virginia Republican Rep. David McKinney that ""$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs."" We’ve also rated True the statement that West Virginia has the highest overdose rate of any state.
In this article, we’ll focus on Miller’s assertion that the pandemic and the economic dislocation that has followed have driven an increasing number of overdoses in West Virginia.
We found evidence in two West Virginia media reports published not long before Miller’s tweet that supports the idea that the state has seen a rise in overdoses since the pandemic.
In late June, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported on increases in overdoses. West Virginia Public Broadcasting did so in early July. (Both outlets are PolitiFact West Virginia partners.)
Both news reports cited data from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources showing that emergency responses for suspected overdoses had increased by close to 50%. At the time of those reports, the agency had recorded 923 emergency responses for May 2020, compared with 650 in May 2019. That was a 42% increase.
The article also reported a more than fivefold increase for June in average weekly overdoses that are reversed by naloxone, a medication used to rapidly reverse opioid overdoses. Overdoses reversed by naloxone averaged 16 per week in June 2020, compared with norms of three per week and 12 per month, according to the article. 
Miller’s office referenced the articles when we inquired, but because the articles had appeared several weeks before Miller’s tweet, we looked for state Health Department data that was available closer to the date of her statement. The data for each month are updated on the 15th day of the following month, Allison Adler, the department’s director of communications, told PolitiFact, but the updates could include some earlier months.

Counting all the updates made as of Aug. 15, the number of overdoses in April 2020 held steady compared with the previous year, but the numbers did spike in May and June. Emergency response for suspected overdoses increased by 64% in May and 30% in June. 
So for the three months combined, the number increased by 33% from a year earlier, but during May and June alone, the numbers rose by 47%, which is close to Miller’s figure. July numbers were on par with those in 2019, but Miller wouldn’t have known about that data point when she sent her tweet.

 
The department also offers another metric: emergency room visits related to overdoses. These increased by 12% in May and June compared to the year prior. (It would later rise by 28% in July.)
This pattern has been echoed elsewhere in the United States. 
The New York Times has reported that drug overdose deaths rose to record numbers in 2019, and are already 13% higher than average in 2020, according to mortality data from local and state governments covering 40% of the U.S. population. The Association of American Medical Colleges also reported that suspected drug overdoses rose 18% from mid-March through May, which would be consistent with the notion that the pandemic is pushing overdoses higher.

Miller said, ""In West Virginia alone, overdoses have increased by 50% during the #COVID-19 pandemic.""

Not all local COVID-19 victims are being automatically buried there. The site has been used by the city since the 19th century as a public cemetery for unclaimed people and those whose families can’t afford private burials.

Harrowing images of wooden caskets being lowered into mass graves in New York City circulated on social media as the city responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The images and related video footage are accurate depictions of recent burials on Hart Island in the Long Island Sound. That said, there have been some misconceptions about the mass graves.
Posts about the grave site were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
First, mass burials didn’t begin on Hart Island during the COVID-19 pandemic. The city has used the location as a public cemetery for over 150 years, burying unclaimed people and those whose loved ones can’t afford private burials. 
Second, not all locals who die from COVID-19 are being buried there, as some posts have suggested. The site is still designated for deceased people with no known next of kin.
But as the city struggles with the mounting death toll amid the pandemic, burials on the island have dramatically increased in recent weeks.

There are usually about 25 burials on the island each week, the New York mayor’s press secretary Freddie Goldstein told CNN. But that number has climbed to nearly 25 each day.
The island’s interment operation is managed by the city’s Department of Correction, and inmates usually assist in the burials. But that has changed since the pandemic.
DOC spokesperson Jason Kersten has said that city inmates are not currently involved with the burials: ""For social distancing and safety reasons, city-sentenced people in custody are not assisting in burials for the duration of the pandemic. Contracted laborers are performing this important work under DOC supervision,"" according to a report by the Gothamist.
Bodies are ordinarily held at the city’s morgues anywhere from 30 to 60 days, Goldstein said. But to make room for the influx of deceased individuals during the pandemic, the city’s medical examiner’s office announced a new policy of holding unclaimed bodies for only up to 15 days before they are transferred to the island.
Our ruling
New York City’s Hart Island has been used as a public cemetery for unclaimed bodies since the 1800s, but the city’s staggering death toll amid the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the number of burials on the island.

As President Donald Trump’s negotiators were working with congressional leaders to assemble a coronavirus economic relief package, the president’s re-election campaign didn’t shy away from blasting one key Democratic leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
On March 24, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale shared a video focused on the coronavirus bill Pelosi had released the day before. It named a half-dozen provisions in the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act that the Trump campaign considered outside the scope of the current crisis.
On screen, the ad says:
""Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats clog their coronavirus relief bill with leftist wishlist. Democrat bill includes: tax credits for solar and wind energy … emissions standards and carbon offset requirements for airlines … policing racial makeup of corporate boards … retirement plans for community newspaper employees … $300 million for PBS … climate change studies for civil aviation and aerospace industries. Democrats don’t care about your health or the economy. They only care about politics""
Democratic officials acknowledge that most of those provisions are in the bill, which at the time the ad was launched was taking a back seat to negotiations over a Senate bill. However, one of the provisions cited by the Trump campaign’s ad is not in the bill.

A still from a Trump campaign ad targeting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's coronavirus relief bill.
The airline provisions: carbon offsets, corporate board diversity, climate change study
Pelosi’s bill seeks to shape the behavior of any airlines that accept federal assistance to the benefit of their workers, customers and the environment.

Carbon offsets are addressed in section 704 of the bill. Corporate board diversity, in the form of retrospective reporting requirements, is part of section 407, while the climate change study is in section 707.
A statement provided by the Democratic leadership said that ""the extreme impacts that COVID-19 has had on corporate operations, the workforce, the lack of adequate contingency plans designed to protect worker interests and needs, and the impact this has had on the national economy highlights the need to have worker interests represented on corporate boards.""
Retirement plans for community newspapers
This language, in section 404, is largely drawn from H.R. 1916, a bill that has been introduced but not advanced. The bill would change rules for community newspapers’ defined-benefit pension plans.
The Democratic leadership says this is part of an overall pension package to help cash flow for companies.
$300 million for PBS
This would be a supplemental appropriation for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and which is facing shortfalls due to the coronavirus, the Democratic leadership says.
Tax credits for solar and wind energy
This is the one provision cited by the ad that is not actually in the House bill, despite pressure from the industry to include it.

Donald Trump","Trump’s COVID program for uninsured people: It exists, but falls short




If Your Time is short




President Donald Trump’s executive order said his administration created a program to provide uninsured people with access to COVID-19 testing and treatment, tapping into funding from economic relief packages to reimburse health care providers for such care.

 
How these funds provide “coverage access” to care is hard to determine. Experts say a more comprehensive solution would have been preferred.

 
Medical providers welcome the reimbursement, but hospitals say limits in the program mean a portion of uninsured patients are ineligible.




See the sources for this fact-check




In a wide-ranging executive order, President Donald Trump this month outlined some of the efforts he has made to affect health care since taking office.
One involved uninsured people and the current pandemic. The administration, Trump said, set up a program to provide them ""access to necessary COVID-19-related testing and treatment.""
Did it?
We asked the White House for more specifics about the program Trump mentioned but did not get a reply.
Nonetheless, experts said he is likely referring to reimbursement assistance to help pay the COVID testing and treatment costs of uninsured patients available through the Provider Relief Fund.
This fund was established by Congress in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act to bolster eligible health care providers for lost revenue or expenses related to the pandemic.
The Trump administration said this spring it would tap into the fund to reimburse providers who test and treat uninsured COVID patients; hence, the executive order’s reference to ""coverage access."" Here’s how it works: The assistance doesn’t go directly to patients. Instead, health care providers can apply for reimbursement of costs associated with testing or treating uninsured people for COVID-19. Patients must be uninsured and their primary diagnosis must be COVID-19. The program does not check immigration status in determining eligibility.
Our experts acknowledged that the fund overall has helped providers by making money available, especially important since many physicians, hospitals and other health care facilities are struggling with reduced income as elective surgeries and visits have nose-dived during the pandemic. The relief fund pays providers at standard Medicare rates for testing or treating uninsured COVID patients.
Still, many patients, and some providers, don’t know about the funding to reimburse for uninsured costs. And even providers who are aware of it don’t necessarily know how to use it. Hospitals and other providers are not required to publicize it. Additionally, eligibility restrictions can make it hard for some patients to qualify to have their bills paid.
""It’s absolutely not broad protection or a guarantee of coverage,"" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow with KFF. ""People are uninsured. They remain uninsured. If they don’t know how to ask for this or the provider can’t figure out how to use it, [their bills] are uncollectable.""
What exactly is ‘coverage access’?
Even before the pandemic, uninsured patients had a hard time finding medical care, often delaying needed medical services until a crisis sent them to the hospital. Federal law ensures that no one needing emergency care be turned away and must be treated until stabilized.
The relief fund program came amid calls from health insurers, Democrats and others for the Trump administration to reopen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act through the federal marketplace, which operates in 38 states.
Usually, the insurance sign-up period occurs each November. When the virus began causing concern in the U.S. in the spring, some of the 12 states (and the District of Columbia) that run their own marketplaces moved to reopen because of the pandemic, so uninsured residents could sign up.
But the Trump administration decided not to reopen the federal marketplace. Uninsured people who want to enroll either have to wait to sign up starting in November for coverage next year or see if they qualify for a special enrollment because they have experienced one of several ""qualifying life events."" One such event is job loss that ends health coverage.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







That potentially left hospitals and other medical providers holding the bag for the uninsured who fall sick with COVID.
Enter the relief fund.
The Health Resources and Services Administration said the fund so far has handed out a little more than $1 billion for uninsured patient reimbursement, a substantial amount but well short of publicized estimates of what it will ultimately cost hospitals and medical providers to test and treat uninsured COVID patients.
""We are appreciative"" that Congress and the administration ""did provide some coverage for the uninsured,"" said Molly Smith, vice president for coverage and state issues at the American Hospital Association. ""But we don’t think it’s the best approach for covering the uninsured."" Hospitals would have preferred something that ""would have expanded comprehensive coverage.""
Parts of the program work well, she said, but ""there are some pretty substantial flaws.""
Why ‘access’ becomes a slippery term
When it comes to program eligibility, two main criteria present hurdles for patients: fitting the definition of ""uninsured"" and receiving a primary diagnosis of COVID-19.
Failing either test could make a patient ineligible. In that case, the hospital or medical provider can either seek payment from the patient — or eat the cost.
To qualify for coverage, the patient cannot have any kind of health insurance coverage, according to guidelines published online by HRSA.
Even having very limited coverage — such as a program in Medicaid that covers only family planning services such as birth control — would disqualify a patient, said Smith. Another disqualification would be the purchase of one of the limited coverage plans touted by the administration that don’t cover all the same services an ACA plan would include.
The second hurdle: COVID-19 must be the primary diagnosis.
""If someone with a heart attack comes in and it turns out COVID is also involved — or could have even been the trigger,"" the provider might not be eligible for reimbursement, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at Georgetown University.
Another common example, Smith said, is a patient with COVID-19 who develops sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection. Under long-standing coding and billing rules, sepsis would be the primary diagnosis, making any coronavirus-related patient care ineligible under the provider relief program.
Our ruling
The Trump administration did implement a program to reimburse medical providers for testing and treatment of some uninsured patients, tapping into funding allocated by Congress.
Whether — and to what extent — the measure improved ""coverage access"" to care is hard to determine. The fund has paid out more than $1 billion so far.
The administration chose this route, which experts said was an incomplete fix, over following some states’ lead in allowing a special enrollment period on the federal marketplace, which would have enabled people without health insurance to buy more comprehensive coverage. Meanwhile, the program has not been publicized and has confusing eligibility rules — both of which have led to speculation that it is not being used as widely as possible.
The administration’s program appears to provide narrow financial assistance for COVID-related health care costs. But patients who fall through the cracks may find themselves facing substantial bills.

In most of Florida, the beaches have reopened in recent weeks after shutdowns.


More people back on the beaches has led to more litter at Cocoa Beach.

As Floridians have returned to the beaches after shutdown orders were lifted, they have been leaving behind garbage.
""Beachgoers trash Florida beaches with 13,000 pounds of litter after beaches reopen,"" stated a headline on the Truththeory website and posted on Facebook May 12, 2020.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the Facebook post has some truth to it.
We found that the number of 13,000 pounds was correct, however it would have been more accurate to refer to the materials as ""garbage"" rather than ""litter"" because some of it was found in trash bins. Also, it was a reference to one specific beach in the state, as explained in the story.
The Facebook post cites a May 9 article by Florida Today about the amount of garbage found on Cocoa Beach once restrictions were lifted.
Starting in late March and then April, the city of Cocoa Beach posted rules that significantly limited use of the beach including the hours, parking and group sizes. But in recent weeks those rules were loosened -- and that’s when the garbage piled up.

The city has a contract with Keep Brevard Beautiful to pick up litter on about a five-mile stretch of Cocoa Beach. Typically, they collect  between 30 and 50 bags per day, executive director Bryan Bobbitt told PolitiFact. Each bag weighs 40 to 50 pounds.
On Friday, May 1, the organization collected about 33 bags. That grew to 122 bags on Saturday and 142 on Sunday. 
In total over that weekend, about 13,560 pounds of garbage was removed, City Manager James McKnight told PolitiFact. Most of the trash was in trash cans or bagged next to trash cans, he said, however a significant amount was picked up directly from the beach itself. 
The police department announced it would fine violators $250 for littering.

A headline said ""beachgoers trash Florida beaches with 13,000 pounds of litter after beaches reopen."" 
That referred to the amount of garbage collected during the first weekend in May at Cocoa Beach. It was the amount of garbage collected from trash bins as well as from the beach, which means it wasn’t all improperly discarded litter.

Joe Biden","Yes, coronavirus deaths in red states add up to second-highest in the world




If Your Time is short





Biden is on track with his claim that “red states” alone in the U.S. would have a combined coronavirus death toll that tops most of the world  


If a red state isdefined as one that voted for Trump in 2016, he’s spot-on. 


If it’s a state that currently has a Republican governor, he’s mostly accurate: Those red state death tolls would rank third in the world, not second


Regardless, one cannot split death counts by partisan control of states. The U.S. has exceeded 205,000 deaths as of Sept. 29, 2020, the most in the world.





See the sources for this fact-check




Former President Barack Obama once famously said ""the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states"" -- instead of simply the United States.
But in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, the candidates themselves are creating these separate ""countries"" to make their point about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
In a campaign stop in Manitowoc on Sept. 21, 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden struck back at an assertion Republican President Donald Trump had made earlier in the month about coronavirus deaths: That so-called ""blue states"" were driving the country’s high death rates. 
Trump, trying to burnish his performance in combating the virus, had said if those states were removed from the equation, the United States would really be ""at a very low level"" of deaths. 
In Manitowoc, where Biden visited a foundry, he said Trump was wrong. 
""If you just count all the deaths in the red states, we are number two in the world in deaths, just behind Brazil,"" Biden said. 
Trump is off track in claiming that U.S. coronavirus deaths, which have topped 200,000,  would be low if some states were not counted — an illogical argument from the get-go, because the country cannot be split that way. 
Biden, meanwhile, is mostly on track in claiming that if red states somehow were split off, they would still account for the second-highest death counts in the world, depending on how you define red and blue states. 
Let’s dig in. 
Defining ""red states"" by states that voted for Trump in 2016
When asked for evidence for Biden’s claim, a Biden campaign spokesperson pointed to a Sept, 16, 2020, analysis piece from the Washington Post, which tallies virus deaths by which 2016 presidential candidate a state supported. 
By that analysis, and as of that date, the author wrote, more than 90,000 deaths had occurred in red states, which would have ranked second in the world. 
The argument holds up even after considering more recent death tolls. The 30 states that Trump took in 2016 had recorded 97,329 deaths in total as of Sept. 28, 2020. Here’s the breakdown, according to a New York Times case and death tracker:

If we were to only count these states, the death total as of that date would fit between Brazil at the top of the chart (141,741) and India at number three (95,542), making Biden’s claim spot-on. 
Defining ""red states"" as states that have Republican governors 
Biden characterized red and blue states in a different way during his speech. 
""Think about what (Trump) is saying. He's saying, if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you're not his problem. He has no obligation to you,"" the former vice president said. 
That’s defining blue states as states with Democratic governors, which Trump himself may have been getting at with his comment about blue states, in which, at one point, he cited ""blue state-managed"" leadership. 
It still doesn’t make Trump’s claim accurate. It does, however, make Biden’s a bit less of a bullseye.
The 26 states whose governors are currently Republicans had a combined total of 83,695 deaths as of Sept. 28, 2020, behind Brazil and India, coming in third in the world. Here’s the breakdown:

Still, the facts here are clear. No one can split the nation in half based on political parties to spin death counts one way or another.
