The CDC recommended in March many ways voters could minimize contact with other people, including voting by mail.

 
The CDC also recommended ways that in-person voting sites could adjust to the pandemic, such as encouraging early voting, drive-up voting and voting at off-peak times.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has encouraged voting by mail, but that doesn’t mean it ruled out in-person voting.
""The CDC has recommended mail in voting. That’s what this whole pandemic is about: the election!"" stated a May 7 Facebook post.
In March, the CDC posted recommendations for elections. At the time, many states were slated to have presidential primaries. Some were delayed amid concerns they could hasten transmission of the novel coronavirus, which spreads primarily from person to person through respiratory droplets expelled while breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing.
The CDC’s recommendations listed voting by mail as one of multiple options. 
The CDC recommended that election officials ""encourage voters to use voting methods that minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling stations."" Those specific recommendations included encouraging ""mail-in methods of voting if allowed in the jurisdiction."" 
It also encouraged early voting, drive-up voting and voting at off-peak times. The CDC also recommended moving polling sites away from homes for senior citizens, sanitizing election equipment and encouraging social distancing at polling sites.
We contacted the CDC to see if there had been additional guidance since March and did not get a response.
It’s important to note that the CDC’s recommendations are intended as public health guidance; they aren’t equivalent to law. Generally, states set laws that outline their rules for voting by mail, early voting and Election Day voting. Local officials administer elections, which means the CDC can’t ban in-person voting.

Just a handful of states hold only mail-in voting by law. In the other states, elections officials expect a massive increase in requests for absentee ballots, but they are still planning to provide in-person voting options. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered that all eligible voters receive absentee ballots, however there will be in-person voting sites as well.

The Facebook post plays into a conspiracy that Democrats are overhyping the pandemic to expand mail-in voting and help their chances in November. But the pandemic’s origin is in no way tied to the American election.
The COVID-19 infection outbreak was first detected in China in late December and quickly spread internationally. The World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 11. Research shows that the genetic makeup of the virus precludes it from being man-made.

A Facebook post said ""The CDC has recommended mail in voting. That’s what this whole pandemic is about: the election!"" 
In March, the CDC issued multiple recommendations to reduce the chance that voters would interact with each other, including voting by mail. But the CDC also recommended other ways voters could cast ballots, including at early voting sites or at off-peak times on election day.

See the sources for this fact-check




Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has targeted what he sees as a couple of key failures by President Donald Trump that made the coronavirus crisis worse. In a CNN virtual town hall, Biden talked about the early days as the virus spread from China.
""I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what's actually happening,"" Biden said March 27. ""There was no effort to do that. He didn't put any pressure on (Chinese President) Xi. I guess because of his trade deal, which wasn't much of a deal. And in addition to that, what happened was, we had one person in-country who was working. He pulled him out of the country.""
There are two claims to sort out: that Trump made no effort to get American epidemiologists into China, and that he pulled out the one person who was working there.
Biden’s first claim distorts the American response, and the second skips over other changes that took place at the same time. 
China resisted all outsiders
The words of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Jan. 28 undercut Biden’s sweeping statement that ""there was no effort"" to get experts into China.
Azar said that by Jan. 6, about a week after China confirmed the existence of a new virus, ""we offered to send a CDC team to China.""
""I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China's Minister of Health on Monday (Jan. 27), and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today,"" Azar said. ""We are urging China: More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response.""
There is no question that China resisted the presence of outside experts.
The World Health Organization was working its own medical diplomacy to get more visibility into the China situation. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with Xi on Jan. 28 in Beijing. That was a month into the pandemic and while he won approval for the deployment of a WHO team, that didn’t happen until Feb. 10.
The WHO group included some Americans, but in a statement, the Health and Human Services Departments said the Chinese ""limited the ability and timing for CDC staff to participate in the WHO joint mission.""
Biden’s campaign staff said that Trump himself should have pressed the issue in his conversations with Xi. We asked the White House press office if he had and got no comment.

Regardless, Azar, a high-ranking member of the cabinet, did tell his Chinese counterpart that the United States was ready to provide people.  In a Jan. 27 tweet, Trump said he had broadly done the same.
""We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary,"" Trump said.
Removing the one person in China
Biden said Trump pulled the ""one person"" in China ""who was working."" This, his staff said, referred to the July 2019 departure of an American epidemiologist from the CDC’s China office. (The CDC maintains offices in countries around the world. The one in China dates back to 2003.)
Reuters reported that the CDC epidemiologist, Linda Quick, would have been in a position to help Chinese experts respond to the emerging disease precisely because she was embedded in China’s CDC to train Chinese specialists.
The CDC’s website shows that the U.S. staff in China went from eight in March 2019 to three in December 2019. The change was driven by a shift in the U.S. strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department said.
""The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief under the Office of Global AIDS Coordinator moved to a regional model in this region and based on the epidemic in China to date, changes were made to the existing footprint,"" the department’s statement said.
In July 2019, the CDC said it would complete its PEPFAR-funded work in China that year.
The department’s statement also said that CDC began ""scaling up"" before the outbreak. That didn’t necessarily mean additional U.S. staff. The program hires more Chinese staffers than American ones.
Our ruling
Biden said that Trump made ""no effort"" to get American experts into China and pulled the ""one person"" the U.S. had on the ground out of China.
Trump’s personal role is unclear, but his Health and Human Services secretary did make the effort to get U.S. experts inside. The department reached out to China in the first week of January, and secretary Azar asked his Chinese counterpart again in late January. China resisted outsiders, both from the U.S. and WHO. 
Biden’s assertion that Trump pulled the ""one person"" out of China has more substance, but is not as straight-forward as he made it sound. An American CDC epidemiologist left in July and was not replaced. The overall American staff went from eight down to three. According to the Health and Human Services Department, the staff reduction was mainly driven by changes in the U.S. strategy to reduce HIV/AIDS. Biden made it sound as though everyone left, but some CDC staff remained.

Michael Caputo","Is Cuomo directive to blame for nursing home COVID deaths as HHS official claims?




If Your Time is short




New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been dogged by criticism for months over his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19.

 
In May, the governor amended the March order, prohibiting hospitals from discharging patients to nursing homes unless they tested negative for COVID-19.

 
The state health department issued a report in July that concluded the deadly coronavirus was introduced by nursing home staffers rather than sick patients.

 
Though some epidemiologists and nursing home advocates questioned the report’s methods and findings, public health experts agreed with the report’s conclusion — based on the timeline — that nursing home staffers and visitors, before they were banned, were likely the main drivers of COVID-19 infection and death in nursing homes.




See the sources for this fact-check




Editor’s note, Feb. 16, 2021: In recent weeks, N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has faced increasing scrutiny regarding his handling of information related to covid-related deaths among nursing home residents. A recent report by N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James noted that the death count may be 50% higher than what Cuomo’s administration provided. The attorney general’s estimate includes deaths that occurred after residents were transferred to the hospital, for example, a potential for undercounting that was mentioned in this fact check. The fact check itself focused on a policy issued by Cuomo in March directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having covid-19. As long as they were medically stable, the notice said, it was appropriate to move patients in. Our ruling of Mostly False is unchanged by this new information. That rating was based on evidence that while the introduction of covid-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on the spread of the coronavirus, Caputo’s statement suggested it was solely responsible. That’s not what the evidence showed, then or now.
On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was among the first in a weeklong parade of speakers to issue scathing critiques of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response.
Cuomo’s criticisms drew a quick reply in a tweet from Michael R. Caputo, an assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services.
""Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?"" he wrote.

It was an easy jab: Cuomo has been dogged by criticism for months over his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. As long as they were medically stable, the notice said, it was appropriate to move patients in. Further, nursing homes were prohibited from requiring that medically stable prospective residents be tested for the virus before they arrived.
Between March 25 and May 8, approximately 6,326 COVID-positive patients were admitted to nursing homes, according to a state health department report.
While experts say this policy was flawed, is it fair to say that the governor’s directive ""forced"" nursing homes to take patients who were sick with COVID-19? And to what extent did that strategy sow the seeds of disease and death? When we examined the evidence, we found it was less clear cut than the statement makes it seem. The policy likely had an effect, but epidemiologists identified additional factors that fed the problem. What’s more the policy did not ""force"" nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients. Nursing homes interpreted it this way. 
We checked with HHS to find the basis for Caputo’s comment but got no response.
The back story
As the virus tore through nursing homes, killing dozens at some of them, Cuomo came under withering censure. His administration’s policy, implemented with an eye toward freeing up hospital beds for an onslaught of COVID patients, seemed to disregard the risks to frail and elderly nursing home residents who were especially vulnerable to the disease.
According to the COVID Tracking Project, 6,624 people have died of COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in New York, accounting for 26% of the state’s 25,275 COVID deaths. Some say the true number of deaths is much higher because, unlike many states, New York does not count the deaths of former nursing home residents who are transferred to hospitals and die there as nursing home deaths.
Cuomo’s explanation for the policy — that he was simply following guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — didn’t cut it. A recent PolitiFact piece examining his claim rated it ""Mostly False.""
In May, the governor amended the March order, prohibiting hospitals from discharging patients to nursing homes unless they tested negative for COVID-19.
A misguided approach
In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when New York was the epicenter and more than a thousand people were being hospitalized daily, there was genuine fear that hospitals would not be able to accommodate the influx of desperately ill patients.
Moving people out of the hospitals and into nursing homes was one strategy to help hospitals meet these needs.
According to the CDC guidance cited in the earlier PolitiFact story, there were two factors to consider when deciding whether to discharge a patient with COVID-19 to a long-term care facility: whether the patient was medically ready, and whether the facility could implement the recommended infection control procedures to safely care for a patient recovering from the virus.
A document from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said nursing homes should accept only patients they were able to care for.
Long-standing state guidance is based on the same condition.
Still, nursing homes didn’t believe turning away patients with COVID-19 was an option.
""On its face it looked like a requirement,"" said Christopher Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, which represents medical professionals in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. ""The nursing homes we spoke to felt it was a mandate, and a number of them felt they had no choice but to take COVID patients.""

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







While the overarching guidance not to take patients in unless they could be safely cared for may have been clear, nursing homes’ experience was often different, said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long-Term Care Community Coalition, an advocacy group for elderly and disabled people. ""There was little reason for nursing homes to think they should only take in patients if they have the ability to do so safely because those rules are not generally enforced on a regular basis.""
Bottom line: State and federal rules didn’t force nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients, but many of them believed they had no other choice.
A lethal result?
How much of the blame for the deaths of thousands of people in nursing homes from COVID-19 can be attributed to Cuomo’s March advisory?
That is the 6,000-person question.
In a July analysis of COVID-19 nursing home deaths, the state concluded that the deadly virus was introduced by nursing home staff members rather than sick patients.
It noted that peak nursing home resident mortality from COVID-19 on April 8 preceded the peak influx of COVID patients on April 14. In addition, it found that nearly 1 in 4 nursing home workers — 37,500 people — were infected with the virus between March and early June.
Based on these and other factors, the report concluded that the state admissions policy could not have been a driver of nursing home infections or fatalities.
Epidemiologists and nursing home advocates beg to differ.
""To say that introducing patients [to nursing homes] who had COVID did not cause problems is ridiculous,"" said Laxton.
Calling the study’s approach ""pretty flawed,"" Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at City University of New York School of Public Health, said he didn’t agree with the report’s conclusion that the policy had nothing to do with deaths.
Others had the same view. ""I didn’t think they showed data to say [the policy] is not a ‘driver,’"" said Rupak Shivakoti, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.
But Gary Holmes, assistant commissioner at the New York State Department of Health, had a different take. Critics of the report, he said, must be deliberately ignoring the rising death tolls in nursing homes in hot spots across the country.
""Public health officials in those states are experiencing (and acknowledging) what NY’s report indicated weeks ago: these facilities are microcosms of the community and transmission is occurring unknowingly by asymptomatic spread among staff members,"" Holmes said, in an email.
While public health experts quibbled with the report’s self-serving claim that the governor’s policy wasn’t a factor in COVID-19 nursing home deaths, they nevertheless agreed with the report’s broader conclusion that nursing home staffers as well as visitors, before they were banned, were likely the main drivers of COVID-19 infection and death in nursing homes.
""Based on the timeline of the policy and deaths in the city, it is very unlikely that policy contributed to thousands of deaths,"" said Shivakoti.
Infection control is a long-standing problem at nursing homes, Nash said, and the COVID deaths were a basic failure of infection control. That said, ""it’s unclear how many of the deaths the policy might have caused.""
Also unclear: how many of the dead were grandmothers and grandfathers.
Our ruling
In a tweet, the HHS assistant secretary for public affairs said that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""forced"" nursing homes across the state to admit COVID-positive patients and that this policy fueled the spread of COVID-19 that led to thousands of deaths in the nursing home population.
Although nursing homes felt pressure to accept COVID-positive patients, they were not actually forced to do so. State regulations require nursing homes to accept patients only if they can care for them, and they could have refused them on those grounds.
In addition, it’s unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Infection control is a longstanding problem in nursing homes that predates the pandemic and a report showed peak numbers of nursing home deaths came prior to the peak influx of patients as a result of Cuomo’s advisory. While the introduction of COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on infection spread, Caputo’s statement suggests it was solely responsible. That’s not what the evidence shows.

The U.S. was not on a list of countries receiving COVID-19 tests from the WHO. But the U.S. doesn’t usually rely on the agency for diagnostic tests, and the testing delay was due mainly to an error with the CDC’s protocol.

Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as disorganized and short-sighted. On Instagram, the critics include some celebrities.
On March 15, actor and comedian D.L. Hughley posted a screenshot of a tweet that makes several claims about the Trump administration’s actions against coronavirus.
""Dear President Trump,"" reads the tweet, which was published March 13 by an account called Translate Trump. ""YOU cut funding to the CDC; YOU fired the Pandemic Response Team; YOU refused WHO tests; YOU wasted 2 weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax.’""
""This is a (sic) what a failed public response to a pandemic looks like.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had more than 42,000 likes as of March 17.

(Screenshot from Instagram)
In the United States, the coronavirus had infected 4,226 people in 49 states, with 94 deaths, as of March 17. On March 11, Trump announced several sweeping actions to slow the spread of the virus, including a ban on travel from a slate of European countries.
Some public health experts have said the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic has been too slow, but are the four claims shown in Hughley’s Instagram post accurate? We looked at each one.
The Instagram post has elements of truth but leaves out a lot of important information. We reached out to Translate Trump and the White House for comments, but we haven’t heard back.
Trump ""cut funding to the CDC""
While it’s not accurate to say that Trump ""cut"" funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is accurate to say he tried.
The Trump administration’s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at the CDC — a key player in the fight against coronavirus — have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year. 
However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as it sees fit when it crafts final spending bills.
Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed funding bills — which he has signed — that not only exceeded what Trump requested for emerging infections but also exceeded the previous year’s spending.
As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020. (We have not included the 2017 proposal, since that was submitted by the Obama administration. The figures for 2020 are preliminary.)

On Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for a $2.5 billion supplemental budget to help combat the emergence of this coronavirus. House Democrats said the amount was insufficient, and instead passed an $8.3 billion bill that Trump signed March 6. The money will fund efforts to develop a vaccine and help local governments respond to the pandemic. 
Trump ""fired the Pandemic Response Team""
This needs context. ""Fired"" is a strong term for what happened, and Trump recently created a team to lead the government’s response to COVID-19.
In May 2018, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council, left the administration. He was in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics.
After Ziemer’s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease, left shortly after Bolton arrived.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







The White House didn’t replace either White House official or his team. Instead, Trump looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. 
In January, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. On Feb. 26, he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would take charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus. 
Trump ""refused WHO tests""
This contains a hint of truth, but it’s mostly inaccurate. Former Vice President Joe Biden made a similar claim during the March 15 Democratic presidential debate.
A March 6 Politico article says the World Health Organization shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is correct, but it suggests that the U.S. would normally have been on the list, which is not the case.
""No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,"" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. ""This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.""
RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump’s mistakes about European travel due to coronavirus
Instead, the U.S. decided to have the CDC develop its own testing protocol, which was published Jan. 28. This caused a lag in testing for the virus in the U.S.
The CDC’s test was different and more complicated than a test published in Germany on Jan. 17. It worked in the CDC lab, but when the materials went out to state labs, some of them got inconsistent results. The CDC had to resend packages with new chemical reagents.
State laboratories started developing their own tests and were ready to use them, but had to wait for emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The combined delays resulted in fewer Americans being tested and a slower U.S. response overall compared with some other countries. 
Trump ""wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax.’""
This is inaccurate. 
During a Feb. 28 campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump called the Democratic response to COVID-19 a ""hoax."" But he did not use the term to describe the virus itself.
During a press conference Feb. 29, Trump was asked about his remarks.
""I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing,"" he said, referring to Democrats. ""That's the hoax.""
Trump’s comments feed into a conspiracy theory that claims Democrats and the media are fabricating the threat of COVID-19 to hurt the economy and the president’s re-election chances. And the president appeared to downplay the threat of the virus at several points in recent weeks.
But to say that Trump called the virus itself a hoax is false. Plus, the administration took its first action in January by setting up a task force to address the spread of the coronavirus.
Our ruling
An Instagram post made four claims that criticize Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The first, that he ""cut funding to the CDC,"" is partially accurate; Trump tried to cut the agency’s funding, but Congress prevented it from happening. On the second claim, while saying Trump ""fired"" the ""Pandemic Response Team"" is a stretch, it’s true that National Security Council staffers left abruptly in 2018 and were not replaced. 
The third claim, that Trump ""refused WHO tests,"" contains a hint of truth, but is mostly inaccurate since the U.S. does not usually rely on the WHO for testing protocols. And the fourth claim, which says Trump ""wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax,’"" is inaccurate — the president has not called the virus itself a ""hoax,"" just the Democrats’ response to it.
As a whole, the Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Coronavirus







Jeff Jackson","Why are NC liquor stores considered essential?




If Your Time is short




Liquor stores in North Carolina, known as ABC stores, are considered essential businesses during the coronavirus lockdown.
A Democratic state Senator said the stores are essential because some people are dependant on alcohol and, if they don't get it, they'll go into withdrawal and ""flood"" emergency rooms.
Neither Gov. Roy Cooper, nor his Executive Order or administration, ever specifically mentioned a concern for hospitals as a reason liquor stores are allowed to remain open.

To limit the spread of coronavirus, authorities are asking some businesses to close and allowing some to stay open.
That’s the case in North Carolina, where Gov. Roy Cooper has issued a stay-at-home order and deemed some businesses ""essential."" Gas stations, grocery stores and home supply stores like Home Depot are among the businesses considered essential and allowed to stay open. 
North Carolina’s state-run liquor stores are also considered essential. 
Why? NC state Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Democrat from Mecklenburg County, recently addressed that question on Twitter.
""Why are liquor stores still open?"" Jackson asked rhetorically in an April 6 tweet.
""It’s because we have a lot of people who are chemically dependent on alcohol and if we suddenly cut off their access they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms, which we can’t have right now,"" he said.

Is that true?
What state officials say
The governor’s office is in charge of designating which businesses are ""essential"" and allowed to stay open. But Cooper’s executive order didn’t offer a reason why liquor stores or any other businesses are considered essential.
Kelly Haight Connor, spokeswoman for North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, told PolitiFact in an email that the reasoning was simple.
""People need to stay home as much as possible. And while restaurants, bars and other areas of communal gathering must be closed, people should be able to buy items used in their day to day lives,"" she said.
PolitiFact could find no proof that Cooper’s decision to designate liquor stores as essential businesses was made to accommodate people who might be dependent on alcohol. 
Further, if liquor stores were hypothetically asked to close, North Carolinians could still access alcohol in the form of wine and beer at grocery stores.
When we reached out to Jackson about this claim, his office noted that individual ABC boards across the state have the flexibility to decide whether or not they want to remain open.

Jeff Strickland, a spokesman for the ABC Commission, confirmed each of the state’s 170 boards does, indeed, have that freedom. ""If a board wants to close down, they have that authority,"" Strickland said.
The commission doesn’t have an official stance on why its stores should or shouldn’t remain open, he added.
What some ABC owners say
To that end, Jackson’s office pointed out that some ABC store operators have cited alcohol dependency as a reason for staying open.
Jackson’s office emailed us an article by WLOS in Asheville, where local ABC manager Jason Thacker told WLOS that he’s heard concerns about overwhelming hospitals.
""Studies show that abruptly limiting access to alcohol could lead to an increase in withdrawal for people with severe alcohol use disorder and add to the burden of the health care system, which is the last thing that needs to happen right now,"" Thacker told WLOS.
Jackson’s office also provided links to stories about why liquor stores are being kept open in other states such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas. In Connecticut, for example, Gov. Ned Lamont said there’s a medical reason behind the exemption for liquor stores.
""I think the thought process by the (Connecticut) governor is that if we do close the liquor stores this could create an unnecessary problem and really cut off a needed resource,"" Dr. Andrew Lim, the medical director of Bristol Hospital’s Emergency Department, told NBC News in Connecticut.
However, addiction specialists aren’t unified in their belief that liquor store access will prevent emergency room admissions. 
John Watkins, who owns Johnston Counseling Services, told WRAL that people who are physically dependent on alcohol could suffer withdrawal symptoms in less than a day if they can’t access it.
But Ward Blanchard, president of The Blanchard Institute addiction recovery center in Charlotte, told Spectrum News that leaving ABC stores open could also lead to ER admissions. He said some who are dependent on alcohol could, if left alone with high volumes of it, go overboard.
""When you are in a situation where people are isolated and there is already stress and anxiety, and then you throw liquor on top of that, I think that would overthrow a healthcare system more so than closing it would,"" Blanchard said.
Our ruling
Jackson said liquor stores are still open because ""we have a lot of people who are chemically dependent on alcohol and if we suddenly cut off their access they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms, which we can’t have right now.""
Gov. Cooper is responsible for determining which businesses are considered essential, and his administration hasn’t mentioned alcohol dependency as a reason for the designation. 
The only evidence Jackson cited was an ABC operations manager in Asheville who said some store owners are concerned about closures potentially affecting the hospital system. But it’s not clear that that concern is shared among all 170 ABC store owners.

Facebook posts","Post overstates study’s ‘200%’ finding on hydroxychloroquine’s power vs COVID-19




If Your Time is short





A study says a certain dosing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin “improves survival by nearly 200%” among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation.


The study is posted on a website that publishes “preprints” — studies that “have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.”


Experts called the study poorly designed and caution against drawing conclusions about cause and effect.





See the sources for this fact-check




When President Donald Trump released a statement listing things he said ""I was right about,"" the top item listed was ""Hydroxychloroquine works.""
As president, Trump controversially touted hydroxychloroquine, starting in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, despite a lack of evidence on whether it was safe or effective for use against COVID-19. But days before he released his June 12 statement on his website, news of a study surfaced that triggered more claims about the drug.
""Study: hydroxychloroquine can boost COVID-19 survival chances by nearly 200%,"" read the headline of a widely shared post on Instagram.
The post was from One America News, the conservative cable network that Trump has often praised. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post exaggerates the significance of the study, which promotes hydroxychloroquine as helping only certain COVID-19 patients.
The study says a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was effective in certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but the study has not been fully vetted. It was posted on a website that publishes ""preprints"" — studies the website says are not yet peer reviewed by other scholars and that ""should not be used to guide clinical practice.""
Experts told PolitiFact the study is poorly designed and cautioned against using it to draw conclusions.
Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19
Hydroxychloroquine, which is an immunosuppressive and anti-parasitic drug used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to malaria, carries a particular risk for people with heart problems, plus other possible side effects.
Interest in the drug emerged early in the pandemic, in early 2020, from two small trials, including one that used hydroxychloroquine along with the antibiotic azithromycin (brand name Zithromax) and reported that the virus was essentially gone in five days. The research society that published that article later renounced it, saying it didn’t meet its standards.
In March 2020, as Trump touted hydroxychloroquine, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of hydroxychloroquine for certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But the FDA revoked its authorization less than three months later, after determining ""it is no longer reasonable"" to believe that it may be effective in treating COVID-19, ""nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks."" 
What the study found
The study cited by OAN was done by three researchers from the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases & Urban Health in East Orange, N.J., and one from the Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. The study says the researchers reviewed the medical records of 255 COVID-19 patients at Saint Barnabas who required invasive mechanical ventilation during the first two months of the U.S. pandemic. Its conclusion: Dosing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin above a certain level ""improves survival by nearly 200% in this population.""

The study was posted May 31 on medRxiv, a website that publishes studies that have not been fully vetted. This note is posted with the study: ""This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice."" 
The website also says about its ""preprint"" or ""unrefereed"" articles: ""Before formal publication in a scholarly journal, scientific and medical articles are traditionally certified by ‘peer review.’ In this process, the journal’s editors take advice from various experts — called ‘referees’ — who have assessed the paper and may identify weaknesses in its assumptions, methods and conclusions … Readers should therefore be aware that articles on medRxiv have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors, and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.""
Expert views
Three experts who spoke to PolitiFact were critical of the study.
Joel Farley, a University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy professor, noted that the study was designed not to test the effectiveness of the two drugs, but rather as an observational study that basically looks at survival and then models what things might have predicted survival. 
""The concern is that this poorly designed study might influence"" prescribing of the two drugs ""when the overwhelming body of evidence has shown it has no benefit for treating COVID,"" Farley said.
Dr. Neil Schluger, chairman of the Department of Medicine at New York Medical College, said that to conclude cause-and-effect ""is an obvious error,"" calling the study very small with little hard data. ""It’s likely that patients who died rapidly received less total (of the two drugs) because they were dead; one can’t conclude from these data that they died because they got fewer doses. It’s also likely that if they received lower doses on a daily basis, it’s because they were sicker to begin with,"" he said.
Ally Dering-Anderson, a professor at the University of Nebraska College of Pharmacy, said pairing hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin to treat a virus raises serious questions because azithromycin is a traditional antibacterial drug that doesn’t treat viruses and hydroxychloroquine has no known benefit in treating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. ""There is no pharmacologically sound reason to believe that combining two drugs that don’t work will suddenly result in therapy that does work,"" she said.
Hydroxychloroquine is not approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. The FDA recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treating COVID-19 patients. The World Health Organization recommends against using hydroxychloroquine to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infection.
Our ruling
A widely shared social media post stated: ""Study: hydroxychloroquine can boost COVID-19 survival chances by nearly 200%.""
A study says a certain dosing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin ""improves survival by nearly 200%"" among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation, but the post exaggerates the finding’s significance.

Donald Trump","Trump repeats flawed claim that Biden opposed Trump’s coronavirus travel restrictions on China




If Your Time is short





Joe Biden did not directly say that he thought President Donald Trump shouldn’t have restricted travel from China to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.


Biden did accuse Trump of ""xenophobia"" in an Iowa campaign speech the same day that the administration announced the travel restrictions — Jan. 31 — but his campaign said his remarks were not related, and that he made similar comments before the restrictions were imposed.





See the sources for this fact-check




In the final presidential debate, Democratic candidate Joe Biden repeated his claim that President Donald Trump has mishandled the nation’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Trump shot back in defense, and claimed that Biden himself thought that the administration was wrong in restricting travel from China on Jan. 31, 2020, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading in the United States. 
""When I closed he said I should no't have closed,"" Trump said. ""He said this is a terrible thing, you are a xenophobe, I think he called me racist. Now he says I should have closed it earlier."" 
""I did not say either of those things,"" Biden responded. ""I talked about his xenophobia in a different context, not about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.""
As debate moderator Kristen Welker interjected to ask another question, Trump continued: ""He thought I shouldn't have closed the borders. That's obvious.""
This isn’t accurate. 
Biden did not directly say that he thought Trump shouldn’t have restricted travel from China when he did. The former vice president did accuse Trump of ""xenophobia"" in an Iowa campaign speech the same day, Jan. 31, that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the administration's travel restrictions on people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the U.S.
Biden said: ""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.""

RELATED: Fact-checking whether Biden called Trump ‘xenophobic’ for restrictions on travel from China
Biden’s presidential campaign told the Washington Post Fact Checker that his accusations were not related to the travel restrictions, claiming he wasn’t aware of the restrictions during his speech since the event started shortly after they were announced. The campaign also noted he made similar remarks in an opinion column published Jan. 27 in USA Today. And in his comments in Iowa, Biden did not mention the travel restrictions.
On Feb. 1, Biden mostly repeated his remarks from the campaign stop, tweeting: ""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.""
Biden did not say whether he supported or opposed the Trump travel restrictions until April 3, when his campaign said that he supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.
""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" the campaign told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.""
Our ruling
Trump said, ""When I closed he said I should not have closed. ...He said this is a terrible thing, you are a xenophobe, I think he called me racist. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. … He thought I should not have closed the border. That’s obvious.""
Biden didn’t take an official position on the China travel restrictions until months after they were first enforced. And while he has called Trump a racist and xenophobic, those comments weren’t explicity in reference to the travel ban. 
Trump’s claim contains an element of truth, but overstates and takes Biden’s comments out of context. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Facebook posts","No, a recent study didn’t find that there was “no asymptomatic” spread of COVID-19




If Your Time is short



• The journal article in question found people with symptoms were more contagious than those without, but asymptomatic people did transmit the virus. 
• The paper looks only at household transmission, not community spread. An asymptomatic individual who went out in the community could still infect a sizable number of people.
• The paper itself warns that the number of studies looking at asymptomatic transmission is small, making it hard to draw sweeping conclusions. 



See the sources for this fact-check




Critics of policies to contain community spread of the coronavirus have taken to social media to tout a study they said showed no risk of asymptomatic individuals spreading the virus.
This argument was shared on Twitter by Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, and was later amplified by Tomi Lahren, the conservative commentator and Fox Nation host, on both Twitter and Facebook. 
Martin tweeted, ""Report: University of Florida researchers have found no asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread of Covid. The study was published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association. This could change everything.""
Lahren shared Martin’s tweet, adding the comment, ""So ya mean locking down the country, destroying businesses, robbing students of real learning and shaming people into giving up our rights was not necessary?! Ya don’t say....""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
 
Neither social media post provided a link to the study in question, but it appears to be a paper published on Dec. 14 in JAMA Network Open, an open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association. The article was co-authored by four researchers from the University of Florida and two affiliated with the University of Washington.
We reached out to several medical experts, including one of the co-authors, and they agreed that the portrayal of the journal article on social media ignored several caveats included in the article and made unjustified logical leaps. (Attempts to reach out to Martin and Lahren were unsuccessful.)
What the study found
The study was a ""meta-analysis"" — a paper that pools existing studies on a topic and tries to draw broader conclusions using a larger data set than any of the studies had individually. 
Specifically, the study looked at how much the virus spread within households. The researchers found that among the studies that met their parameters, the ""secondary attack rates"" — that is, the likelihood of spread from an infected person to a previously uninfected person within a household — were higher among people who had symptoms than among those who didn’t: 18% for symptomatic individuals vs. 0.7% for asymptomatic individuals.
The notion that people with symptoms are more likely to infect others is not a new one. Coughing, for example, is a symptom of COVID-19 and an especially effective way to spread the virus. One meta-analysis study published in September by researchers from Harvard University, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom found that ""asymptomatic patients can transmit"" the virus to others, but that ""such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies."" Other studies have also shown reduced rates of transmission among asymptomatic individuals. 
In other words, there’s consistent evidence that asymptomatic individuals are less likely to spread the virus than symptomatic individuals are. But the paper didn’t find the rate of spread to be zero. Moreover, Martin’s original tweet mischaracterized the paper’s conclusions, and Lahren’s comment exacerbated the misunderstanding. 
Here are the two major fallacies, according to experts.
Problem 1: The paper notes that there is little data on asymptomatic spread
Only four of the 54 studies analyzed in the paper even tracked asymptomatic spread, making it hard to draw detailed conclusions. The paper noted this twice, cautioning that ""less data were available"" on asymptomatic cases and that ""there were few studies"" involving asymptomatic individuals.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic spread was ""notable, but it was not meant to upend"" the broader understanding of the subject, said Natalie E. Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, and one of the co-authors of the paper.
The paucity of data on asymptomatic spread is not surprising, experts said, since it requires a more extensive testing regimen, raising the cost and difficulty for researchers.
Such studies ""would require repeated, complete-household testing to ascertain causality and the origin and timing of infections in the household,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. 
In fact, Nichols said, we simply don’t know enough yet to determine how commonly asymptomatic spread occurs. ""The four studies that the JAMA Open Network meta-analysis has reviewed had remarkably small sample sizes, and the studies were not designed to answer this specific question,"" Nichols said.
Problem 2: The study addresses household spread, not community spread
The study in question looked only at spread within households. A household is a more limited environment that is easier to control and study than a full community.
The study’s focus on households, rather than on community spread, is relevant because Lahren’s critique largely addresses policies that govern community interactions, such as restrictions on businesses, public gatherings and schools.
The course of the spread in the United States makes clear that most transmission has been occurring at the community level, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine, health policy and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University.
""It is self-evident that here in the U.S. and in other countries, when we have let down our guard, that's been followed by an explosion of COVID transmission that results in people being put into hospitals and ICUs,"" Schaffner said. ""Countries such as Australia and New Zealand that have really instituted these interventions, including masking, social distancing, and controlling the size of groups, have controlled the spread better than any other countries.""
In addition, the papers that have addressed community spread suggest that asymptomatic spread does occur. 
Experts added that while one might think that transmission of the virus is more likely to occur in the enclosed spaces of a household, this ignores a key factor: Asymptomatic people will encounter many more people if they’re out and about while infected.
""If their viral loads are lower, but their contact rates are higher — the number of people a person sees in one day — then the likelihood of transmission could become similar,"" Nichols said.
Our ruling
Facebook posts said a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by University of Florida researchers has found no asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread of COVID.
The journal article in question did find lower transmission rates from asymptomatic individuals compared with symptomatic individuals, though the rate was not zero, as the post said.
The posts ignore that the paper itself warns that the number of studies looking at asymptomatic transmission is small. And the paper looks only at household transmission, not community spread. Asymptomatic people going about their lives in the community would encounter many more people than someone stuck at home, meaning they could still infect a sizable number of people.

A nurse in Tennessee did become dizzy and was assisted to the ground after taking a COVID-19 vaccine. 


The nurse recovered and later said that her dizziness is something that regularly happens to her after experiencing any kind of pain, even after stubbing a toe.


Becoming dizzy after a vaccine is not unusual for some people, a doctor said. The doctor dismissed the notion that the episode was indicative of something dangerous in the vaccine.

A nearly 18-minute Facebook video seeks to foment doubts about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines by highlighting the case of a Tennessee nurse who became dizzy and fell to the ground after vaccination. The video omits important context: the nurse has a medical history of becoming dizzy even after minimal pain.
""Nurse passes out on live TV after taking vaccine,"" says the caption for the video posted Dec. 18. In the video, Dr. Taylor Marshall, who describes himself as a theologian, philosopher, author, and father of eight children, tells his viewers: ""So there it is. It’s sad. Now, what do we make of this? Why are all these people making publicity moments over taking a vaccine? This shows that from the beginning, from the beginning this whole thing has political and social motives.""
Marshall later in the video says one has to be humble about the potential effects of new drugs and new vaccines in general. ""There is a Frankenstein effect potential, we just don't know what will be the outcome,"" he says.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

CHI Memorial explained what happened in a Dec. 18 tweet: The hospital said that the nurse became dizzy and was assisted to the floor, but never lost consciousness and quickly recovered. CHI Memorial said that in another media interview, after recovering, the nurse said she had a history of an overactive vagal response, and that she passes out if she has pain from anything. Fainting can happen after many types of vaccines, CHI Memorial said, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""The fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine,"" Dr. Jesse L. Tucker, a CHI Memorial critical care physician said in a media interview after the incident. The nurse’s reaction was related to her known medical condition, he said.
In a video posted on Twitter by CHI Memorial, Dover said that a hangnail or stubbing her toe can also cause her to pass out. She said she felt fine and that the pain in her arm from the shot was ""very minimal, actually, but it doesn’t take much,"" for her to pass out. She added that she’s probably passed out six times in the past six weeks. ""It’s common for me,"" she says. Dover said she did not regret taking the COVID-19 vaccine.

Cal Cunningham","NC Democrat misrepresents Tillis position on aid for states




If Your Time is short




U.S. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said he doesn’t want the federal government to help states pay for debt that wasn’t incurred as part of the coronavirus outbreak, which could include allowing them to declare bankruptcy.
U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said he agrees with McConnell “more or less,” but never explicitly said he wants states to declare bankruptcy.
Tillis added that he doesn’t support an “across the board” bailout, and wants to review aid on a “case-by-case basis.”




See the sources for this fact-check




Local and state governments are expected to have budget shortfalls as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
And, according to the Democrat in North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race, the Republican incumbent thinks struggling communities should go bankrupt.
That’s what Cal Cunningham said about Sen. Thom Tillis.
""Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed,"" Cunningham tweeted April 24, linking to a Politico story.

Is that true?
There’s a lot of context being left out.
Yes, Tillis did say he is ""more or less aligned"" with what McConnell, the U.S. Senate majority leader, said about not giving more federal dollars to states that had pre-existing budget problems. McConnell proposed allowing them to file for bankruptcy, which states are not currently permitted to do.
But Cunningham exaggerated what we know about Tillis’ position. Tillis’ comments clearly show he doesn’t want the federal government to pay for state debt that wasn’t incurred during the coronavirus outbreak. What’s less clear is whether he wants those states to go the bankruptcy route.
What McConnell said
So what did McConnell say about bankruptcy? In a radio interview on April 22, McConnell said states with pre-existing problems might be better off declaring bankruptcy than by expecting additional funding from the federal government. But he didn’t specifically say he ""wanted"" states to declare bankruptcy, only that he supports it as an option.
""I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there’s no good reason for it not to be available,"" McConnell said. ""My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don’t have to do that. That’s not something I’m going to be in favor of.""
As The Atlantic reported, McConnell expanded on his bankruptcy comments in another radio interview that day:
""We’re not interested in solving their pension problems for them. We’re not interested in rescuing them from bad decisions they've made in the past, we’re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems that they created themselves (with) bad decisions in the past.""
What Tillis said
That brings us to Tillis and how closely he has ""agreed"" with McConnell.
Audio of the April 24 town hall shows a constituent named Charles saying he has a question about the future: ""Will the Senate vote to bail out poorly-run states that were near bankrupt before COVID-19 hit?""

Tillis wasn’t asked about states in general. He was asked specifically about ""poorly-run states that were near bankrupt"" prior to the pandemic. Tillis said he doesn’t think those states should be bailed out. 
""Well, Charles, that's a great question and personally I don't think we should, and I don't think that we can,"" Tillis said. 
He then said the $2 trillion economic stimulus gave him ""pause,"" but was worth it. Then he used North Carolina’s state government as an example of good financial stewardship:
""I'm not so sure that taxpayer dollars for North Carolina should go to a state, a county, or a city that, like you said, was in poor economic shape before we ever had the virus. We need to take care of first responders. We need to take care of law enforcement. And we will do that. But I don't believe that I can support any measure that is effectively a bailout for poorly run state and local governments.
""We can look at things on a case-by-case basis where it's very clear that the damage is done because of the virus impact. But a broad-based bailout is not something I'd be prepared to support."" 
That’s when Tillis brought up McConnell’s comments.
""You probably heard Leader McConnell's comments about it, I'm more or less aligned with Leader McConnell on the issue,"" Tillis said, a few seconds later adding: ""I think we need to work on executing (plans already signed into law) and not really entertain a discussion of trillions more going into jurisdictions that really need to get their financial houses in order.""
Cunningham spokeswoman Rachel Petri said Tillis’s comments about McConnell show he’s in lockstep with the Senate leader, who said ""I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.""
Tillis elaborated on his position in an interview with Fox News radio's Guy Benson on April 29. Benson asked him about McConnell’s comments that money should not cover pre-pandemic budget holes (without mentioning the bankruptcy idea).
Tillis said the Senate ""will go back and take a look at well-documented cases for the costs of the response, potentially the cause of some of the revenues in this year based on closures."" 
When PolitiFact asked about Tillis’ position on the bankruptcy option, Tillis campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said:
""Sen. Tillis has never advocated for any state or municipality to go bankrupt as a result of COVID-19, has already delivered billions of dollars in relief to North Carolina, and has consistently said that he supports providing targeted assistance for communities that have been impacted by the virus.""
Our ruling
Cunningham tweeted, ""Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed."" The tweet lacks so much context that it’s several degrees removed from what’s actually been said. 
McConnell wasn’t talking about just any states, he was talking about states that were in poor financial shape before the coronavirus outbreak. Additionally, McConnell said he supported bankruptcy as a novel option for states, particularly for those with pre-existing pension liabilities.
Tillis said he agreed with McConnell ""more or less."" He agreed that Congress shouldn’t pay for revenue losses that aren’t related to the coronavirus outbreak. But Tillis never actually said he wanted states to go bankrupt. And he said he will consider federal aid for smaller governments on a case-by-case basis.

Donald Trump","Trump said the Obama admin left him a bare stockpile. Wrong




If Your Time is short





The director of the national stockpile described it as an $8 billion enterprise in November. 


While the stockpile had a lot of goods, it didn’t have all the needed supplies for the nationwide 2020 pandemic.


Reports show that N95 masks were depleted as a result of H1N1 in 2009, and experts warned they should be replenished.


Budget figures going back to 2009 show overall funding for the stockpile dropped to its lowest in 2013, to about $477 million. Allocations have grown steadily since then to a 2020 budget of $705 million.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Obama administration left him with an empty national stockpile for emergencies.
""But they also gave us empty cupboards. The cupboard was bare. You’ve heard the expression, ‘the cupboard was bare.’ So we took over a stockpile with a cupboard that was bare,"" he said in an April 6 White House briefing. In previous briefings Trump described the stockpile as ""empty.""
Trump is exaggerating. While the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted shortcomings in the nation’s stockpile of emergency supplies and equipment, Trump did not inherit bare inventory.
It was full of supplies, but not enough to handle this particular pandemic. Most notably, the stockpile was short of N95 masks, the supply of which was depleted following the 2009 H1N1 outbreak during President Barack Obama’s tenure.
RELATED: Fact-checking Jared Kushner’s comments on the national stockpile
The history of the Strategic National Stockpile 
The Strategic National Stockpile was created in 1999 to prepare for chemical, radiological, biological or nuclear attacks. It expanded to respond to terrorism attacks, hurricanes, the H1N1 flu and ebola.
While the locations of the stockpiles’ warehouses are secret, some reporters have been allowed inside, including journalists from the Washington Post in 2018. The Post wrote that there were ""hundreds of thousands of shrink-wrapped boxes of medicines"" and that if the medical countermeasures were laid flat they would cover more than 31 football fields.
But Dara Alpert Lieberman, director of government relations for the nonprofit Trust for America’s Health, said that as large as the stockpile is, it’s always been lacking. ""The Strategic National Stockpile has never been funded at adequate levels to invest in new medical countermeasures, replenish expiring products, and purchase other needed medical supplies,"" she said. 
A 2017 Health and Human Services report showed $324.5 million in replenishment contracts, more than half of that money for anthrax response and only $7 million earmarked for influenza. 
In November, the director of the stockpile described it as an $8 billion enterprise. ""Even if the needed products are not currently held in house, stockpile experts have purchasing power to get what is needed to protect Americans,"" wrote Greg Burel, who retired in January.
But two months later, it became clear that the stockpile didn’t have all the supplies needed for the current pandemic.
Masks depleted after H1N1
One thing the stockpile clearly doesn’t have enough of is face masks. News reports found that the N95 face masks were not substantially replenished after H1N1 in 2009, the first year of the Obama administration. 
The Obama administration distributed 85 million N95 masks, 12.5 million regimens of antiviral drugs and 19.6 million pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) for H1N1, also called swine flu.
""The 2009 H1N1 response was the largest known response of a national stock of drugs and medical material, and it was successful,"" Burel wrote in 2019.
But experts warned after H1N1 that the supply of masks should have been replenished. Burel told Vice News in March that federal officials were left with ""horrible decisions"" about how to triage spending after H1N1.
""We had to trade off those funds that we had, and we chose to invest in those lifesaving drugs that would not be available from any other source, in the quantity needed, and in time,"" he said. ""I definitely want to see my health care workers protected; that's very important. But if I'm thinking, 'Do I buy this many masks to protect this many workers, or do I buy this many medicines to keep people safe that we can't get elsewhere?' There's no easy answer here.""

Burel told CBS News in March that the stockpile was ""very stressed.""
""We didn't receive funds to replace those masks, protective gear and the antivirals that we used for H1N1,"" he said.
Budget battles hurt funding
ProPublica found that the budget battles during Obama’s tenure after the Republicans won the 2010 election hurt the stockpile’s budget.
In early 2011, Obama’s administration released a budget request for $655 million for the stockpile, an increase of $59 million including to acquire new products. But Congress ultimately allocated $534 million for the 2012 fiscal year, a 10% cut from the prior year, ProPublica found.
Across-the-board cuts hit the CDC, which managed the stockpile at the time.
In its budget request for 2013, for example, the administration called for a cut of about $48 million to the stockpile. The stockpile ""is a key resource in maintaining public health preparedness and response; however, the current fiscal climate necessitates scaling back,"" the request stated.
Budget figures going back to 2009 show overall funding for the stockpile dropped to its lowest in 2013, to about $477 million. Allocations have grown steadily since then to a 2020 budget of $705 million. 
Despite the Obama-era cuts, Ellen Carlin, a professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said it’s an exaggeration to state that the ""cupboard was bare."" 
Appropriations to the stockpile during Obama’s presidency, when adjusting for inflation, went up a little, down a little, and then ended up about where they started.
""But those numbers don’t just reflect Obama’s requests. They also reflect congressional appropriations — under Congresses that at times were partially controlled by Republicans,"" she said. 
It’s difficult to determine what budget cuts meant for PPE since federal officials closely hold the details of the inventory, she said. 
While the Trump administration points the finger at Obama, Democrats have pointed the finger back at Trump, who also could have taken steps to replenish the stockpile before the current pandemic. 
But because of the shared executive branch-legislative branch responsibility, Carlin said, ""almost everything about COVID-19 reflects a bipartisan failure across two branches of government.""
The Associated Press reviewed federal purchasing contracts and found ""federal agencies largely waited until mid-March (of this year) to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers."" While HHS said early in the pandemic that the stockpile had 13 million masks, that was only a fraction of what hospitals needed, the AP found.
Masks are not the only items that federal officials sought to obtain more of for the stockpile in past years. The New York Times reported on efforts that began 13 years ago — before the Obama administration —  to buy more ventilators. That effort stalled when the company that the federal government secured to design new ventilators didn’t come through, leaving the government to start over with a new company in 2014.
Our ruling
Trump said the Obama administration left him with a ""stockpile with a cupboard that was bare.""
In one specific way, he has a point: N95 masks were depleted after the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, and experts warned years ago that the supply should have been replenished. 
However, Trump made a sweeping generalization and exaggerated when he described the stockpile as a bare cupboard. The former director of the stockpile, just a couple of months before COVID-19 cases appeared in the U.S., described it as an $8 billion enterprise, with extensive holdings of many needed items.

Tucker Carlson","Tucker Carlson claims coronavirus ‘poses virtually zero threat’ to children, most teachers




If Your Time is short





Carlson’s language paints a black-and-white picture for children and teachers between death and full recovery. Other outcomes — including hospitalization — have occurred and are also harmful.


There’s a lot we don’t know about long-term health conditions associated with COVID-19.


The risk of severe illness and death due to COVID-19 increases with age and for people with underlying medical conditions.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News host Tucker Carlson downplayed the risk of the coronavirus recently, arguing on his TV show that schools should reopen because, he said, the virus ""poses virtually zero threat"" to children and most working adults.
""For children, the risks of staying locked at home are high,"" Carlson said in the July 7 segment. ""The risks from the coronavirus, by contrast, are not high."" 
""The virus is deadly to the very old and to those who are already sick. We know that,"" he continued. ""But to children and the vast majority of young and middle-aged adults and the vast majority of teachers, it poses virtually zero threat.""
The risk of death from COVID-19 does increase with age and for people with underlying medical conditions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. The CDC’s demographic data shows that older adults account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths.
But ""poses virtually zero threat"" is a loaded phrase, experts said. Carlson’s language paints a black-and-white picture between death and full recovery. A lot can happen in between those two outcomes.
""COVID is definitely not ‘zero threat’ in any of these age groups,"" said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida.
RELATED: Donald Trump’s false claim that 99% of COVID-19 cases are harmless
Death is not the only bad outcome
Fox News pointed to a handful of studies, articles, state statistics and CDC model estimates that identified children and young adults as less likely to fall severely ill or die from the coronavirus. Case fatality rates do rise with age, a recent CDC report on U.S. cases through May 30 shows.
Death is the worst — but least likely — outcome for COVID-19 patients. Counting deaths and calculating fatality rates can be tricky, since deaths due to COVID-19 may be undercounted and epidemiologists still don’t know the exact number of people who were infected.
The CDC provides age-related data as part of its provisional death counts, which lag by a few weeks because they are based on death certificates. The data through July 4 showed the breakdown of cumulative, confirmed COVID-19 deaths to look like this:

 
""Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk,"" the CDC says on its website. 
That doesn’t mean there’s zero threat facing children and the other age groups. Healthy children can still get and spread the virus, although the CDC says children account for a relatively small share of cases. Working-age adults are susceptible to it, too.

RELATED: Some COVID-19 deaths have been children
In fact, people between the ages of 18 and 64 represented roughly 75% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases as of July 12, according to CDC data.
The average age of teachers in 2017-18, the latest year for which data is available, was about 43 years old, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Across all schools, 15.1% of teachers were under age 30; 55.7% were ages 30 to 49; 11.6% were 50 to 54; and 17.6% were 55 or older.
Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, is on a task force advising a local school district in Orange County, where roughly 24% of COVID-19 deaths as of July 9 were patients between 25 and 64 years old.
""I'm thinking of teachers, teachers aides, school nurses, lunchroom staff, administrators, custodial staff and so on,"" Noymer wrote in an email. ""Twenty-four percent of county-wide mortality in this age group is hard to dismiss!""
And it’s not just a matter of death versus no consequences. By most standards, for example, anything that results in a hospitalization has done significant damage. The likelihood of hospitalization rises with age, according to the CDC, but patients of all ages are at risk.
Using data from the recent CDC report on U.S. cases through May 30, we calculated that roughly 7.8% of U.S. COVID-19 patients under the age of 60 were hospitalized in that time, including about 5.3% of patients under 60 who reported no underlying medical conditions.
There’s also plenty left to learn about the long-term effects of infection, experts said. Donald Thea, professor of global health at Boston University, told us that ""mild disease is oftentimes far from mild and can entail profound and prolonged disability.""
Scientists suspect there could be links between mild cases and blood clots, chronic fatigue, strokes and other ailments in young people, according to reports. 
Doctors have also found some cases in which children previously infected with COVID-19 have developed a rare condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome.
""The more and more we learn, we’re seeing things about what this virus can do that we didn’t see from the studies in China or in Europe,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, during a May 12 Senate hearing. ""I think we better be careful (that) we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.""
We also don’t know how schools could change the spread and impact of the coronavirus, said Prins, the University of Florida epidemiologist. ""If you’re opening up and sending kids back to school, you’re under a whole different set of circumstances.""
Our ruling
Carlson said, ""To children and the vast majority of young and middle-aged adults and the vast majority of teachers, (the coronavirus) poses virtually zero threat.""
The risk of dying from COVID-19 does increase with age. But Carlson’s claim that the virus ""poses virtually zero threat"" to the groups he identified ignores the possibility that people from those groups could still wind up sick, hospitalized or facing long-term health conditions.
Many teachers are in the particularly vulnerable age groups.

Rick Scott","Sen. Rick Scott misrepresents COVID-19’s toll on state finances




If Your Time is short





State revenues fell no matter how you look at it. The depth of the decline varies depending on the time period examined.


From March through December 2020, aggregate state revenues dropped 1.6% from the same period a year earlier.


For the full year, overall state revenues fell 0.12%. California was an outlier, with tax receipts rising 3.5%, while Florida saw a drop of 7.9% and Texas a drop of 6.8%.


Cities and counties saw larger revenue declines than states.





See the sources for this fact-check




A fundamental disagreement over the latest COVID-19 relief plan centers on aid to states, cities and counties. Democrats plan to include about $350 billion in aid, and Republicans argue that not only is the money unnecessary, it’s just a way to reward to liberal states.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said Democrats are lying about the need.
""States across the country are seeing increases in revenue — in some cases, well above projections,"" Scott said in a Feb. 1 statement. ""Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12% compared to 2019, and 21 of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.""
Is the revenue picture as rosy as Scott makes it out to be?
One study partially backs up Scott’s numbers, but he made some errors. Other compilations of state financial reports show the situation is worse than he presents. And if it weren’t for one state — California — the numbers would look even more dire.
Scott’s own state, Florida, was among the biggest revenue losers.
A bank’s view
Scott’s staff pointed to a J.P. Morgan weekly market report. The investment bank’s analysts aimed to give bond investors a sense of the ability of states to repay bonds. Scott drew on that work virtually word for word. 
He accurately reflected the findings that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019, and 21 of 47 states show positive year-over-year growth in tax receipts. (The study had a full-year of data on 37 states, and 11 months for another 10.)
But Scott proceeded to muddle the numbers. After noting that revenues rose in 21 states, he then said ""over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York and Illinois."" Clearly, 21 is fewer than half of the 50 states.
The first statistic he cited in his claim — 21 — relates to total tax revenues. The second — half of states — relates to personal income taxes alone. Scott failed to note the difference.
The J.P. Morgan report said personal income tax revenues rose in over half of the states where it had data, including the three states Scott named. But in terms of total revenues, only California saw its numbers go up. New York was down 1.5% and Illinois was down 0.9%. 
Half a dozen states suffered far deeper revenue drops. The worst hit include Nevada (-13%), North Dakota (-9.7%), Florida (-7.9%), Texas (-6.8%), West Virginia (-6.8%) and Oklahoma (-6.7%). 
The J.P. Morgan report’s time frame bears a mention. It includes two full months in 2020 before the coronavirus cratered the economy. Other research gives a window into the virus’ fiscal impact in the pandemic months between March and December.
The COVID-19 impact, and the California effect
Based on budget reports from 46 states, researcher Lucy Dadayan at the Urban Institute, an academic center in Washington, D.C., told us that from March through December, revenues from personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes fell by 1.6% from the same period a year earlier.
That decline might seem small, but it is more than 10 times larger than the 0.12% Scott referred to.
In raw dollars, it represents $12.6 billion in lost revenue.
Aggregate numbers conceal as much as they reveal, and California was an outlier with a hefty effect on the overall numbers. Thanks to a variety of factors, including large year-end bonuses and massive tax withholding tied to initial stock offerings of companies like Airbnb, California’s revenues shot up 26.5% in December alone. That was enough to make the national picture look considerably better.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""












By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







When Dadayan pulled the Golden State out of the equation, total revenues across the remaining states were down 2%. That’s 25% worse than when California was included.
There are other ways to measure the fiscal impact of COVID-19.
The National Association of State Budget Officers gets information from all 50 states, but those numbers are for fiscal, not calendar, years. In most cases, that runs from July through June.
The time frame is different, but the numbers are similar to Dadayan’s figures.
In their fiscal years that ended in 2020, states collected $14 billion less than the year before. And in their budgets for fiscal year 2021, states factored in an additional decline of $39 billion, for a total reduction of $53 billion over the two years.
Dadayan said that before the coronavirus, accounting for population and economic growth, states had planned on a rise of about 5% in revenues each year. The National Association of State Budget Officers said that compared with those pre-COVID-19 budget forecasts, revenues will be down by $135 billion.
To help close part of the gap, states drew down their emergency funds by $12.2 billion.
Looking beyond state revenues
Scott’s focus on how much money states are collecting leaves out half the fiscal picture — the spending side. In the face of falling revenues, states cut spending on schools, roads and many other areas. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported that education spending fell by $7.4 billion. Another $5.6 billion came from a range of programs, including public safety, the judiciary, environmental protection and aid to local governments.
Modest declines in state revenue can have more pronounced effects on county and city budgets that rely on state aid. The Democratic plan that Scott criticized would also send aid to cities and counties. 
A survey of county officials during the summer found most counties were seeing budget shortfalls, and nearly three-quarters of them were holding back on capital spending and county services.
The National League of Cities reported that overall city revenues have fallen 21% since the start of the pandemic, while expenses have risen 17%.
Chicago alone reported a nearly $800 million general fund deficit at the end of August.
Dadayan said the focus on state revenues ""misses the fiscal stress on local governments, which is a lot bigger compared to state revenue shortfalls.""
She added that cities are looking at budget gaps estimated at more than $90 billion.
Our ruling
Scott said states across the country are seeing increases in revenue with an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019. He also said that over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.
Scott faithfully reflects a report from J.P. Morgan in terms of the 0.12% overall decline, but he went astray when talking about states with higher revenues, particularly the three states he named. The J.P. Morgan report said revenues grew only in California. They fell in New York and Illinois.
Scott’s numbers included two months before the pandemic began. Focusing on the pandemic months of March through December, revenues fell about 10 times more than Scott said.
He also limited his view of fiscal health to state revenues. Factoring in spending cuts, and impacts on city and county finances, the picture is much worse.
Scott used a report that gave a limited view of a broader fiscal landscape, and misread an element in the report itself. The information he left out would leave a reader with a different impression.

Joe Kernen","CNBC’s Joe Kernen wrong about US per capita COVID-19 deaths




If Your Time is short





Recent data from Johns Hopkins University shows the U.S. has had approximately 30 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people. Kernen got that basically right.


But only a handful of countries are performing worse by that metric, and even fewer — three — have recorded more than 60 deaths per 100,000 people.


Various databases show the U.S. has more COVID-19 deaths per capita than the vast majority of countries. 





See the sources for this fact-check




On the day the U.S. topped 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, CNBC hosts Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin shouted over each other about the threat of the virus and its impact on the stock market.
After Kernen said Sorkin had panicked about the coronavirus and spooked investors, Sorkin accused Kernen of dismissing the virus as a way to defend President Donald Trump.
""You didn’t panic about anything,"" Sorkin said during the May 27 dust-up on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box."" ""100,000 people died, Joe, and all you did was try to help your friend, the president.""
Kernen responded that he has been trying to help investors ""keep their cool, keep their heads,"" adding that ""as it turned out, that’s what they should’ve done."" Then he explained why.
""We’re down near the low end of per capita deaths,"" Kernen said. ""… Most places are at 60 deaths per 100,000. We're at 29.""
The next day, the two told viewers that they had made amends, with Sorkin saying they were ""having the conversation that’s happening at everybody’s dinner table.""
In case you’re having the same argument over dinner tonight, we wanted to arm you with the facts: Kernen’s claim on deaths per capita isn’t completely accurate.
While the U.S. is close to 29 deaths per 100,000 people, it is not ""near the low end of per capita deaths,"" we found. Only a handful of countries have had more deaths per capita.
RELATED: Trump’s comparison of COVID-19 deaths in Germany, US is wrong
The numbers
A CNBC spokesperson cited data from Johns Hopkins University tracking deaths per 100,000 people, a metric that public health experts generally consider useful.
As of May 26, the day before Kernen’s claim, the U.S. had recorded 30.23 deaths per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins. 
That was better than 10 countries. It was worse than more than 130 others, including many nations of similar size.
Specifically, the U.S. had more deaths per 100,000 people at the time of Kernen’s comment than all but a handful of European countries: San Marino, Belgium, Andorra, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland.

Only San Marino (pop. 34,000), Belgium (pop. 11.6 million) and Andorra (pop. 77,000) had more than 60 deaths per 100,000 people. Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy had over 50 deaths per 100,000.
Those figures have hardly changed as of May 27. The U.S. is at 30.69 deaths per 100,000 people, behind the same 10 European nations but ahead of the rest. 
Three other sources public health experts told us are reliable — the Kaiser Family Foundation, Our World in Data and Worldometer — show similar numbers. 
Each source shows the U.S. performing worse than the vast majority of countries.
""We have a very high death rate here compared to most countries in the world, and some of our states have among the highest death rates in the world,"" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University.
The U.S., in particular, is ""a patchwork epidemic"" because of its ""expansive, diverse geography and populations,"" Nichols said. 
Different geographic areas experience varying outbreaks and death tolls due to a number of factors, such as the age of the population, how far along the epidemic curve the area is and how well the local health care systems have been able to manage, she said.
If you compare individual U.S. states to other countries, Nichols said, the situation looks worse. Eleven states plus Washington, D.C have more deaths per million people than the U.S. as a whole, according to Worldometer data for May 28. 
Some states are comparable to the worst countries.
As we’ve noted, another way to compare countries is to consider recent — rather than total — death counts per capita. But as of May 28, numerous countries have also had fewer daily deaths per capita based on a seven-day average than the U.S., per Our World in Data.
Our ruling
Kernen said: ""We’re down near the low end of per capita deaths … Most places are at 60 deaths per 100,000. We're at 29.""
The U.S. has hovered slightly above 29 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in recent days, but it is far from being ""down near the low end of per capita deaths."" 
Only a handful of countries are performing worse by that metric, and just three have recorded more than 60 deaths per 100,000.

See the sources for this fact-check




Wisconsin’s beleaguered unemployment system is the latest battleground in the ongoing showdown between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican-run Legislature.
The system continues to stagger beneath the weight of pandemic-driven job losses, with thousands of Wisconsinites forced to wait months for benefits to be processed. Evers and his administration have drawn widespread criticism for the system, which also spurred the governor to effectively fire the head of the state’s workforce development agency.
Evers has also leveled blame at Republicans, noting no substantive action was taken to upgrade a system long known to be insufficient during the eight-year stretch where the GOP controlled both the Legislature and governor’s mansion.
The governor tried to push the issue forward with a special session on unemployment Jan. 19, but the Legislature convened and adjourned the session within seconds — as they have many other sessions Evers has called in an attempt to initiate action in one of the least active Legislatures in the country.
Republicans have said such a step isn’t needed.
""It took us all of five minutes to understand that (Evers) has the authority and the revenue necessary to complete this task now,"" Assembly Majority Leaders Jim Steineke said in a Jan. 17, 2021, appearance on WKOW TV’s Capitol City Sunday program. ""He doesn’t need legislative approval. So if he’s just looking for us to put a stamp of approval on, hey governor, you got it, go ahead. The Legislature agrees with you, move forward. You don’t have to wait for us to pass it.""
Steineke later said Evers ""has all the flexibility to find the money necessary to complete what he wants to complete on this.""
Are Steineke and Republicans right that Evers has both the authority and revenue to address the unemployment system on his own?
Let’s take a closer look.
The background
The task being debated here isn’t a small one.
Evers’ office has estimated an overhaul of the state’s unemployment system would take 10 years to complete and cost $90 million. A Jan. 13, 2021, memo from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the cost at between $48 million and $70 million.
This comes as the unemployment system continues to see claims far above historical norms, fueling continued delays in processing payments.

This will be the second attempt at such an upgrade, after an effort under Gov. Jim Doyle failed at great taxpayer expense. That unemployment system update was abandoned in 2007 after racking up a tab of $24 million.
The Doyle project was funded by technology fees and one-time federal funds, but neither of those is available now. So Evers has said he plans to fund this upgrade through the state’s master lease program.
The program, which dates back to 1991, is a way for agencies to finance the cost of IT projects over a number of years when projects are too large to allow lump-sum payment. From 2014 to 2020, $142 million was approved through this program for 28 different IT projects across state government, according to a September 2020 report on the master lease program from the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau.
State agencies can apply for this funding through the state Department of Administration, which decides whether to approve the applications and then obtains the necessary loans. The Legislature is not involved in the approval process, but it is involved in setting aside money that is used to make those lease payments.
More on that in a bit.
On Evers’ authority and revenue access
Steineke spokeswoman Alesha Emmert said Evers has the authority to begin the upgrade process by issuing a request for proposal, as his administration has done with many other upgrades without legislative approval.
Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Evers, acknowledged the governor has the authority to start the process, but she argued it’s irrelevant without ongoing funding.
""Funding a (request for proposal) … is meaningless if there’s no commitment from the Legislature to fund the rest of the project,"" Cudaback said in an email. ""Given the substantial cost for the overall project of $90 million, (Evers’) goal is to ensure funds will be there for the master lease payments in future biennia.""

Mark Born


stated on June 2, 2021 in Twitter








“Before the pandemic, just over 40,000 were on continuing UI claims. Now, there are well over 100,000 on state or federal UI benefits.”












By D.L. Davis • June 18, 2021







Addressing the revenue question, the only specific funding source Emmert identified is a procurement appropriations fund overseen by the Department of Administration that had a $4 million balance at the end of the 2020 fiscal year. But that is far from sufficient in the context of a project that could cost $90 million. And even that fund isn’t accessible, as Emmert asserts.
The funds are allocated to the Department of Administration to fund its role procuring items for agencies, not for transferring to other agencies to directly fund purchases, Cudaback said. In addition, the balance is projected to be only $2 million by the end of the 2021 fiscal year.
Most notably, that fund was not listed among the potential funding sources in a list compiled by the fiscal bureau. State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, asked the agency to identify potential ways to pay for the unemployment upgrades.
The resulting memo identified nine funding sources that could be allowable under statute. Seven of those had a balance of $25,000 or less, one had a liability of $85 million and one had a balance around $15 million. That fund, per statute, is to be used for the ""payment of costs associated with program integrity activities,"" and is currently used for fraud investigation, worker classification enforcement, identify verification and criminal prosecutions, among other things.
Even if the entirety of that investigation fund were co-opted from its current use, it would fund just a fraction of expected cost.
The Legislature’s role
Whatever the mechanism, it’s clear funds will need to be set aside across multiple years. And the way to approve such ongoing funding is through the budget — which must pass the Legislature.
The fiscal bureau memo pointed out the need for legislative involvement in the project. In response to a question about whether the Joint Finance Committee could move appropriations from another agency to fund the first payments toward the upgrade (it can), the memo noted this:
""If the Committee (did the transfer), it would be incumbent on the Legislature during the budget process to approve monies in subsequent biennia sufficient to fulfill the annual master lease costs over its term.""
That Legislative role was echoed in the 2020 audit. It suggested the Legislature consider getting involved in the master lease approval process since it is responsible for appropriating the needed money.
""Master lease payments must be made from funds that have been appropriated to state agencies,"" the audit said. ""Therefore, the Legislature could consider modifying statutes to require (the Department of Administration) to obtain its approval before approving applications for master lease funding above a specified amount or for specified projects, such as large, high-risk IT projects.""
Steineke’s claim about Evers’ power is particularly unusual since it contradicts his party’s usual view on financial oversight. 
Republicans argued explicitly against the idea of Evers allocating funding unilaterally in recent days. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos addressed the matter while defending a COVID-19 bill that would give the Republican-controlled finance committee oversight of how federal aid is spent in Wisconsin.
""It’s not something that’s all that abnormal,"" Vos, R-Rochester, said on PBS Wisconsin’s Here & Now program Jan. 29, 2021. ""It should mean the Legislature, the ones that are supposed to appropriate money, have the ability to oversee it just like we do with every other dollar that comes into the state treasury.""
Our ruling
Steineke said Evers ""has the authority and revenue necessary"" to upgrade the state unemployment system without the Legislature.
Evers has the authority and funding to begin the process by seeking out proposals, yes. But it’s an empty authority when  no sources under Evers’ control that come close to funding the full project were known at the time of this claim.
Steineke’s claim related to revenue simply isn’t true. Both sides acknowledge a master lease would be a logical way forward, and that requires ongoing funding over the course of multiple state budgets — which has to be approved by the Legislature.
We define Mostly False as a statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
That fits here. 
 
Editor’s note:
After Steineke made his statement, a new potential funding option emerged based on a long-unused section of state statute. A state law dating back to at least the 1940s — and unused anytime in recent history — would allow the state to impose a tax of up to 0.2% on all employer payrolls to collect funds needed to administer the state unemployment insurance program. This could be done without any legislative action and theoretically generate more than $60 million per year at its maximum level.
However, the existence of this option was not publicly known when Steineke made his claim, and therefore was not part of his claim or the supporting evidence provided by his staff. The state Department of Workforce Development raised this as an option at a Jan. 21 meeting, four days after the statement being rated here. We rate claims based on what is known at the time (that’s one of the Principles of PolitiFact). As such, that does not affect the rating for this item.
The story was also updated to clarify that the Wisconsin unemployment system did undergo some upgrades over the last decades, just nothing of substance to address the issues that came to a head amid the pandemic.","Capital City Sunday: Securing the Capitol, corporate donations cut off, ongoing COVID bill stalemate",https://wkow.com/2021/01/17/capital-city-sunday-securing-the-capitol-corporate-donations-cut-off-ongoing-covid-bill-stalemate/,null,,null,

Laura Ingraham","Fact-checking Laura Ingraham’s claim about immigrants staying in hotels




If Your Time is short





Some asylum seekers released by immigration officials in San Diego have been quarantining in a hotel to comply with the state’s pandemic rules. Jewish Family Service of San Diego, a local nonprofit, has been helping them do so.


The migrants have been cleared to stay in the country while they wait for their chance to present their cases in court, a Jewish Family Service representative told PolitiFact.


In general, any immigrants who are physically present in the United States or who arrive in the U.S. can seek asylum, even if they were not legally admitted into the country.





See the sources for this fact-check




As former President Donald Trump was tried in the Senate for inciting an insurrection, Fox News host Laura Ingraham accused Democrats of plotting their own insurrection by ""enticing illegals to bust through our borders, exploit our resources and commit crimes.""
Ingraham said immigrants were exploiting American hospitality. ""You may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegals arriving since Biden’s inauguration, they get to stay free of charge,"" Ingraham said Feb. 8, citing a report in the New York Times.
""It sounds so pleasant. Can you believe that? At a time when our own people are suffering,"" Ingraham said, after reading a snippet from the report.

As part of a story about an influx of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, the New York Times reported that some migrants arriving in San Diego were quarantining in a hotel in order to comply with California’s 10-day quarantine requirement for out-of-state travelers.
""To guard against the coronavirus, health authorities in San Diego have arranged housing for hundreds of arriving migrants in a downtown high-rise hotel, where they are being quarantined before being allowed to join family or friends in the interior of the United States,"" the newspaper found.
A clip from Ingraham’s monologue was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So PolitiFact decided to put her claim about ""illegals"" at hotels to the Truth-O-Meter.
We spoke with immigration experts and Jewish Family Service of San Diego, the nonprofit social-services agency that’s helping families through their hotel quarantines in San Diego. 
It’s true that arriving migrants are quarantining in a hotel in at least that one location, they said.
But they said Ingraham was wrong to characterize the public health measure as an amenity for ""illegals."" It involves migrants who were let into the U.S. to seek asylum.
""The hotel stay is not a vacation,"" said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago. ""It is designed as a public health measure to protect the entire community.""
Eitan Peled, a border services advocate with Jewish Family Service, said the migrants quarantining at the hotel include some who came through ports of entry and some who were apprehended after entering the country unlawfully. 
""Every one of these migrants is asserting their legal right to seek international protection in the United States,"" Peled said.
What’s happening in San Diego
The hotel-quarantine setup in San Diego was covered in the New York Times’ report, and also by KSWB-TV, a Fox affiliate in San Diego, and the San Diego Union-Tribune. 
KSWB-TV reported Feb. 9 that the migrants in question ""have been allowed to remain in the U.S. after asking for asylum"" and were turned over to Jewish Family Service.
Immigrants who are physically present in the U.S. can seek asylum regardless of whether they are in the country legally or illegally, as PolitiFact has reported. They generally have to apply for asylum within one year of arriving in the U.S. For that reason, immigration experts took issue with Ingraham’s characterization of the migrants in San Diego’s hotel as ""illegals.""

""A person can seek asylum at a port of entry to the United States or within the interior of the United States,"" said Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School. ""If a person crossed the border without inspection, that person was not ‘admitted’ into the United States, but that does not make the person ‘illegal.’""
In San Diego, the immigrants quarantining in a hotel are those who have been released by immigration officials while they wait to present their case in an immigration court, Peled said. 
They have ""passed a credible fear interview conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, and are now awaiting their asylum cases in the U.S.,"" he said.
When immigrants claim asylum, they are processed and either detained or released to friends or family who promise that they will appear at future court hearings, Hallett said. But getting people to their sponsors can be tricky in a pandemic, when travel is restricted.
""Thus, the government releases people to a local nonprofit that assists with the quarantine and then ensures that they arrive at their final destination,"" Hallett said. ""It appears that Jewish Family Service is playing this role in San Diego.""
Peled said JFS is helping families through their quarantines by providing case management as well as financial and travel assistance. He said the effort is part of San Diego County’s ability to access federal funding for reimbursement of ""non-congregate sheltering"" — that is, temporary living arrangements that avoid crowding to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.
A spokesperson for the Border Patrol in the San Diego sector told the San Diego Union-Tribune that COVID-19 restrictions have caused some facilities to reach ""maximum safe holding capacity,"" prompting the release of some migrants before their court hearings.
The practice of releasing immigrants until they appear before a judge was less common under Trump, Barbato said. The Trump administration starting in 2019 forced migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases moved through the immigration system. 
It isn’t clear how many places are using hotels like San Diego. The Associated Press reported that a Texas charity was testing migrants released by the Border Patrol for COVID-19 and sending those with infections to isolate in a hotel.
A Fox News spokesperson cited the transcript from Ingraham’s show, where she referred specifically to what was happening in San Diego after first mentioning the hotel quarantines. 
But Ingraham’s broader claim that ""illegals … get to stay free of charge"" could have given some viewers the impression that President Joe Biden’s policy was opening up free hotel rooms along the border to immigrants who were in the country unlawfully.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Feb. 10 that the ""vast majority have been turned away.""
Our ruling
In the video clip, Ingraham said, ""You may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegals arriving since Biden’s inauguration, they get to stay free of charge."" 
Ingraham’s sweeping comment exaggerated the facts.
In San Diego, under an arrangement with local health authorities and a local nonprofit, migrants seeking asylum have been quarantining in a hotel before traveling elsewhere to await their court cases. 
These migrants have been cleared by federal authorities to be in the country while they pursue their asylum claims, even if some entered unlawfully. Their hotel stays are part of public health measures to help contain the spread of COVID-19.
Ingraham’s claim contains an element of truth but gives a misleading impression by omitting important context about the circumstances of their hotel stays.

Facebook posts","Facebook post exaggerates seasonal flu deaths for last year




If Your Time is short





The CDC’s estimate for seasonal flu deaths for the 2017-18 season was about 61,000.


The CDC’s preliminary estimate for seasonal flu deaths for the 2018-19 season is about 34,200, but that’s not the final number.





See the sources for this fact-check




With a climbing death toll from COVID-19 grabbing daily headlines, some social media users have noted that the seasonal flu kills tens of thousands per year, too.
But an April 18 Facebook post exaggerates seasonal flu fatalities: 
""Flu killed 80k people in the U.S. last year. None of you were afraid because the media didn’t tell you to be!"" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The post appears to rely on a number used as a preliminary estimate for the 2017-18 flu season. The final figure for that year was lower than 80,000. And while the number of people who died from flu during the 2018-19 season is still preliminary, it is estimated to be less than half of what the Facebook post claims as well.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a mathematical model to retroactively estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States each year. The CDC first looks at in-hospital deaths and then uses death certificate data since not all flu deaths are in the hospital.
That 80,000 figure stems from a preliminary estimate provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September 2018. At that time, the CDC said early estimates indicated that ""more than 80,000 people died from flu last season"" — a reference to the 2017-18 flu season.
The CDC later updated its estimate for 2017-18 to about 61,000 (though the CDC notes that the true range could be as low as 46,404 and as high as 94,987).

Vegan Instagram users are pinning the 2019 coronavirus outbreak on carnivores.
In a post published March 15, the account for ""Cowspiracy,"" a film about the environmental impact of meat production, claimed that COVID-19 started ""because we eat animals.""
""COVID-19 would not exist if the world was vegan,"" reads the image.

Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, which had infected more than 179,000 people worldwide as of March 17, we saw a lot of baseless claims pinning the disease on the consumption of bats in China. Cowspiracy’s Instagram post piggybacks on that misinformation.
As evidence, it refers to the Instagram account for Ed Winters, a vegan activist based in the United Kingdom. His March 14 post cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to back up his claim about meat consumption causing the COVID-19 outbreak.
On its website, the CDC says that ""3 out of every 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals."" And the WHO has said that eating ""raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat"" carries a potential risk for infection from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another human coronavirus.
But neither statement supports the link that the activist draws between COVID-19 and meat-eating. Scientists are still trying to figure out the source of COVID-19, but there is no evidence that the outbreak began because of meat consumption.

According to the CDC, COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus similar to MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). All three originate in bats, and the recent COVID-19 outbreak suggests a ""likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.""
Early in the outbreak, many patients in the virus epicenter of Wuhan, China, had connections to a large seafood and live-animal market, which suggested animal-to-person spread. But later cases had no connection to the market, suggesting person-to-person spread. Scientists recently traced the first known case of COVID-19 to November 2019, in a patient with no connection to the market.
RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic
There’s plenty of scientific literature linking human coronaviruses to bats and other wild animals, particularly horseshoe bats in China. However, those studies stipulate that ""intermediate hosts"" are needed between bats and humans for the disease to spread — and meat isn’t necessarily part of the equation.
For example, scientists first thought the Ebola outbreak started with the consumption of bat meat in Guinea. But Time reported that patient zero was likely infected by bat droppings that contaminated something she put in her mouth. MERS was also primarily spread through contact with live camels as opposed to camel meat.
One of the first studies published about COVID-19 by Chinese researchers found that the virus could come from the same bats that were the source of the 2003 SARS outbreak. But the researchers cautioned that it’s ""likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans.""
More recent studies of COVID-19 suggest that pangolins, scaly anteaters, could be that intermediate host. The animals are sought-after in China for their meat and scales, despite a worldwide ban.
However, scientists have yet to find conclusive proof that pangolins are to blame for the coronavirus. And as of now, there is no evidence that eating meat is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The screenshot is missing critical context: Capitol police had instructed Jayapal and other lawmakers to take off their masks in order to prepare to put on gas masks.


Jayapal tested positive for COVID-19 days after the Capitol riot. She blamed Republican lawmakers who had refused to wear masks in a secured indoor location that day.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., blamed her Republican colleagues after she and two other House Democrats tested positive for COVID-19 in the days following the U.S. Capitol mob, which forced lawmakers into close quarters as they took shelter from the violence.
""I just received a positive COVID-19 test result after being locked down in a secured room at the Capitol where several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one,"" Jayapal wrote in a Jan. 12 tweet.
Several Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has supported the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, were seen on video refusing to wear masks while members of both chambers waited out the siege from the secured room.
But some social media users say photo and video evidence shows that Jayapal also didn’t wear a mask as the rioters breached the building and halted congressional proceedings.

""We were then under siege,"" Jayapal said, explaining that she was trapped in the gallery with about 12 other lawmakers. ""The Capitol police told us at that point to get off of our chairs, to get on the floor, to take off our masks, and to actually be ready to put on our gas masks. So if you look at those pictures, I am holding in my right hand a gas mask.""
""We were specifically told to take off our masks, because you can’t breathe within the gas mask if you have the other mask on,"" she continued. ""So all of us had been wearing masks. We took off our masks. We held our gas masks. And we were down on the floor.""
The full video footage from which the photograph was captured supports Jayapal’s explanation. As Snopes reported, the video shows Jayapal with her gas mask in hand. The video shows another person, seated on the floor a row above Jayapal, with the gas mask already on.

""You can see the gas mask in her right hand in the photo,"" said Jayapal spokesperson Chris Evans. Evans said Jayapal tested negative for COVID-19 on Jan. 5, a day before the Capitol siege.

While some countries have started to use vaccination certificates, they are not required everywhere. 


The World Health Organization has advised countries not to require COVID-19 vaccination for travel.


Anyone can download and use the WHO vaccination record pictured in the TikTok video. International health regulations for travelers require inoculations only against yellow fever.

A popular TikTok video said that if you want to travel abroad after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, you’ll need a passport. But not just any passport.
""You will need a WHO Yellow Vaccination Passport if you plan on traveling internationally once borders open,"" says the caption on a March 17 post.
The video, which had more than 80,000 shares before it was removed, featured a TikTok user who said he works at ""an international airline."" He said cards issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Americans who receive the coronavirus vaccine aren’t sufficient to gain entry into other countries.
""They’re not cutting it, because they’re easily forgeable and they’re administered by the CDC, which is an American organization that other countries don’t necessarily recognize,"" the user said in the video. ""What is recognized by every country in the world are documents that are administered by the World Health Organization.""
Nearly a quarter of Americans have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, and President Joe Biden has said that at the current pace, the country could return to some degree of normalcy by July 4. So we wanted to take a closer look at the TikTok post’s claim about proof of vaccination for travelers.

(Screenshot from TikTok)
The video is wrong — COVID-19 vaccination is not required to travel abroad. While some countries have started to check for proof of vaccination for travelers to avoid quarantine and testing requirements, the documents are not required as a condition of travel, and the WHO has advocated against requiring vaccination before travel.
In the video, the TikTok user held up a yellow document. He said the WHO sells the vaccination passport on its website, and that ""you will need a doctor to sign and stamp this in order to make it valid"" 
The yellow document is the WHO’s International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, which was created following the passage of the International Health Regulations in 2005. The passport-size vaccination record includes pages that ""must be signed in the hand of the clinician … supervising the administration of the vaccine or prophylaxis."" You can download and print one free online.
The document is not directly related to COVID-19.

""Under the current legal provisions in the International Health Regulations (2005), yellow fever is the only disease for which proof of vaccination is a prerequisite for entry,"" a WHO spokesperson told PolitiFact.
In February, the WHO published a position paper that said countries should not begin requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for departure or entry, ""given that there are still critical unknowns regarding the efficacy of vaccination in reducing transmission.""
""In addition, considering that there is limited availability of vaccines, preferential vaccination of travelers could result in inadequate supplies of vaccines for priority populations considered at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease,"" the WHO wrote.
That recommendation is nonbinding, though, and some countries have started to implement their own COVID-19 vaccination policies for travel. Iceland, for example, has started allowing entry to passengers with proof of vaccination such as a WHO certificate. Without it, travelers would have to test negative for COVID-19. 
Several other countries have similar policies. Sweden and Denmark are working on creating their own digital vaccination certificates, and Israel has issued its ""green pass"" to vaccinated citizens who want to access public amenities. (Consult the State Department’s website for a full list of country-level COVID-19 travel restrictions.)

Donald Trump","Fact-checking whether Biden called Trump ‘xenophobic’ for restrictions on travel from China




If Your Time is short





Biden has not directly said that the restrictions were xenophobic. 


Around the time the Trump administration announced the travel restriction,  Biden said that Trump had a “record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.” 


Biden used the phrase “xenophobic” in reply to a Trump tweet about limiting entry to travelers from China and in which Trump described the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.” Biden did not spell out which part of Trump’s tweet was xenophobic.





See the sources for this fact-check




Amid criticism of his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump routinely flags one action as efficient and bold: restricting travel from China into the United States.
Trump has said he instituted a travel ban against everyone’s wishes and that ""nobody,"" not even doctors, wanted him to restrict travel. But ""probably tens of thousands"" of people would be dead now if he hadn’t done so, he claimed on Fox News March 24.
At the same time, he’s claimed that former Vice President Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic nomination for president, called him racist and xenophobic for restricting entry from China.
""I had Biden calling me xenophobic,"" Trump said on Sean Hannity’s Fox News prime-time show March 26. ""He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.""
Trump has said that about Biden at least three other times — on Twitter, at a White House briefing, and during the Fox News town hall.
But Biden has not directly said that the travel restriction was xenophobic. He has used that phrase in reference to Trump and his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact that Biden’s tweets were not specific to the restrictions on people coming from China.
Biden’s use of the word ""xenophobic""
The White House press office said Trump’s claim is supported by a tweet Biden posted Feb. 1, the day after the Trump administration announced travel restrictions on people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the United States.
Biden tweeted: ""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.""
But Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.
Biden said: ""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.""

Biden again used the word ""xenophobic"" in March — once at a press conference and once in response to a Trump tweet. In the first, Biden was criticizing Trump for labeling coronavirus a ""foreign"" virus. In the second, it’s not clear whether Biden’s use of the word was in direct reference to the travel restriction.
During a March 12 press conference Biden said, the United States should not be overly dismissive of the outbreak, ""but neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia, labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.""
Earlier that day, the Trump campaign tweeted that Democrats and news outlets were ""accusing President Trump of racism and xenophobia"" for his use of the phrase ""Chinese virus.""
On March 18, Trump tweeted: ""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!""
Biden replied the same day: ""Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job.""
 
The tweet that Biden responded to included the phrase ""Chinese virus,"" which experts say could foster discrimination toward people of Chinese or Asian origin.
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Biden ""has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak. This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions.""
Travel restrictions that are supported by science, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy can be warranted, Bates said.
Our ruling
Speaking of his restriction on travel from China, Trump said, ""I had Biden calling me xenophobic. … . He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.""
Biden has not directly said that the restrictions were xenophobic. Around the time the Trump administration announced the travel restriction, Biden said that Trump had a ""record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering."" Biden used the phrase ""xenophobic"" in reply to a Trump tweet about limiting entry to travelers from China and in which he described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus."" Biden did not spell out which part of Trump’s tweet was xenophobic.

Ron Klain","Trump vaccine plan left logistics to states, but it did exist




If Your Time is short





The Trump administration planned to get the vaccines developed and then send them to locations chosen by states. States wrote their own plans, and they were responsible for setting up places to get vaccines into Americans’ arms.


The Trump administration’s approach was flawed, experts said, because it failed to adequately communicate about the anticipated number of doses and the rollout.


The Biden administration plans more federal involvement in getting vaccines into arms, including setting up 100 FEMA sites nationwide.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Joe Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain criticized the Trump administration’s vaccination campaign as ""chaotic,"" adding Biden will work more closely with states to get vaccines into arms.
On Meet the Press, Chuck Todd asked Klain about conflicting comments by Biden officials about whether the new administration had to create a vaccination distribution plan from scratch. 
Klain said Biden was building on progress from the initial wave of vaccinations, ""no question about it.""
""But the process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole did not really exist when we came into the White House,"" Klain said.
Really? We found that’s taking things too far.
Many experts said that the Trump administration’s plan had some key holes, including a failure to communicate with the states and cities about the rollout and inadequate funding for vaccine distribution. But it did have a plan: rely on the states.
""The federal plan, much like the rest of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, was very hands off when it comes to details of implementing public health interventions,"" said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The last mile of vaccine delivery was not a big part of the federal plan by design.""
Trump administration’s plan relied on the states 
We asked Michael R. Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, if the Trump administration had a plan for vaccine distribution.
""It is all in what you mean by ‘plan,"" Fraser said. ""If you mean a tactical guidebook on how to do vaccination from A to Z, no, there is no federal plan."" 
Prakash Nagarkatti, vice president for research at the University of South Carolina, told USA Today that ""there was total lack of planning at the state level for mass vaccination, and the federal government did not help the states overcome the hurdles.""
In September, the Trump administration announced a general strategy to distribute the vaccine which included deliveries to states and, later, pharmacy chains. A partnership with CVS and Walgreens administered vaccines in some long-term care facilities. 
The closest thing to a federal plan was the playbook the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave states to help them create their own distribution plans.
States wrote broad plans and submitted them in October. They lacked important details , such as how many doses they would get and when. (At the time, no vaccines were approved.)
Without dollars to make them happen, state plans were essentially wish lists, Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, said on a podcast. It wasn’t until December that Congress approved a COVID-19 package with $8 billion for vaccine distribution.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







At the same time, it’s clear there was some level of coordination. The U.S. would not have been able to give shots to millions of people, enroll tens of thousands of private providers, and set up a data collection system tying in all 50 states if the federal and state governments had done no planning.
""To say there wasn’t planning is not accurate,"" Hannan told PolitiFact. ""However, I don’t think there was communication from the federal government about the plan, about the vision, about how things would work.""
Biden’s plan calls for more federal involvement
A couple of days after Klain’s interview, Biden offered a softened take on the work of the Trump administration.
""We want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere … for getting the program off the ground,"" Biden said Jan. 26. ""And that credit is absolutely due.""
But Biden said that once he took office, he found that the vaccine program was in worse shape than he expected. 
The Biden administration has envisioned a more prominent federal role, including setting up  100 vaccine centers across the nation by the end of February. Officials say the biggest roadblock is lack of vaccine supply. Biden announced that his administration aims to purchase enough doses to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer or beginning of the fall.
While the philosophical approach to federal involvement is different, ""you can’t say absence of plan when the plan isn't the one you would have created,"" said KFF’s Michaud.
The Washington Post reported that Biden’s advisers inherited something ""more like a black box than a bare cupboard — the result of fractured communication among federal, state and local officials and a juggling act between manufacturers making a new product and thousands of providers, from big hospital systems to tiny clinics, struggling to plan around an unknown amount of vaccine.""
As of Jan. 26, about 20 million people had received their first dose and about 3.5 million had received a second dose, according to the CDC. About 44 million doses had been distributed.
The main challenge that states now face is they only know how many doses they are getting a few days in advance. Most state officials have said they could deliver double or triple the number of shots if they had a larger supply.
""The story here is the supply, not needing a plan,"" Fraser said.
Our ruling
Klain said, ""The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House.""
Klain was focusing his criticism on the phase of getting vaccinations into the arms of the general public, not the initial phase of vaccinating health care workers and workers and residents of long-term care facilities.
The Trump administration’s approach to distributing the vaccine was to give it to locations chosen by the states and to let them take it from there. There are many criticisms of this process, including that it took too long to give states money to implement their plans and a lack of communication from the top about how the rollout would work. But that was the plan they drew up.
Saying there a plan ""does not really exist"" is beyond saying a plan is lacking. We rate Klain’s claim Mostly False.

Marco Rubio","Did China halt exports of face masks to US?




If Your Time is short





All imports from China fell during January and February 2020, compared with a year earlier, but did not disappear entirely.


The federal government as well as a few states have imported medical supplies from China during the COVID-19 pandemic.


U.S. imports of certain medical supplies from China fell in 2019 when the Trump administration raised tariffs on these goods.





See the sources for this fact-check




Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., casts some blame on China for the U.S. struggle to obtain crucial medical supplies amid COVID-19.
Writing in the New York Times, Rubio accused China of using the world’s supply chain of medical gear to benefit itself during the coronavirus outbreak:
""Having monopolized those critical supply chains, the Chinese Communist Party pointed them inward. It ensured that face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus. Largely unable to import supplies from China, America has been left scrambling because we by and large lack the ability to make things, as well as the state capacity needed for reorienting production to do so. As a result, doctors are forced to ration supplies and, in some cases, cease using necessary protective equipment.""
There are clear problems in the U.S. medical supply chain. A mad dash for masks and other supplies has created logistical hurdles and frenzied dealmaking in the global market, including in China. 
And Rubio’s concerns about the U.S. relying on China for supplies are not new. He raised them more than a year ago.
""Although American pharmaceutical firms face short-term commercial opportunities in China, the U.S. runs the risk of losing important components of its medical supply chain to China’s government-backed industry,"" Rubio wrote in a report in February 2019.
But in his op-ed, Rubio overstates the problem with Chinese imports and ignores some key factors — including that imports were declining before COVID-19 as a result of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
""Sen. Rubio’s comment is typical of ‘bash China’ remarks, but inaccurate,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""China is exporting millions of masks.""
We reached out to spokespersons for Rubio and did not receive a response.
Imports from China dropped in January and February
There were fears that China would not export critical medical supplies to the U.S. as COVID-19 cases ramped up. China produces much of the world’s protective medical equipment.
There was a dip, but the exports did continue.
China’s exports of protective medical equipment to the U.S. declined by 19% in January and February, compared with the same period last year. All other products fell by a far greater amount: 28%, according to an analysis by Chad Bown at the Peterson Institute.
""We imported less from them for these products than we did last year, but some of that is economics: They have more demand for these things internally, so they had less of an ability to export them to the world,"" Bown told PolitiFact.
New export restrictions by China also created logjams. Officials in China said the restrictions were imposed to ensure quality, but U.S. companies said they were facing bottlenecks, the Wall Street Journal reported.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







In February, the United States was focused on exporting supplies to China to fight the crisis. 
Trump administration tariffs impacted imports
The drop in imports of masks from China is not related only to COVID-19. Rubio’s op-ed did not mention the Trump administration’s increase on tariffs for various goods from China in 2018-19. That also affects imports of medical supplies.
In 2018, Matt Rowan, president of the Health Industry Distributors Association, warned that proposed tariffs would drive up health care costs. The products ""are used widely throughout health care settings and are a critical component of our nation's response to public health emergencies, such as Ebola,"" he said at a federal government hearing.
The tariff hikes for personal protective equipment and other supplies went through in September 2019 despite such warnings. U.S. imports of masks, respirators and gloves from China fell following the tariff increases. In March 2020, the federal government established a temporary exclusion for masks. 
""In other words, the fall in imports from China is largely a self-imposed wound,"" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and trade expert who is also a Peterson fellow.
The decrease in imports followed the shutdown of manufacturing regions in China in the country, she said.
The U.S. government has tried to increase the flow of supplies from China, including authorizing the use of a Chinese version of N95 masks.
Feds, states have imported supplies from China
One more point: The U.S. has imported masks and other supplies from China in recent weeks.
On March 29, Trump announced an operation called Project Air Bridge to bring medical supplies from overseas. The project’s first flight came from China on March 29 and brought millions of supplies, including 130,000 N95 masks. 
Project Air Bridge has delivered more than 760,000 N95 masks, 600 million gloves, 52 million surgical masks in addition to other supplies including surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson said. Those supplies came from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, India, Honduras and Mexico. 
From China alone, there have been over 133 million units of imported N95 masks, gloves, surgical masks, surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, FEMA said.
Some states have arranged their own imported masks or other supplies from China.
Our ruling
Rubio said ""face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus"" while the U.S. was ""largely unable to import supplies from China.""
China did have a greater need for its domestically manufactured masks in February as the virus ravaged the country, but Rubio greatly overstates the situation. Imports of masks from China to the U.S. did drop in January and February, but imports of other products dropped even more. Imports to the U.S. did occur in April through the federal government’s Project Air Bridge, and a few states arranged their own imports with the help of other entities.

Social media posts are targeting some state governors after they extended stay-at-home orders in response to the novel coronavirus.
An April 27 Instagram post includes a screenshot of a tweet that claims the Michigan Legislature stripped Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of her emergency powers because of the actions she’s taken against COVID-19. The tweet, which was posted April 26, links to a story from Neon Nettle, a website that has published misinformation in the past.
""Michigan's Democrat governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has just been stripped of her emergency coronavirus powers by her state legislature after she abused that power with insane orders such as blocking sales of vegetable seeds and American flags, etc.,"" the post reads.

Michigan’s Republican-controlled Legislature has moved to restrict Whitmer’s emergency powers. But the bills have only passed the Senate, and the governor has said she will veto any legislation that restricts executive power during the coronavirus crisis. Plus, Whitmer has not banned the sale of vegetables or American flags, as the post claims, though her orders have restricted the types of retail businesses and store departments that can stay open.

Whitmer first declared a state of emergency March 10 and issued a stay-at-home order nearly two weeks later. On April 24, Whitmer signed an executive order to extend the stay-at-home restrictions through May 15, but loosened some provisions. 
Although the number of new COVID-19 cases has slightly decreased in Michigan, Whitmer’s aggressive actions against the coronavirus have attracted the ire of Republicans in her state and across the country who say they are unnecessarily strict and harm the economy. Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, has said the governor is turning Michigan into a ""police state."" Several businesses and groups have filed lawsuits challenging the orders.
On April 16, Republicans in the state House of Representatives and Senate introduced bills that would repeal the 1945 Emergency Powers of the Governor Act, which gives the governor broad authority to declare a state of emergency in times of ""great public crisis."" Another pair of bills would amend the Emergency Management Act of 1976 to decrease the number of days the governor can declare an emergency from 28 to 14.
The Senate versions of both pieces of legislation passed in roll call votes April 24. But, as of April 29, they had not yet passed the House, which is also Republican-controlled. Whitmer has said she will veto the measures.
""Of course, I will veto bills that they send over to limit the executive power. I've been very clear about that from day one,"" she said April 23. ""Those blatant power grabs are bad in good times and dangerous in times of crisis.""
The Instagram post also errs in saying that Republicans targeted Whitmer’s emergency powers because she used them to issue orders ""blocking sales of vegetable seeds and American flags."" We rated two similar claims False — Whitmer’s executive orders do not ban the sale of any particular product.
Since Michigan legislators have moved to limit the governor’s emergency powers, the Instagram post contains an element of truth. But Whitmer’s emergency powers have not yet been repealed, and she has said she will veto the legislation if and when it reaches her desk.

Coronavirus







Donald Trump","Trump says he prevented 2 million COVID-19 deaths. Where does he get that number?




If Your Time is short




President Donald Trump keeps saying his efforts to lock down the country and implement restrictions for those traveling from China saved 2 million lives.

 
The number is taken from a model that predicted how many people would die if no mitigation measures were put in place and people continued their lives normally. Experts said it is unlikely that Americans would have taken no steps to protect themselves.




See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to have saved 2 million lives from COVID-19 through his actions to combat the disease.
He made the assertion again during the NBC News town hall on Oct. 15 that replaced the second presidential debate.
""But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,000 people,"" Trump said. ""We saved 2 million people,"" he added.
He mentioned the same ballpark figure during a Sept. 15 ABC News town hall and posted a tweet about it on Oct. 13.
Others in the Trump administration have also pointed to the 2.2 million figure. Vice President Mike Pence referenced it during the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7. So did Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar during a Sept. 20 ""Meet the Press"" television interview.
Where did this number come from? And is there any truth to the idea that Trump is responsible for saving 2 million lives from COVID-19? Since Trump continues to use it to claim success, we decided to look into it.
What we know about the ‘2 million’
The White House and the Trump presidential campaign did not respond to our request for evidence supporting the idea that roughly 2 million lives were spared because of the administration's actions.
The figure appears to have been mentioned by the president first during a March 29 White House coronavirus task force press briefing, when Trump and Dr. Deborah Birx, task force coordinator, explained they were asking Americans to stay home from mid-March through the end of April, because mathematical models showed 1.6 million to 2.2 million people could die from COVID-19. 
The warning stemmed from a paper authored by Neil Ferguson, an epidemiology professor at Imperial College London. He modeled how COVID-19 can spread through a population in different scenarios, including what would happen if no interventions were put in place and people continued to live their daily lives as normal.
In the paper, Ferguson wrote, ""In total, in an unmitigated epidemic, we would predict approximately 510,000 deaths in [Great Britain] and 2.2 million in the US.""
Ferguson did not respond to our request to talk through the study with him. But in a July email interview with HuffPost, he said Trump’s boast of having saved 2 million lives isn’t true, because the pandemic isn’t over.
Andrea Bertozzi, a mathematics professor at UCLA, said it was important to remember the 2.2 million figure was derived from a modeling scenario that would almost certainly never happen — which is that neither the government nor individuals would change their behavior at all in light of COVID-19.
The study didn’t mean to say 2.2 million people were absolutely going to die, but rather to say, ""Hold on, if we let this thing run its course, bad things could happen,"" said Bertozzi. Indeed, the results from the study did cause government leaders in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom to implement social distancing measures.
Experts also pointed out that the U.S. has the highest COVID-19 death toll of any country in the world — more than 220,000 people — and among the highest death rates, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.
""I don’t think we can say we’ve prevented 2 million deaths, because people are still dying,"" said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







In some instances when using the 2 million estimate, Trump and others in his administration cited the China travel restrictions for saving lives, while other times they’ve credited locking down the economy. We’ll explore whether either statement holds water.
Did travel restrictions do anything?
Trump implemented travel restrictions for some people traveling from China beginning Feb. 2 and from Europe on March 11. But experts say and reports show the restrictions don’t appear to have had much effect because they were put in place too late and had too many holes.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first cases of coronavirus in the U.S. arrived in mid-January. So, since the travel bans were put in place after COVID-19 was already spreading in the U.S., they weren’t effective, said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the KFF. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)
A May study supports that assessment. The researchers found the risk of transmission from domestic air travel exceeded that of international travel in mid-March.
Many individuals also still traveled into the U.S. after the bans, according to separate investigations by The New York Times and the Associated Press.
Based on all this, experts said there isn’t evidence to support the idea that the travel restrictions were the principal intervention to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
What about lockdowns?
On the other hand, the public health experts we talked to said multiple global and U.S.-focused studies show that lockdowns and implementing social distancing measures helped to contain the spread of the coronavirus and thus can be said to have prevented deaths.
However, Trump can’t take full credit for these so-called lockdown measures, which ranged from closing down all but essential businesses to implementing citywide curfews and statewide stay-at-home orders. On March 16, after being presented with the possibility of the national death tally rising to 2.2. million, the White House issued federal recommendations to limit activities that could transmit the COVID-19 virus. But these were just guidelines and were recommended to be in effect only through April 30.
Most credit for putting in place robust social distancing measures belongs to state and local government and public health officials, many of whom enacted stronger policies than those recommended by the White House, our experts said.
""I don’t think you can directly credit the federal government or the Trump administration with the shutdown orders,"" said Lessler. ""The way our system works is that the power for public health policy lies with the state. And each state was making its own individual decision.""
Some studies also explore the potential human costs of missed opportunities. If lockdowns had been implemented one or two weeks earlier than mid-March, for instance, which is when most of the U.S. started shutting down, researchers estimated that tens of thousands of American lives could have been saved. A model also shows that if almost everyone wore a mask in the U.S., tens of thousands of deaths from COVID-19 could have been prevented.  
Despite these scientific findings, Trump started encouraging states — even those with high transmission rates — to open back up in May, after the White House’s recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 expired. He has also questioned the efficacy of masks, said he wouldn’t issue a national mask mandate and instead left mask mandate decisions up to states and local jurisdictions. 
Our ruling
President Trump is claiming that if not for his efforts, there would have been 2 million more deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19.
But that 2 million number is taken from a model that shows what would happen without any mitigation measures — that is, if citizens had continued their daily lives as usual, and governments did nothing. Experts said that wouldn’t have happened in real life.
And while lockdowns and social distancing have indeed been proven to prevent COVID-19 illness and deaths, credit for that doesn’t go solely to Trump. The White House issued federal recommendations asking Americans to stay home, but much stronger social distancing measures were enforced by states.

If Your Time is short



• The United States’ vaccination program is faring well by international standards, exceeding all but two advanced industrialized nations in the percentage of residents who are considered fully vaccinated.
• However, the percentage of Americans who are fully vaccinated is 40%, not 50%. 
• In addition, five other countries have higher rates for full vaccination than the United States does.



See the sources for this fact-check




During a speech in Cleveland, President Joe Biden earned applause with a line about how well the United States has been doing in vaccinating people against the coronavirus.
""We've created more places to get vaccinated …  and now, 50% of all of America — more than any other country — is fully vaccinated,"" Biden said in his May 27 speech.
The United States’ vaccination program is faring well by international standards, but Biden’s assertion is exaggerated on two counts — both on the percentage of Americans who are fully vaccinated, and on the United States’ international ranking. 
""50% of all of America ... is fully vaccinated""
Biden flubbed this talking point.
According to data for May 27 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40% of the U.S. population is now fully vaccinated, not 50%.

Two other statistics do hover around 50%: Almost 50% of the population has received at least one dose, and slightly over 50% of all U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. (Americans younger than 12 cannot receive a vaccine yet, and the government only recently approved those between 12 and 15 to receive a vaccine. This explains why the adult vaccination figure is higher than it is for the overall population.)
But these statistics would not fit in this context, because Biden said ""all of America"" and ""fully vaccinated.""
The U.S. vaccination rate, ""50%"", is ""more than any other country""
The U.S. scores well on international vaccination percentages, but it is not No. 1 in the world.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







According to statistics compiled by Our World in Data, five countries had higher full-vaccination rates than the U.S. on May 27.  Three are small and aren’t really comparable to the U.S. — Aruba, Bahrain, and Curacao — but two are developed, industrialized nations, Israel and Chile.

 
On Biden’s broader point, the U.S. does have a higher full-vaccination rate than all members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a group of higher-income nations that is often used as a proxy for major nations — except for Israel and Chile.

 
The White House’s response
The White House told PolitiFact that in raw numbers of vaccinated individuals, the U.S. does rank No. 1. That number is backed up by Our World in Data, which reported that on May 27, the U.S. had administered 165.72 million shots, which surpasses second-place India, which had given 158.78 million shots.
However, in his statement in Cleveland, Biden explicitly referred to a percentage, not a raw number, and he specifically said ""fully vaccinated,"" which is a different measurement than the simple number of shots administered.
Our ruling
Biden said, ""Now, 50% of all of America — more than any other country — is fully vaccinated.""
The United States’ vaccination program is faring well by international standards, exceeding all but two advanced industrialized nations in the percentage of residents who are considered fully vaccinated.

Facebook posts","Fact-checking a conspiracy theory about 5G and the coronavirus




If Your Time is short





President Donald Trump signed a law March 23 that tasks the federal government with securing 5G data networks. It does not explicitly provide for the installation of more cell towers.


While some experts are concerned about the potential health effects of 5G, there is no evidence to support the symptoms listed in the post.


Misinformation about the health effects of 5G can be traced to a 2019 propaganda campaign promoted by Russian state television.





See the sources for this fact-check




A conspiracy theory with roots in a Russian propaganda campaign is getting new life amid the coronavirus pandemic.
In a March 28 post, a Facebook user refers to Public Law No. 116-129 and claims the government is taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to distract from the installation of 5G cellular data towers. The technology is the latest upgrade to speed up wireless internet connections.
""5G LAW PASSED while everyone was distracted,"" the post reads. ""Signed into law 116-129 on 3-23-2020, that will speed up the installation of 5G and protect profits! Children had to be out of schools for the covert installation. Parents are you seeing what's happening?""
The post also lists 20 purported symptoms of 5G exposure, including shortness of breath and fever — symptoms similar to those of COVID-19.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
We’ve fact-checked other conspiracy theories that falsely connect the coronavirus outbreak to the development of 5G, so we wanted to look into this one, too.
There is no evidence that the new law was deliberately passed during the COVID-19 pandemic. And while some experts have speculated that 5G’s high-frequency radio waves could have some adverse health effects, such as neurological disorders, other reports say the fear is overblown.
Trump signs law to protect 5G systems
On March 23, President Donald Trump signed a law that requires the president to work with federal agencies to ""secure and protect"" 5G infrastructure in the United States.
""The Act requires the President to develop and implement a strategy for the adoption of secure wireless communications technology in the United States and abroad,"" Trump said in a White House statement. ""The strategy will protect the American people from security threats to telecommunications networks and 5G technology.""
The Secure 5G and Beyond Act contains a provision to ""protect the competitiveness of United States companies,"" but it says nothing about the ""covert installation"" of 5G towers, as the Facebook post claims. The legislation is not specifically focused on speeding up the implementation of 5G.
By March 23, the coronavirus crisis was well underway in the U.S. The World Health Organization reported 31,573 confirmed cases across the country, and Trump said during a press briefing that the numbers ""are going to increase with time.""
However, there is no evidence that Congress waited to pass the 5G law during the coronavirus outbreak. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced the legislation last spring, and the Senate Commerce Committee finalized it in December. The full Senate passed the bill on March 4.
Is 5G dangerous?
The second part of the Facebook post lists a slew of symptoms purportedly associated with exposure to 5G networks. While some experts are concerned about the potential health effects of 5G, there is no evidence to support the flu-like effects listed in the post.
Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, supports a moratorium on 5G development. He wrote in Scientific American that there could be health effects and that research needs to be funded.
""The latest cellular technology, 5G, will employ millimeter waves for the first time in addition to microwaves that have been in use for older cellular technologies, 2G through 4G,"" he wrote. ""Given limited reach, 5G will require cell antennas every 100 to 200 meters, exposing many people to millimeter wave radiation.""

Short-term exposure to millimeter waves can cause physiological effects in the nervous system, immune system and cardiovascular system, while long-term exposure could lead to conditions like melanoma and sterility, according to Moskowitz. However, he also wrote that there is no research to confirm a correlation between 5G exposure and those broad health conditions, much less the very specific symptoms listed in the Facebook post.

""The 5G Health Hazard That Isn’t — How one scientist and his inaccurate chart led to unwarranted fears of wireless technology."" — New York Times headline


5G falsehoods echo Russian propaganda
False and misleading social media posts about 5G and coronavirus are similar to a Russian propaganda campaign that’s aimed at delegitimizing the technology’s implementation in the U.S.
In May 2019, the New York Times reported that Russian network RT America was airing unsubstantiated reports linking 5G exposure to brain cancer, infertility and autism. 
""It’s economic warfare,"" Ryan Fox, chief operating officer of technology firm New Knowledge, told the New York Times. ""Russia doesn’t have a good 5G play, so it tries to undermine and discredit ours.""
Hundreds of blogs and websites have republished RT’s dubious claims about 5G, according to the newspaper. And over the past week, we’ve seen dozens of Facebook and Instagram posts build on that misinformation by baselessly linking the coronavirus pandemic to the development of 5G.

(Screenshot from Instagram)
The conspiracies are particularly popular among anti-vaccine and alternative-health Facebook groups and Instagram accounts.
In a March 30 Instagram post, which has more than 146,000 likes, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted a conspiracy theory about 5G and the coronavirus. Kennedy, the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, is among the biggest sources of anti-vaccine advertisements on Facebook.
""The quarantine has facilitated the unobstructed #5G rollout,"" Kennedy said in his post, which echoes the claims made in the March 28 Facebook post.
According to Google Trends, search queries for ""coronavirus 5G"" have spiked since early March.
 
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed that the government used the coronavirus pandemic to distract from the passage of a 5G law.
Trump signed a law March 23 that aims to ""secure and protect"" 5G infrastructure in the U.S. The legislation has a provision to protect American companies, but it says nothing about installing more 5G towers.
While some experts have said there could be adverse health effects associated with 5G, other reports say the fears are overblown. Misinformation about 5G and the coronavirus can be traced to a Russian propaganda campaign that seeks to delegitimize the implementation of 5G.

Dan Bishop","No, half of the U.S. workforce has not been 'idled'




If Your Time is short




U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) cited a New York Times graphic showing that the 26 million people who filed for unemployment equalled the total workforce of a combined 25 states.
The total U.S. workforce is about 160 million people, so 26 million is not half of that.
The economy can also be measured by trends in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. But experts said they don't expect GDP to fall 50%.




See the sources for this fact-check




U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop has been one of North Carolina’s most vocal opponents of Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-at-home order.
Bishop, a Republican elected in 2019 to represent southwest NC, has attended protests urging Cooper to ""reopen"" the state’s economy. But in an interview on April 24, the congressman made a comment about the U.S. economy that caught our attention.
On Spicer & Co., the show of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer on the conservative Newsmax TV, he said ""half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.""
Here are his full comments:
""People who are elderly or who have underlying conditions that would subject them to the worst ravages of the coronavirus should take additional measures and, in fact, I don't object to government taking measures to see to it that those people are particularly protected,"" he said.
""But it’s quite another step to utterly devastate the economic landscape in a way — and I don’t know that I’ve seen a figure that better summarizes how bad it is, as the suggestion you just put up — that half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.""
Is it true that half of the American workforce has been idled? And what ""figure"" is Bishop referring to?
According to Bishop’s spokeswoman, Hannah Hummelberg, the congressman was referring to a New York Times stat that Spicer mentioned earlier in the segment. 
""The number of unemployment claims filed so far is equal to the total workforce, get this, of 25 states,"" Spicer said. (Spicer’s comment comes around the 1:15 mark of this video, while Bishop makes his claim shortly after the 4:30 mark.)
Clearly, a chunk of the American population has filed for unemployment. But does it add up to half of the U.S. workforce? No. 
Unemployment
By citing the New York Times stat, Bishop tied his definition of ""idle"" to unemployment numbers. So let’s put the Times’ stat in perspective. 
There were about 160 million workers in the U.S. around the start of the year. That’s according to experts we interviewed, previous PolitiFact reporting, and numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Obviously, 26 million workers — the New York Times unemployment stat cited by Bishop — is not half of 160 million. So it’s wrong to suggest half of the U.S. is unemployed.
And it’s not ""statistically sound"" to equate 26 million workers with ""half"" of the country, said Ryan Bourne, the R. Evan Scharf Chair for the Public Understanding of Economics at the Cato Institute. Cato is a think tank that advocates for free markets.
And the New York Times comparison wouldn’t work with just any grouping of 25 states. In California alone, there are 19 million workers.
""Since our population is not spread evenly across the states, the working population of 25 states doesn't provide an estimate of 50% of the national workforce,"" said Tara Sinclair, associate professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University.
Uncounted workers
The Times’ stat alone isn’t enough to support Bishop’s claim. So let’s explore other estimates of U.S. unemployment.
There are people that unemployment reports don’t account for, such as those who are furloughed or who are working reduced hours.

Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the number of people who filed for unemployment isn’t complete. He said there are several million more people who either could not get their forms in or were ineligible.
(In North Carolina, for example, the phone lines at the state’s unemployment office were so busy that many people claimed they couldn’t get through to file claims.)
Baker thinks the number of unemployed Americans is somewhere between 20-25%, he said in an May 5 email. ""I would be hesitant to use one much higher,"" he said.
CNN estimated that 43 million workers were either out of work or working reduced hours in April alone.
Public surveys
Bourne, the CATO expert, said Bishop’s claim would only be valid if considered very broadly. 
He referenced a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation that said 55% of workers had either lost jobs, lost pay, lost hours, or been furloughed since Feb. 1. 
The definition of ""idled"" is to not work or not do something. It’s a reference to inaction. The Kaiser survey included people who lost pay, but might still be working.
""This, as you can see, highlights the scale of the economic impacts of the virus and response, but is a different claim entirely,"" Bourne said.
On April 21, three days before Bishop’s claim, the Pew Research Center published a study on how the coronavirus response affected the wages of American workers.
About 28% said they or someone in their household has been laid off or lost their job. When asked if someone in the house had lost their job or taken a pay cut, 43% said yes.
Gross Domestic Product
Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody’s Analytics, said the workforce can also be judged by the U.S. GDP. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. over the course of a year.
It fell 4.8% in the first three months of the year (the first quarter), according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The bureau’s second quarter numbers run through June and are not yet available.
Deutsche Bank expects GDP to drop ""nearly 40%"" in the second quarter, according to Business Insider. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office almost mirrors that estimate, expecting a 39% drop.
""Most economists"" don’t expect GDP to dip by 50%, Lafakis said. Moody’s expects GDP to decline 33% at an annualized rate in quarter two.
Our ruling
Bishop said ""half the workforce in the country may have just been idled."" 
Bishop took a stat that’s meant to illustrate the magnitude of unemployment and misused it to falsely say half of the country’s workers are unemployed.
The U.S. workforce is roughly 160 million people. We found no official counts or expert estimates showing unemployment has reached half of that figure.
Bishop’s claim is only valid if we consider that 26 million people is equal to the working population of a specific group of 25 states, or if we look past the definition of ""idle"" and consider Americans who weren’t laid off, but whose wages were affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

• However, just about every other sentence of his remarks was filled with caveats indicating that the situation could change. He did not suggest that there was “nothing to worry about” or that the virus “posed no threat to the public.”



See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump raised eyebrows April 12 when he retweeted a supporter who had used the hashtag #FireFauci, a reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s top public health officials who has regularly joined the president on the podium in the White House press room.
The tweet that Trump shared was posted by DeAnna Lorraine, a pro-Trump Republican candidate who garnered 1.8% of the vote in an all-primary challenge to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In the primary, Lorraine finished behind Pelosi, two other Democrats and one other Republican.
The tweet came hours after Fauci told CNN’s Jake Tapper that lives could have been saved if the country had ""shut everything down"" from the beginning.
On April 12, Lorraine tweeted, ""Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could've saved more lives. Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large. Time to #FireFauci…""
Sorry Fake News, it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN https://t.co/d40JQkUZg5— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2020 
When we looked closer at Fauci’s public statements on Feb. 29, we found that Lorraine’s tweet is significantly exaggerated. (Lorraine did not respond to an inquiry.)
What was known about the virus’ spread on Feb. 29?
Feb. 29 was a key moment in the course of the virus’ spread, because it was right around the time that public health officials began to suspect that the novel coronavirus had started to infect Americans through ""community spread."" Community spread means that the virus would be spreading from person to person within a particular community, rather than through cases linked to someone who had brought the virus from a known hot spot elsewhere.
On Feb. 28, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it was possible that a reported case in California ""could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, Messonnier said. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said.
The following day, a health official from Washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of COVID-19, joined a CDC press briefing and said the state was ""starting to see some spread in the community"" and the public risk was increasing. ""Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,"" said Kathy Lofy, a Washington state health official.

Fauci is interviewed on NBC's ""Today Show"" on Feb. 29
What did Fauci say on Feb. 29?
We found two televised appearances by Fauci on Feb. 29. One was an interview in the morning with Kristen Welker and Peter Alexander on NBC’s Today Show. The other was a press briefing with Trump and other officials that afternoon.
On the Today Show, Fauci did say that the lack of widespread, confirmed community spread meant that it was not yet time for radical responses like shutting down large gatherings and businesses. But he did not go as far as the tweet described. He didn’t say that ""there was nothing to worry about"" or that coronavirus ""posed no threat to the U.S. public at large.""

Instead, his message was that the nation needed to remain vigilant for a possible worst-case scenario. Here are the relevant portions of that interview:
Alexander: ""So, Dr. Fauci, it’s Saturday morning in America. People are waking up right now with real concerns about this. They want to go to malls and movies, maybe the gym as well. Should we be changing our habits and, if so, how?""
Fauci: ""No. Right now, at this moment, there’s no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day by day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times even on this program. You’ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don’t need to change anything you’re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.""
Welker: ""Dr. Fauci, quickly, how does this all end?""
Fauci: ""You know, it ends if you -- it depends on the nature of the outbreak. I mean, this could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled. At the end of the day, this will ultimately go down. Hopefully we could protect the American public from any serious degree of morbidity or mortality. That’s the reason why we’ve got to do the things that we have in our plan.""
With the benefit of a month of hindsight, this may seem like a less-than-ringing endorsement of the types of social distancing policies that would soon become required far and wide.
Even so, the tweet exaggerates its case. Fauci repeatedly emphasized the difference between the situation on Feb. 29 and what could happen in the future. In just this two-paragraph exchange, Fauci used the phrases, ""right now, at this moment,"" ""this could change,"" ""you’ve got to watch out,"" and ""this could be a major outbreak.""
Fauci offered a similar message in the afternoon press conference.
He said, ""The country as a whole, because we get asked that all the time, still remains at low risk. But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation, and in real time we will keep you apprised of what is going on, just the same way as we are doing it today.""
Later in the briefing, Fauci said, ""We need to prepare for further challenges, and we will have them. You will hear about the additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread.""
Our ruling
Lorraine tweeted that Fauci ""was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large.""
This is misleading. Fauci did say on Feb. 29 that rules Americans would come to know as social distancing were not yet warranted.

But Pelosi has said she is open to the idea, if issues can be resolved, and backed a measure that requires the House study remote voting for its members.


Pelosi is a prominent supporter of voters casting ballots by mail.

A Facebook post paints House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as hypocritical on voting.
An image with the post shows two photos of Pelosi.
One caption reads: ""Congress shall not vote remotely because it is not secure!"" 
The other reads: ""Americans should all vote for president by mail!""
The post itself says: ""Yes she did say them both.""
Pelosi didn’t utter either of those quotes, according to our Google and Nexis searches.
Pelosi is a prominent supporter of letting voters cast ballots by mail — a process opposed by President Donald Trump, who claims it is open to fraud. But this post mischaracterizes her stance on congressional voting. 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
In late March, as the House moved to pass a $2 trillion stimulus package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Pelosi expressed reluctance about lawmakers voting remotely  on the package. But by May, she voted for a measure that requires a House committee to study remote voting.
Initial reluctance
March 24, interviews:
On the idea of holding a remote vote on the $2 trillion stimulus, Pelosi told MSNBC: ""There are serious constitutional, technological and security concerns about it. They can be addressed, but for right now, we're just working very hard to get unanimous consent so we can get this bill done, and then consider what the options are later.""
In an interview with CNN moments later, she was even more terse, The Hill reported, saying it may be an option in the future, but at the moment ""we're not prepared for (it).""

Pelosi said any changes to the requirement that House members vote in person are a long way off, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, saying that Pelosi said: ""We’re not there yet, and we’re not going to be there no matter how many letters somebody sends in — with all the respect in the world for that."" 
Her concerns included the security of any technology used, the constitutionality of changes to the rules and the time needed to be sure any new system is well thought out and bipartisan.
Pelosi’s tone changed in the weeks before the May 10 Facebook post as the need for social distancing amid the outbreak became better understood.
Open to study
April 16, teleconference with reporters:
""I've said"" to the House committee chairs about remote voting, ""give our members options; show us how we can do what. What are the options that the Constitution, the rules of the House, the technology, the security enables us to do, and that is what they have been working on. Until we have an appropriate way to do it, we can’t do it. So, it’s not about being negative on it, it’s just, show us the way … . Everybody is working so hard on all of these initiatives, including how we can come together, whether it’s by proxy voting or remote voting or whatever it is. When we are ready, we will do it.""
Sometimes the terms remote and proxy voting are used interchangeably, but they mean different things in this context. Remote refers to the concept of a member using technology to cast a vote; proxy refers to a member who is not on the House floor authorizing another member, who is on the floor, to cast their ballot.
April 26, CNN interview:
Asked if it’s time to allow remote voting during the pandemic, Pelosi said: ""I'm all for doing the remote voting by proxy. I want it to be bipartisan. The Republican leader, Mr. (Kevin) McCarthy, has assured me that he will consider this. He's not there yet; he could be there. But whether he is or not, we will — our process was to strive to make it bipartisan.""
May 20, authorization:
Pelosi formally authorized a 45-day period during which House members can vote by proxy. The House had adopted the change in rules on May 15, in a 217-189 vote, mostly along party lines; Pelosi voted yes. Any member attending a House vote can cast as many as 10 votes on behalf of colleagues.
The new rules also allow, pending certification, for a process in which lawmakers will eventually be able to cast their votes from home, either via a secure online portal or a video conferencing system. The measure requires the House Administration Committee study the feasibility of using technology to conduct remote voting in the House.
On May 26, House Republicans sued Pelosi to stop the new proxy voting system, claiming it is unconstitutional.

Charlie Kirk","Is China spying on you through Zoom? Charlie Kirk overstates report's findings




If Your Time is short





Researchers from the University of Toronto concluded April 3 that Zoom was “not suited for secrets” after identifying several security-related issues.


One of the researchers told us they did not look for or find evidence that China has actually used Zoom for spying. 


Could China exploit Zoom’s vulnerabilities for surveillance? Probably. But experts said the country probably wouldn’t dedicate resources to spying on ordinary Americans.





See the sources for this fact-check




Efforts to minimize the spread of the coronavirus through social distancing have brought video conferencing platforms more business and, with that, more scrutiny.
Zoom and other providers have experienced breakneck growth as people around the world get used to working from home and communicating with family and friends online. 
For Zoom, that growth has also revealed security vulnerabilities and a relationship with China that had at least one conservative pundit calling for a boycott.
""Stop using Zoom immediately,"" said Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in a tweet. ""Any tech company that aligns with China must be ex-communicated from our country. The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens.""
 
 
Kirk’s tweet cited an April 3 report from researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. The report spotlighted security problems using Zoom, but it didn’t look at whether China was using the tech platform ""as a way to spy on our citizens.""
""If (Kirk) is describing our findings as providing proof that the Chinese government is definitively spying on Zoom meetings, then that is inaccurate,"" said Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab and co-author of the report on Zoom’s encryption.
A spokesperson for Zoom told us the company, which is based in San Jose, California, is not aware of any efforts by China to use its platform for espionage. The FBI and Defense Department declined to comment.
Researchers found security issues with Zoom
In their report, Marczak and co-author John Scott-Railton examined the encryption scheme protecting meetings hosted on Zoom. 
They found that Zoom ""uses non-industry-standard cryptographic techniques with identifiable weaknesses"" to safeguard its conferences. The app’s encryption keys — long, random strings of characters used to protect encoded data — were sometimes routed through servers in China, even when all meeting participants are outside of China.
They wrote that this flaw is ""potentially concerning, given that Zoom may be legally obligated to disclose these keys to authorities in China,"" where they said the company employs roughly 700 people. The company’s website says it has more than 2,000 employees worldwide.
A spokesperson for Kirk cited these findings, news reports about them and China’s history of surveillance and of spying on U.S. companies as evidence in support of Kirk’s claim.
""It’s well established that China is engaged in massive amounts of domestic surveillance and has established massive controls on any data that is routed to servers hosted in China — which is exactly what Zoom has done,"" the spokesperson said.
The Citizen Lab report did conclude that Zoom is ""not suited for secrets."" It said governments, businesses concerned about cybercrime and espionage, health care providers, and activists, lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics should all be especially careful.
But Kirk’s tweet missed another conclusion that Zoom users may find reassuring.
""For those using Zoom to keep in touch with friends, hold social events, or organize courses or lectures that they might otherwise hold in a public or semi-public venue, our findings should not necessarily be concerning,"" Marczak and Scott-Railton wrote. 
Zoom is working to patch up security issues
The Citizen Lab’s findings amplified concerns that have dogged Zoom as it has gained popularity. 
Online trolls have learned to invade meetings and project graphic material using Zoom's screen-sharing feature, for example. The practice, known as ""Zoombombing,"" has led some school districts, including in New York City, to ban the platform for online learning.

Zoom has since pledged to beef up its security. In a response to the Citizen Lab’s report, CEO Eric Yuan said the routing of encryption keys through China was a ""misstep"" that resulted from Zoom’s ""urgency to come to the aid of people around the world"" as the coronavirus spread. 
The routing problem has since been corrected, Yuan said, adding that it was never an issue for the separate version of Zoom available to government customers.
The company has also clarified its encryption practices, and Yuan said in another blog post that Zoom has paused extra features for 90 days so its engineers can focus on security fixes.
""Zoom has robust cybersecurity protection and a number of layered safeguards and built-in protections to help prevent unwanted meeting access,"" a company spokesperson told us.
James Andrew Lewis, director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said concerns about Zoom strike him as ""overstated.""
""Zoom has development offices in China,"" he said. ""But its backroom functions are performed by an American cloud service provider using a very secure service located here in the U.S.""
More people working from home is a ""goldmine for intel agencies"" that China will likely exploit, he said, but other technology companies may also face similar threats. The FBI recently issued a warning about cyber attacks that could come from the increased use of videoconferencing.
Kirk overstated the Citizen Lab’s findings on China
Marczak and Scott-Railton wrote that the problems they identified make Zoom ""a clear target to reasonably well-resourced nation state attackers,"" including China. 
But they never said China is spying on American citizens through Zoom, as Kirk claimed. 
""We found that the Chinese government could conduct this sort of surveillance, but our methodology cannot produce a finding one way or the other about whether this surveillance is actually occurring,"" Marczak told PolitiFact.
He said their goal was to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited, not to catch bad actors.
""China is capable of conducting this kind of surveillance,"" he said. ""The question is whether they are actually doing it. If they are doing it, ordinary people are unlikely to be targets.""
Other cybersecurity experts agreed that China would not likely target the average American.
""I would suspect that if Chinese intel agencies are taking advantage of Zoom vulnerabilities, and I assume they are, they are targeting government users and business users,"" said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
In past Chinese hacks involving information on ordinary American citizens — including attacks on Marriott and Equifax — the hackers were after big data sets that could be used to spot patterns in people who might be willing to spy on China’s behalf, Segal said.
""You might be able to pull those things out of Zoom calls, but it would take much more work and be less reliable,"" he said.
It’s also unlikely that China would be monitoring every U.S.-based Zoom call because of the money and manpower needed to do so, experts told us. 
""In practice, the cost to do this should be high enough that China wouldn't want to use this as a mass surveillance tool, but rather a tool for targeted surveillance,"" Marczak said.
Our ruling
Kirk said, ""The Chinese Communist Party is using Zoom as a way to spy on our citizens.""
The claim is based on a report from researchers at the University of Toronto. But one of the researchers told us that while they identified security issues with Zoom, whether China has exploited the platform for espionage was not something they considered.
China is likely capable of using Zoom for spying, experts told us. It’s not implausible that the country has tried using it to target governments, businesses and others with sensitive information. 
We don’t know whether China has done so. But there’s no proof that it has. A spokesperson for Zoom said the company isn’t aware of efforts by China to tap into meetings on the platform, and experts said most ordinary Americans shouldn’t have any reason to worry.

Limited data has shown that some sports do not result in widespread transmission of coronavirus, but much remains unknown. Outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained carry the least risk. 
Indoor ice hockey in particular has caught epidemiologists' attention for several separate cases of virus transmission in different parts of the country.
Any activity where masking and social distancing cannot be maintained carries risk of transmission, experts said.  




See the sources for this fact-check




State lawmakers have been among those pushing the Cuomo administration to allow all high school sports to resume, even those the state deems ""higher risk"" such as wrestling, competitive cheerleading, basketball and hockey. 
In a news conference on Jan. 14, Assemblymember Colin Schmitt, a Republican who represents parts of Orange and Rockland counties, said neighboring states have allowed students to play and New York should follow suit. 
""We have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports,"" he said. 
Last week, the New York State Department of Health announced those sports will be allowed to return Feb. 1.
Now the question has become even more important to a lot of families whose children may want to play: Is Schmitt right? Does scientific data show it is safe to play amid a pandemic?  
Experience elsewhere
We approached Schmitt’s office about his claim, and his chief of staff, Taylor Weyeneth, sent us information from several sources. He reiterated Schmitt’s statement that with Covid-19 safety measures in place, sports can resume without a high risk of transmission. 
A news story from earlier this month dealt with rapid testing of student athletes in Michigan. The 4,000-plus students who played football and volleyball and competed in swimming competitions took a test before they practiced or competed. The state found 99.6% of the tests came back negative since testing began Dec. 30.   
A University of Wisconsin study of Covid-19 and high school sports, published in October, was based on surveys of 207 high school athletic departments that had re-started sports. Those departments accounted for more than 30,000 students, 4,000 games and 16,000 practices during September. The sports included, but were not limited to, cheerleading, soccer and football. The survey showed 271 coronavirus cases reported among the students, with only one case traced back to school sports. The infection rate among high school student athletes was lower than the rate among the general population of their peers, the authors wrote. 
We asked the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health about the study. 
The school’s dean, Dr. Robert N. Golden, said in a statement that the study does not represent the views of the school, and he cautioned the data came from high school athletic departments and that the study had not been peer-reviewed. 
""High schools across the country are working to make the best decisions they can regarding the health and safety of their athletes, and we do not believe this report should play a major role in shaping their decisions,"" said Golden. 
A survey in Kentucky tracked responses from more than 12,000 high school football players and support staff. The survey, conducted by football coaches and reported on by the Cincinnati Enquirer, found that less than 1% of participants reported being infected with the coronavirus after two months of meetings and practices. None of the cases could be traced back to workouts. Not everyone was tested. The data was collected in an effort to persuade state officials to resume play, according to the Enquirer.
Measuring risk
We asked experts about the risk of Covid-19 spread among high school athletes allowed to play amid the pandemic.

Says professional soccer player Christian Eriksen received the Pfizer vaccine days before he collapsed during a game.












By Samantha Putterman • June 14, 2021







Dr. Chad Asplund, a primary care and sports medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said from what is known, the majority of the infections do not occur during games, but through everything that goes with them: meals, travel and hanging out with teammates. ""But from the data available, it appears that there has not been a significant amount of transmission during athletic contests,"" Asplund said. 
As far as which sports are riskier, he said that those with more direct contact, such as wrestling, are more likely to transmit the virus between athletes, while outdoor sports are less likely. Indoor sports pose more risk, but some of that can be mitigated with improved ventilation and air flow. He also said spectators should be masked and socially distant, especially indoors in an enclosed space, such as a hockey rink. 
Ice hockey, considered ""higher risk"" in New York, has been deemed the source of several clusters or outbreaks around the country, including in Minnesota, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. During an amateur indoor hockey game between adults in Florida, 13 were infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
""The indoor space and close contact between players during a hockey game increase infection risk for players and create potential for a superspreader event, especially with ongoing community COVID-19 transmission,"" CDC researchers wrote. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics says ice hockey in particular ""carries a higher relative risk."" 
Regarding all youth sports, the academy cautions that the number of players, the frequency and duration of contact, and whether students are playing outside or inside can influence whether infection will be transmitted during school sports. 
""Risk can be decreased but not eliminated by athletes, parents, coaches, and officials following safety protocols,"" according to the academy’s guidance from December. 
Dr. Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, studies Covid-19 transmission. While his lab hasn’t studied this specific question, he said safe sporting events are doable with rapid tests before practices and games, twice-weekly PCR testing, contact tracing, air filtration, and proper mask wearing. 
Dr. Ingrid Ichesco, who specializes in pediatric sports medicine at Michigan Medicine C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, said there’s many benefits with sports from a physical and mental standpoint, and those benefits have to be weighed against the risks. 
""Obviously, anything where you’re in close proximity there’s a risk for Covid transmission,"" she said. 
Our ruling
Schmitt said scientific data shows it’s safe to play all sports while following health and safety protocols, even those considered ""high risk."" 
But the data that Schmitt provided did not address all of the high-risk sports.
There are indications that participation in certain sports does not lead to greater transmission of the virus. And the University of Maryland professor we talked to said he believes high school students can play sports safely by following the right precautions. But the key word in Schmitt's statement is ""scientific."" Tallying survey results is not conclusive scientific evidence regarding all of the sports that Schmitt wanted to see resumed, such as wrestling and ice hockey.  Even the medical school dean at the University of Wisconsin advised against relying on a colleague's report because it wasn't peer reviewed and the data collection depended on the high schools. If Schmitt had said ""mounting evidence"" or ""early indications"" show playing high school sports is safe amid a pandemic, that would not have been false. But he said ""scientific data,"" which implies a more rigorous standard has been met. It hasn't.

Viral image","Numbers on COVID-19 and H1N1 don't prove current outbreak response is 'hysteria'




If Your Time is short





Numbers that suggest H1N1 was worse than COVID-19 are misleading. 


It’s too early to calculate how deadly the coronavirus will be, but there are signs it’s much worse.





See the sources for this fact-check




A viral image comparing Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama argues that the coronavirus has infected far fewer Americans than did the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu — but that, due to media coverage, reaction to the coronavirus has been overblown.
Here is the full claim: 
""President Trump, COVID-19 coronavirus: 
U.S. cases: 1,329
U.S. deaths: 38
panic level: mass hysteria.
""President Obama, H1N1 virus:
U.S. cases: 60.8 million
U.S. deaths: 12,469
panic level: totally chill. 
""Do you all see how the media can manipulate your life?"" 
The post, shared on Facebook on March 13, 2020, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The numbers — for the coronavirus, as of March 12, 2020; and for the swine flu, from April 2009 to April 2010 — are essentially accurate, based on federal government counts.

“Fauci’s emails leaked.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







The numbers in the post actually show a death rate for COVID-19 at more than 100 times that of H1N1.
In any case, it is misleading to compare the two outbreaks at this point in the coronavirus pandemic.
COVID-19 has been in the United States for only about two months; the swine flu figures are for one year, from April 2009 to 2010.
As we’ve reported, it’s difficult this early in an outbreak for public health experts to estimate death rates for the coronavirus; early estimates often undercount mild cases and fail to take into account the fact that some recently infected patients are going to die in the future.
When we published this fact-check, the latest figures from the World Health Organization, for March 17, 2020, showed a surge in COVID-19 cases in the days since the post — 3,503 cases of COVID-19 in the United States, including 58 deaths.
Indeed, it’s too soon to know precisely how deadly COVID-19 is, several experts said.
""The COVID numbers in no way define the problem. We will know the problem after we do many, many tests,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina and director of its Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases.
""Comparing flu"" generally and COVID-19 ""is simply not a good idea,"" he said.  ""For flu, the world has vast experience and vaccines. And treatments. And a well-defined mortality rate far lower than COVID. So, as the world faces a new, very contagious fatal infection, it is not surprising that we all feel anxious.""
Said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine and physiology and biophysics at the University of Southern California: ""The raw numbers make H1N1 look worse, but in reality the risk of death is much higher for COVID-19.""
As for the post’s claim of mass hysteria over coronavirus versus a totally chill response to H1N1, it’s worth noting President Barack Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency when the United States had only 20 confirmed cases of H1N1 and no deaths.
Moreover, as FactCheck.org reported, while the H1N1 death toll may sound high, it was far lower than initially expected. It also turned out to have a case fatality rate of just 0.02% — well below even many typical seasonal influenzas. 
So, given that indications are the coronavirus death rate is much higher — and given that experts warn the nation’s hospitals are under-prepared to treat the numbers of patients predicted to need care — it makes sense that state and local governments are taking significant action to limit its spread.
Our ruling

Bloggers","Fact-checking claims that Pelosi tried to add abortion funding in new coronavirus bill




If Your Time is short





The HEROES Act doesn’t contain any mention of abortion services, and the proposed  changes to funding rules aren’t specific to Planned Parenthood.


The organization would be eligible for Paycheck Protection Program loans under the bill’s expanded eligibility guidelines for nonprofits.





See the sources for this fact-check




In March, conservative groups falsely accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of trying to include abortion funding in the first coronavirus stimulus bill. 
Now, anti-abortion website Life News claims that Pelosi has been ""caught"" trying to do something similar in a $3 trillion package that passed the House on May 15, 2020.
""Pelosi is back at it — trying to remove the safeguards from the previous bill to exclude Planned Parenthood from small business bailouts in her new Phase 4 relief legislation,"" the story says. 
It also claims that, under the bill’s proposal to help state and local governments, ""states would be free to pass along taxpayer dollars to the Planned Parenthood abortion business.""
The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
There is an element of truth to the claim that the bill does not explicitly restrict states from using funds to cover abortion services, but it leaves out important context that could give a different impression.
What is in the HEROES Act
The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act passed the House by a vote of 208-199, with only one Republican in favor. It awaits action in the Senate, where its prospects are dim.
The key provisions include nearly $1 trillion for state and local governments, a $200 billion hazard-pay fund for essential workers, and $75 billion to support coronavirus testing, contact tracing and patient isolation. The bill also offers a new round of direct payments to families. It’s meant to boost the economic support to individuals and businesses provided by the $2 trillion CARES Act.
RELATED: House coronavirus bill would aid immigrants, relatives cut out of previous aid package
Pelosi’s office called headlines that she was caught trying to include abortion funding in the new bill ""completely false.""
The changes made in relation to nonprofits
The bill does not mention abortion. What Life News and other websites are talking about, in part, involves eligibility for the Paycheck Protection Program established in March.
The program offered low-interest loans to small businesses and nonprofits to keep employees on the payroll during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic. The program is administered by the Small Business Administration with support from the Treasury Department.
The CARES Act included a cap on the size of organizations that could receive the money, but the new House bill attempts to expand nonprofit organizations’ access to aid by setting aside 25% of available PPP funds for nonprofits, removing the size and category restrictions for them and steering more aid to smaller nonprofits.
Proposed changes to the PPP provisions aren’t specific to Planned Parenthood, which offers a range of women’s health services that includes abortions. But the expanded guidelines would make a large group like Planned Parenthood eligible for the loans.
Meanwhile, there’s already a fight over about $80 million in subsidized SBA loans that were given to state and local Planned Parenthood affiliates. Over 125 Republicans have called for a federal investigation into the loans, and the SBA ordered the chapters to give back the money, saying they’re too closely affiliated with the national organization to be considered independent entities. 
Planned Parenthood released a statement denouncing the criticism, saying its independent affiliates complied with eligibility rules in applying for and receiving the loans.

Other corporate entities, such as AutoNation and Ruth’s Hospitality Group (which owns Ruth’s Chris Steak House), have faced similar scrutiny for receiving millions in PPP loans through their local affiliates. The companies said they will return the money. The Treasury says it will audit every company that received more than $2 million from the programs.
What about state and local government funding?
The Life News claim that ""states would be free to pass along taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood"" stems from a provision to give fiscal relief to state and local governments.
The HEROES Act provides $540 billion in funding to assist state governments with the fiscal impacts from the public health emergency, and $375 billion to local governments. 
The website quotes Tom McClusky, president of the anti-abortion group March for Life Action, as saying the bill would allow federal tax dollars to pay for abortions through subsidized health care plans and would authorize over $900 billion in ""open-ended funding"" at the state and local level, ""so nothing would prevent this money from further subsidizing the abortion industry.""
The bill doesn’t include the Hyde Amendment budgetary rider, which prohibits the federal government from covering the costs of abortions except in very rare cases. The concern is that without the rider, state and local governments could pass some of the money along to Planned Parenthood for abortion services.
In the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the first emergency aid bill, language was amended by Democrats to limit funds to cover only COVID-19 expenses. So far, the same has not been done in the HEROES Act.
Specifically, the Hyde Amendment states that federal Medicaid funds cannot cover an abortion unless the woman’s life is in danger or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. But it does not limit a state’s ability to use its own funds to cover abortion.
As of January 2020, 15 states use their own funds to extend abortion coverage to Medicaid enrollees, while 34 states and the District of Columbia follow the amendment’s standards. One state, South Dakota, does not follow Hyde standards and pays for abortions only when they are necessary to protect a woman's life.
Laurie Sobel, associate director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the suggestion that states could use emergency funds for abortion services is not easy to respond to, but it wouldn’t happen through Medicaid.
Any added federal money for Medicaid, Sobel said, would likely come in the form of increased reimbursements to states for the federal share of most Medicaid expenses, in which the Hyde language applies. 
She said it’s unlikely that the state's general emergency funds will be able to be spent freely, but rather that the funds will be designated for particular uses.
We reached out to Life News for comment but didn’t hear back by time of publication.
Our ruling
A website claims that Pelosi tried ""once again"" to include abortion funding in the latest coronavirus bill. 
The HEROES Act does not contain any mention of abortion, and there is no section that funnels money specifically for those services. 
As is, the bill would make it easier for nonprofit organizations, including large ones like Planned Parenthood, to receive funds under the Paycheck Protection Program. 
Anti-abortion groups are also pointing to the lack of language explicitly barring state and local governments from using federal relief money to fund abortions as evidence of Pelosi getting ""caught."" 
But health policy experts say the Hyde amendment restrictions still apply to federal support under Medicaid, and that aid to states will likely be designated for specific uses, and won’t be open-ended.
The claim is largely speculative about the use of the money and oversimplifies the allocation of federal funds.

Coronavirus







Janel Brandtjen","Yes, children do get coronavirus. It just might not be as serious.




If Your Time is short





 Children do contract the coronavirus. Hundreds of cases in people 17 and under have been reported in Wisconsin, and tens of thousands in the U.S. 


 But early evidence shows that children are not at higher risk for the virus, and in most cases, experience milder symptoms than adults. 





See the sources for this fact-check




There are several diseases that are especially tough on kids. 
Measles, chickenpox and even this year’s most common strain of influenza in Wisconsin target children and can cause serious, even life-threatening complications. 
So the world breathed a sigh of relief when the first reports about children and COVID-19 seemed to show that this novel coronavirus wouldn’t be one of those diseases. 
A preliminary report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published April 6, 2020, found that children make up only a small portion of U.S. coronavirus cases thus far and are less likely to become seriously ill. 
As the debate continues about how quickly to relax restrictions and reopen the country, that information has become a key part of the reopen-now argument.
State Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, dove into the issue in the comments section of an April 28, 2020 post on her Facebook page that criticized Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for not opening playgrounds and restrooms at parks. 
Replying to a commenter, she wrote, ""In fact, New York is considering opening schools because children don’t seem to be getting this virus."" 
A few days later, though, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared that all schools in the state would be closed for the remainder of the academic year. (Evers made the call weeks earlier that Wisconsin schools would be closed through June.)
But is Brandtjen right about the rest of her claim — that ""children don’t seem to be getting this virus""?
The numbers
As of May 21, 2020, the CDC reported that 40,457 of the country’s more than 1 million coronavirus cases occurred in patients 17 and under. 
To be sure, that is a tiny fraction of overall cases, clocking in at just 3% of the 1.2 million cases listed by the CDC. But it’s still more than 40,000 children who have gotten sick with COVID-19, in the official count. Others, of course, may have gotten sick and never been tested. 
In Wisconsin, the same pattern holds: 257 cases have been reported in patients 9 and under, and 695 in patients ages 10-19 (the state Department of Health Services uses different age breakdowns than the CDC).

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The two age groups account for just 7% of the state’s total coronavirus cases, and even less for whom the disease turned more serious. Just 32 people under the age of 20 have been hospitalized by the virus, according to the DHS website. 
Although the numbers are small, they’re there — and there, too, are the rare cases that have turned fatal. Wisconsin has avoided the death of a child from the virus so far, but nationally, a handful of deaths have occurred in pediatric cases. 
So, children do seem to be getting this virus. 
The nuance 
But what early data and the raw numbers show is that they seem to be contracting it far less, and less seriously, too. 
That’s what Brandtjen pointed to when asked to back up her claim. In a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin she said her choice of words in saying that children don’t ""seem"" to be getting the virus acknowledged that nuance. 
Brandtjen cited a CDC webpage on kids and coronavirus which notes that children don’t appear to be at higher risk, and most U.S. cases appear in adults. 
She also quoted a Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin news release stating that ""one of the main understandings was that (COVID-19) didn’t affect healthy kids as seriously as adults."" In the release, the hospital wrote that only a handful of children there tested positive for the virus, and all went home after brief hospitalizations. 
The Children’s release, however, brings up another distinction in the conversation about kids and COVID-19: a new, more serious disease known as Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, or PIMS. 
No kids at Children’s have presented with PIMS symptoms, the release says, and research on the link between PIMS and the coronavirus is still limited. But doctors in New York, which as of May 12 was investigating 102 cases of the syndrome and three deaths, suspect COVID is involved. Though rare and treatable, it’s likely another way the virus is affecting kids. 
And one more bit of nuance: As schools across the country mull over opening their doors this fall, research is still being done on whether and how much children can spread the virus. The answer could be critical to the discussion of what reopening schools, day care centers and other places where kids gather should look like moving forward. 
Our ruling 
Brandtjen claimed ""Children don’t seem to be getting this virus.""
Hundreds of kids in Wisconsin, and tens of thousands in the U.S., have fallen ill with COVID-19. 
That said, children do not seem to be contracting the virus as much, or as seriously, as the rest of the population. That’s an important nuance, particularly amid such a contentious debate.

Van Wanggaard","Wisconsin senator off-base with claim that it’s unknown whether young people spread COVID-19




If Your Time is short





Though very few COVID-19 deaths have been reported in people under 20, it’s more than zero, as initially claimed. Nationwide, 96 people under 18 have died from the virus as of Oct. 12, 2020, CDC data show


Further, the claim that it is unknown whether people under 20 can spread the virus to older adults is off-base: A CDC report found that in outbreak hotspots throughout the U.S. disease prevalence among older age groups occurred after prevalence rose in younger people.





See the sources for this fact-check




As a surge in COVID-19 cases threatens to overwhelm Wisconsin hospitals, Republican lawmakers are still pushing to overturn measures put in place by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to address it, including the statewide mask mandate. 
That includes state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, who told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he would not back a mask mandate even if the outbreak in Wisconsin became 10 times worse. (The mandate survived an initial court challenge Oct. 12, 2020.)
Wanggaard also sought to downplay the seriousness of the virus in young people as he argued that young people should not have to wear masks. 
He told the Journal Sentinel in an Oct. 7, 2020 video interview that no one under the age of 20 has died of COVID-19, and that ""it has not actually been determined yet"" that anyone under 20 can spread it to an older person. 
This is off-base. Let’s break it down. 
Wanggaard makes broad generalizations that stray from fact 
Wanggaard’s first claim is that no one under 20 has died of complications from the virus. 
When pressed, Wanggaard backtracked and said that ""less than a third of a percent"" of those in that age group who have contracted COVID-19 have died. 
This is more accurate. Of the nearly 500,000 cases confirmed among Americans ages 0-17, 96 have died, as of Oct. 12, 2020. But it’s not zero. (To be sure, as of Oct. 12, 2020, there were zero deaths in that category in Wisconsin, but Wangaard did not specify the state and was speaking broadly in the interview.)
Even if the risk of serious illness is lower among young, healthy people, experts have long raised concerns that they could spread it to older adults who are more susceptible to serious illness and death. Wanggaard disputed that, claiming that it has not been determined whether a young person could spread the disease to an older person.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







When asked for evidence to back up Wanggaard’s statement, a spokesman for the senator said he had Googled and found links to four studies conducted throughout the world that found children were rarely transmitting the virus and did not appear to be ""superspreaders"" -- that is, able to infect a disproportionate number of people. 
But showing that young people rarely transmit the virus does not mean, as Wanggaard said, that we do not know whether they ever can. 
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on transmission dynamics by age group in hotspot areas of the U.S., released Oct. 9, 2020, found that the percentage of people testing positive among older age groups began to increase after it increased among people ages 0-17 and 18-24. That suggests that at least some younger people were passing the virus to older people. 
It would have been fair for Wanggaard to say that the jury may still be out on how much young people drive transmission, especially young children. 
But to say that it is not known whether someone under 20 can infect an older person is misleading at best. 
What’s more, there is no scientific reason to believe that the virus would behave differently once the person infected turned 20 or older. Indeed, there have been numerous outbreaks on college campuses and in elementary and high schools around the country.

 
Our ruling
Wanggaard told a reporter that COVID-19 had caused zero deaths in people under 20, later backtracking to say that it had caused very few, and claimed that it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult. 
While it’s correct that deaths among that age group are few, and some studies have found that young children did not account for a disproportionate amount of transmission of the virus, the senator’s statement is too absolute to account for the nuance. 
Our definition of Mostly False is a claim that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

A Food and Drug Administration presentation shows a “working list of possible adverse event outcomes” from coronavirus vaccines. They include several chronic conditions and death. 


That list includes all possible — not known — side effects. The FDA has not found reason to believe the coronavirus vaccines awaiting approval could cause death. 


In the past, GreenMedInfo has made false claims about vaccines, including that they cause autism.





See the sources for this fact-check




An alternative health website that has published articles claiming vaccines cause autism is now setting its sights on the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
In a Dec. 6 article, GreenMedInfo wrote that a document from the Food and Drug Administration revealed the government was worried about a slew of potential side effects from coronavirus vaccines. Among them: death.
""Public discussion and documents reveal that the FDA knows that rushed-to-market COVID-19 vaccines may cause a wide range of life-threatening side effects, including death,"" the article says below a large advertisement for an alternative health book.
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s been shared thousands of times by anti-vaccine Facebook pages and groups, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.
As U.S. coronavirus cases near 300,000, public health agencies are developing a strategy to distribute vaccines to millions of Americans in 2021. The first doses could be only days away, so we wanted to take a closer look at the claim that they could cause serious harm.
The article is misleading. 

(Screenshot from GreenMedInfo)
While the FDA is monitoring for potential adverse side effects, it has not found that any of the coronavirus vaccines seeking approval cause death. And just because COVID-19 vaccines were developed in record time doesn’t mean they’re unsafe.
GreenMedInfo cited an Oct. 22 presentation given during a meeting of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. A slide in the presentation shows a ""working list of possible adverse event outcomes"" from coronavirus vaccines. Among them are chronic conditions like autoimmune disease and arthritis, as well as stroke and death. 
But that doesn’t mean the FDA has reason to believe the coronavirus vaccines awaiting emergency-use authorization could cause death. 
""As indicated on the slide, this is a description of the possible, not known, adverse event outcomes that the FDA will be monitoring for as the vaccine is deployed,"" a spokesperson told PolitiFact. ""As described in slides, the FDA plans on monitoring 10-20 outcomes of interest.""
While vaccines often take 10 to 15 years to develop, several potential COVID-19 vaccines were developed in a matter of months. There are several reasons for that, including the fact that scientists had previously worked on vaccines for similar coronaviruses and funding agencies poured billions of dollars into COVID-19 vaccine research.

The FDA uses emergency-use authorizations during public health emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. A vaccine that’s granted an emergency-use authorization is different from an FDA-approved vaccine in that for emergency authorization, ""the totality of scientific evidence"" must make it ""reasonable to believe that the product may be effective."" For official approval, vaccines must demonstrate ""substantial evidence"" of efficacy and proof of safety.
Vaccines that are granted an emergency-use authorization still go through a rigorous review process, including all phases of clinical trials.
""Clinical trials are evaluating investigational COVID-19 vaccines in tens of thousands of study participants to generate the scientific data and other information needed by FDA to determine safety and effectiveness,"" the FDA says on its website. ""These clinical trials are being conducted according to the rigorous standards set forth by the FDA.""
Deaths during clinical trials
We reached out to GreenMedInfo for a comment. Founder Sayer Ji said his website’s intention was ""to counterbalance the highly biased promotion of vaccines as ‘safe and effective’ a priori.""
Ji also cited an FDA briefing document on the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its partner, BioNTech. The United Kingdom on Dec. 8 became the first country to start distributing the vaccine, and Canada approved it the next day.
In the document, the FDA reported that six of 43,448 participants died during clinical trials of the vaccine held from April to November. Two had been given the vaccine, and four had received a placebo. 
Both participants who received the vaccine and died were older than 55; one died from cardiac arrest, the other from arteriosclerosis. The vaccine was not listed among the causes of their deaths, which the FDA said were characteristic of their age groups. 
Although the agency did note some minor side effects associated with the vaccine, including fatigue and headache, it said there were ""no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance"" of emergency use authorization.
RELATED: Many Americans say they don’t want a vaccine. Should we be worried?
The FDA’s assessment supports Pfizer’s Nov. 18 announcement that its vaccine was safe and 95% effective at preventing the coronavirus. The agency will meet Dec. 10 to discuss whether to approve the emergency-use authorization, after which it will be assessed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and continue to be studied in clinical trials.
""The FDA would only issue an EUA if the vaccine has demonstrated clear and compelling efficacy in a large well-designed phase 3 clinical trial,"" the FDA told PolitiFact. ""If an EUA is issued, the process will not be rushed, and no shortcuts will be taken around having the relevant phase 3 efficacy results.""

We’ve seen plenty of posts comparing New York and Florida on their handling of the coronavirus that seem to make the case that Republicans in Florida are managing the pandemic better than Democrats in New York.


But the comparisons are fraught for a number of reasons. The pandemic largely erupted in the United States in New York, before doctors had the equipment and therapeutics needed to fight the disease. Florida benefited from the lessons New York learned.


The numbers in this particularly viral image need context and some lack accuracy.

Who would have thought a global pandemic would only heighten a longstanding rivalry between Florida and New York?
Tensions flared early in the COVID-19 outbreak when Florida issued restrictions on travelers from New York, then a raging hot spot for the virus. New York returned the favor in the summer, putting Florida travelers on its own quarantine list.
Now, social media users are comparing the two states’ handling of the virus, sharing a pro-Florida Instagram post from an account called ""Unwoke Narrative"" that points to the states’ politically opposed governors as reasons for differences in state COVID-19 data. 

Invoking the names of Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and New York’s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a graphic titled ""Cuomo vs. DeSantis: How NY & FL Handled the Virus"" lists several COVID-19 figures for each state. ""Cuomo maintained strict lockdowns, crushing jobs and freedom,"" it says. ""DeSantis took the opposite route and rejected tyranny. Who was right?""
Spoiler alert: The graphic determines Florida is the winner ""even though Florida has a larger population,"" ""is disproportionately elderly"" and ""is visited by more potentially infected tourists."" 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It cites as sources the Washington Examiner, New York Post, NBC, Washington Post and Statista. The accompanying text points readers to a website with more information. Some of the numbers check out. The graphic is close, for example, on the spread between the states’ hospitalizations and vaccinations administered.
But when we reviewed the overall claim, we found the broader comparison misleads by oversimplifying the relationship between the data and lockdown rules in each state. 
Let’s take a look.
New York's early battle
The post’s most glaring omission, experts told us, was its lack of context about the pandemic’s timing and impact in the two states.
""New York was the epicenter of the pandemic last spring, long before Florida had significant numbers of cases,"" said Richard Mollot, executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit focused on improving quality of care for people in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
The virus hit New York early and hard, before there was enough access to personal protective equipment and before health officials or emergency room doctors and nurses knew much about the virus, including the best ways to treat and stabilize it. 
The result was mass devastation and death. During that early stage, the state was averaging over 900 deaths a day.
Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health at the University of South Florida, said not only was New York’s experience unlike any other in the nation, but it also informed how the rest of the country would manage the pandemic. ""There’s no question that Florida hospitals were able to learn from what New York went through and benefited as a result,"" she said.
Nursing home deaths needs context 
Cuomo’s administration has faced intense scrutiny over its undercounting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. New York’s attorney general released a Jan. 28 report that found the state had failed to report thousands of deaths. Hours later, the state’s health department added more than 3,800 deaths to the tally, each a resident whose hospital death had not been previously counted.
Yes, New York is reporting higher numbers of COVID-19 deaths of nursing home and assisted living facility residents than Florida, but we couldn't find data that puts it as high as the graphic reports — 15,000+ in New York compared with 9,000+ in Florida. The latest state numbers from Feb. 4, which includes the hospitalization data, show about 13,300 have died in New York. Florida’s total is around 9,700.
Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst at Kaiser Family Foundation who has tracked the pandemic’s impact on long-term care facility residents, said the post is problematic because states collect and report data differently.
""They're not necessarily comparable,"" she said. ""Non-nursing home settings are defined differently in each state. The best way to compare is to look at recent trends in federal data."" 
As of Feb. 7, such federal data showed New York had 10.1 positive COVID-19 cases per 1,000 nursing home residents, while Florida was at 6.3. When it came to deaths per 1,000 residents, New York was at 2.99 residents and Florida at 1.85.
It’s important to note that the states don’t have comparable nursing home population numbers, at least as of 2019. New York was reporting about 19,000 more residents in certified nursing facilities than Florida, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data.

“Fauci’s emails leaked.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







Deaths in each state
The post is right that New York has had more deaths than Florida, even when accounting for population.
The numbers it says it relies on are not far from what we saw recorded on Feb. 25, when New York was reporting about 247 deaths per 100,000 people compared with Florida’s 143. 
But the metric again ignores New York’s unprecedented early peak and the ebb and flow of death rates across states over time. Daily deaths have surged in Florida at times when they remained low in New York, and vice versa.
""There’s a time factor here,"" Levine said. ""These pandemics are really epidemics that happen in different places at different times, and you have to really consider that when you’re doing comparisons."" 
On April 14, for example, when the first wave peaked in New York, the state had a seven-day average of 39.3 deaths per 1 million residents while Florida was at 2.1, according to the COVID Tracking Project. On Aug. 16, Florida recorded a seven-day average 8.5 deaths per million people while New York was at 0.2.
""The implication is that the political decisions in Florida versus New York has led to those numbers, but I think that would be a very shallow interpretation of the data,"" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, an assistant professor in health policy and management at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Lockdown measures do work.""
PolitiFact previously found that some of the more strictly regulated states performed better than Florida, as of early December 2020. And a study that Tsai participated in that has been preliminarily accepted for publication found that first-wave lockdowns did result in a downtick in COVID-19 cases two weeks later.
Daily COVID-19 cases by state
Daily case numbers provide a snapshot of how one state compares with another on any given day. And the post’s figures showing Florida had 7,400 daily cases as of Feb. 8 while New York was at 9,000 is in the ballpark with what we see in COVID Tracker data for that period.
But the metric does not reflect additional data points that place New York in a better position than Florida: the number of people tested and each state’s rolling positivity average. It again ignores that there were times when daily cases were high in Florida when they were not in New York.  
On Feb. 8, New York reported a 5.1% positivity rate, according to state data and Florida saw a 7% positivity rate. The seven-day average of positive cases for the week ending Feb. 8 show New York in a better position, too, with a 5.2% average compared with 8.3% in Florida.
Job losses
Job losses in New York over the course of the pandemic have outpaced Florida’s, but experts caution against making such comparisons. 
The graphic shows over 1 million jobs lost in New York versus more than 400,000 in Florida, and that lines up with data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Florida’s economy, fueled by out-of-state tourism and service industries, was hit hard by the pandemic. But the impact on jobs may have been mitigated by its warm weather, which allowed for dining and other types of public gatherings and businesses to continue operating outdoors. 
Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, said places that have faced longer-term economic challenges, like much of upstate New York, have lost more jobs in the pandemic.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-of-center American Action Forum, urged caution when comparing state economies, including adjusting for time periods when the states were having similar impacts from the virus and state policies. ""I’m not morally opposed to compare across states, but you do have to be careful to do the comparison in a fair way,"" he said.
While Florida was able to keep its economy more open, it came at a cost.
To better understand the balance between economic recovery and public health, MoneyGeek analyzed the rate of case growth and deaths versus the rate of jobs recovered using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Johns Hopkins. 
Looking at job losses from February 2020 and measuring job gains in each state from the point of highest job loss to the point of highest recovery, the report found that red states like Florida ""recovered 35% more jobs than blue states — 65% compared to 48%. However, red-state recovery rates came at a higher price, with 99% more COVID-19 cases and 78% more deaths per recovered job than blue states.""
Florida recorded 50 cases per 100 jobs recovered, according to the analysis, while New York recorded 19.
Our ruling
An Instagram post says New York’s lockdown measures led to more death and economic destruction while Florida’s more open approach led to less.
The post overstates the correlation between the numbers and lockdown rules. It leaves out important factors, including environment and public health initiatives, and ignores that the two states collect and report data differently.
Most significantly, it ignores that New York City was the epicenter of the nation’s first wave, before doctors had the equipment, therapeutics and experience needed to fight the new disease. States like Florida were able to learn and benefit from New York’s experience.

Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum on Monday defended President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying his January decision to restrict travel from China was “ahead of the curve.” 

 
Santorum’s comments came one day after Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told CNN anchor Jake Tapper that earlier implementation of social-distancing and stay-at-home orders could have saved lives lost to the coronavirus.

 
Really, Trump wasn’t “ahead of the curve,” as Santorum said. He was following the advice of experts in his own administration – and the actions of the industry directly affected by the move. And about 45 nations restricted travel from China before the United States.

Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum on Monday defended President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in an interview with CNN anchor John King.
""The president looks like he was ahead of the curve – as you know, he talks about this all the time – on shutting down travel from China,"" said Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania who lost his bid for a third term in 2006.
Santorum’s comments came one day after Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told CNN anchor Jake Tapper that earlier implementation of social-distancing and stay-at-home orders could have saved lives lost to the coronavirus.
Santorum called Fauci’s remarks ""Monday morning quarterbacking"" and sought to redirect attention to other coronavirus mitigation strategies he believes the Trump administration embraced early on. Fauci, later on Monday, said his remarks were hypothetical.
We wondered whether Trump’s decision to restrict travel from China was as prescient as Santorum described.
The administration announced the restrictions on Jan. 31 and they took effect two days later. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the country.
Trump has repeatedly said he acted to restrict travel – first from China, then from Iran and finally from Europe – despite objections from experts.
""But we closed those borders very early, against the advice of a lot of professionals, and we turned out to be right. I took a lot of heat for that,"" Trump said on March 4.
Later that same day, Trump spoke about the rationale behind his decision, telling Fox anchor Sean Hannity, ""Everybody said, it’s too early, it’s too soon, and good people, brilliant people, in many ways, doctors and lawyers and, frankly, a lot of people that work on this stuff almost exclusively. And they said, don’t do it.""
Trump repeated the claim again at the Scranton town hall he held on March 5, saying he imposed the travel restrictions ""against the advice of almost everybody.""

By Jon Greenberg • June 2, 2021







The World Health Organization did caution against the overuse of travel restrictions around the time the one imposed by the U.S. first took effect, but public health officials in this country and many airlines themselves agreed on the policy’s importance.
Several airlines voluntarily halted flights between the U.S. and China a few days before the administration’s travel restrictions took effect. And Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said experts in his department all agreed that restricting travel from countries with coronavirus outbreaks was the right call.
""The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,"" Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. ""These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.""
What was the rest of the world thinking at the same time? We consulted Think Global Health, an initiative of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations that is tracking travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19.
By the group’s count, about 45 nations restricted travel from China before the United States. That number covers variations of travel restrictions in effect up to and including Feb. 1.
Think Global Health’s tracker includes partial or total land border closures, suspension of flights to and from China, visa restrictions, such as a pause on visa-on-arrival programs, and entry restrictions (similar to what the United States implemented).
""While the United States was not one of the first countries to impose restrictions against travel from China, nor was it late to do so relative to the actions of others,"" said Samantha Kiernan, a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Rather, the United States acted around the same time that many other countries did.""

Santorum said, ""The president looks like he was ahead of the curve – as you know, he talks about this all the time – on shutting down travel from China.""

If Your Time is short





Despite decades of research, there is no vaccine against HIV given unique challenges the virus poses, such as rapid mutations that are difficult for the immune system to adapt to. 


There are some vaccines to prevent and even treat some cancers, but not all cancers are caused by a virus. 


There are many different rhinoviruses that can cause the common cold. That makes it difficult for researchers to create a vaccine that can address them all.


Governments around the world have invested in companies to help speed up a COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines up for FDA evaluation have characteristics that allow them to be produced faster than other commonly known vaccines. 





See the sources for this fact-check




It typically takes years to develop and approve vaccines, yet for COVID-19, first reported in late 2019, federal regulators are already reviewing vaccines that researchers say are more than 94% effective.
The speed of the vaccines' development has some people on social media questioning their safety.
""So let me get this straight,"" says a Dec. 6 Facebook post. ""40 years of research, and no vaccine for HIV. At least 100 years of research and no vaccine for cancer. Ongoing research, and no vaccine for the common cold. Now in less than a year, there's a vaccine for COVID-19??? Nah I think I’ll pass on that shot!!!""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The facts show that what accounts for the disparity is not undue haste with the COVID-19 vaccine, but rather important differences between the illnesses highlighted in the post, and a new approach to vaccine development.
For example, there are many types of cancers, and only a few are known to be caused by viruses.
""So a universal vaccine to prevent ‘cancer’ is not something that is possible or pursued,"" said Jan Carette, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine. ""For specific viruses that cause specific forms of cancer, vaccines have been developed."" 
The post also ignores unique medical challenges in creating vaccines against HIV and the common cold.
COVID-19 vaccines
The COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer that are up for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are a type called ""mRNA."" Researchers have been studying this type of vaccine technology for decades.
Most vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing weakened or inactivated versions of the disease-causing pathogen (such as a virus or bacterium) into the body. The mRNA vaccines, by contrast, use a genetic messenger to teach cells in the body how to make a protein — or even just a piece of a protein — to trigger an immune response. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more information on how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work.)
An mRNA vaccine has shorter manufacturing times and can be developed in labs using readily available materials. ""This means the process can be standardized and scaled up, making vaccine development faster than traditional methods,"" according to the CDC.
Health officials have said that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are being held to the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines allowed in the United States.
The Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, an initiative to help speed up the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and other therapeutics, has also played a significant role in getting the vaccines to market. The federal government has made vaccine deals totaling more than $9 billion with multiple private companies. The deals vary in scope; some are only for the purchase of vaccines, other agreements provide funding for the research and manufacturing of vaccines.

Flawed comparison to HIV, cancer, common cold 
The CDC says there are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect people. One of them is the new virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. A study published in November by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said that vaccines may be more effective on a current and common strain of SARS-CoV-2, compared with a previous strain of the virus.
Common cold: Around 80% of common cold cases are caused by rhinoviruses — of which there are over 100 different types, many circulating at the same time, said Carette, the Stanford researcher. The common cold can also be caused by many different respiratory viruses, making it difficult for a single vaccine to target all varieties of the cold.
The possibility of a vaccine composed of 50, 100 or more distinct human rhinovirus antigens ""has been viewed as formidable or impossible and has discouraged many vaccine makers,"" Carette said.
HIV: A vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, has proved especially challenging because the immune system responds to HIV differently from other viruses. While all viruses change, HIV mutates rapidly and has unique ways of evading the immune system. ""There are no documented cases of a person living with HIV developing an immune response that cleared the infection,"" says the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
In clinical trials, inactivated HIV has not been effective at eliciting immune responses and, a live form of HIV is too dangerous to use, according to the institute. Research on an HIV vaccine has been going on since the 1980s.
Cancer: There are vaccines available to help prevent human papillomavirus infections, and some strains of HPV have been linked to some cancers. Most cervical cancers are caused by infection with HPV, according to the American Cancer Society. 
The American Cancer Society also says that people who have long-term infections with the hepatitis B virus are at higher risk for liver cancer, and getting a hepatitis B vaccine may lower some people’s risk of getting liver cancer.
There are also vaccines to treat certain types of cancers; these vaccines are intended to work against cancer cells, not against something that causes cancer. 
""Sometimes a patient’s own immune cells are removed and exposed to these substances in the lab to create the vaccine,"" the cancer society says. ""Once the vaccine is ready, it’s injected into the body to increase the immune response against cancer cells.""
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed, ""40 years of research, and no vaccine for HIV. At least 100 years of research and no vaccine for cancer. Ongoing research and no vaccine for the common cold. Now in less than a year, there's a vaccine for COVID-19?"" The post questions the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines on that basis.
Vaccines for COVID-19 were poised to be evaluated by regulators about a year after the virus was discovered. But the post goes too far in drawing conclusions about the vaccines’ safety based on how quickly they were developed compared with efforts to fight other illnesses. It ignores important differences in the development process, and characteristics of the illnesses that make them not directly comparable to COVID-19.
Health officials have said that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are being held to the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines allowed in the United States.

Donald Trump","Fact-checking Trump’s attacks on Obama-Biden swine flu response




If Your Time is short





Elements of Trump’s blame for the H1N1 pandemic that killed thousands of Americans are either wrong or misleading. 


Joe Biden was not in charge of the Obama administration’s H1N1 response. 


Trump overstated public confidence in his administration’s response to the coronavirus and downplayed confidence in the Obama administration’s response to H1N1.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Donald Trump went on Twitter to applaud his administration’s response to the coronavirus and shift attention to another pandemic that happened when Joe Biden was vice president.
The first U.S. case of a new H1N1 influenza virus (also called swine flu) was detected in April 2009, three months after the Obama administration began. The pandemic took a toll on Americans, with an estimated 60.8 million H1N1 cases and 12,469 deaths from April 2009 to April 2010.
Worldwide, it’s estimated the virus killed between 151,700 to 575,400 people during its first year. (By August 2010, the World Health Organization said the virus had largely run its course.)
Trump said Biden, a top Democratic presidential candidate, led an ineffective effort to combat the outbreak.
""Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!"" Trump tweeted March 12.
Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2020 
Trump previously falsely claimed the Obama administration ""didn't do anything about"" swine flu. How does his recent tweet line up with the facts?
He’s wrong about Biden’s role and omitted important context about his polling.

""Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people.""

Biden was the vice president, but he was not in charge of the Obama administration’s handling of the H1N1 pandemic. That responsibility mainly fell on the leaders of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Trump enlisted Vice President Mike Pence to helm the country’s response to COVID-19.)
Health policy experts told PolitiFact they did not recall Biden having a prominent leadership role. PolitiFact also reviewed archives of Obama’s public statements on H1N1 and found that Obama generally mentioned the leadership of department heads and of his homeland security adviser, not Biden.
RELATED FACT-CHECK: Trump wrongly blames Obama for limits on coronavirus testing
At the same time, Biden’s website mentions the Obama administration's record to make the argument to voters that he could manage the current response better. Biden’s coronavirus response plan says he ""helped lead"" the Obama administration’s response to H1N1 in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014. It does not offer further detail.

The H1N1 response ""was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!""

Neither the White House nor Trump’s campaign responded to our requests for information backing Trump’s claim.
If Trump was talking about public confidence in the federal government’s ability to handle outbreaks, he might have been referring to a Gallup poll taken Feb. 3-16. But he isn’t correct about its findings and ignores key context.
A lot has happened since Gallup asked a random sample of 1,028 adults how confident they were that the federal government would be able to handle a coronavirus outbreak. Trump’s ""78% approval rating"" could be alluding to the combined 77% who were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%). The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
Gallup in February said that the 77% figure showed a higher level of confidence than Gallup had found for previous health scares during other administrations.
But confidence in the 2009 H1N1 response was the second highest, not ""one of the worst on record."" The averages of two polls in 2009 showed that 67% of respondents were very confident or somewhat confident in the federal government’s ability to handle the H1N1 outbreak. Those two polls were released in May and August of that year, about a month and four months into the outbreak.
Public confidence in the federal government’s handling of the Zika virus, Ebola virus, and bird flu were lower than for H1N1.
Gallup’s February poll began days after the Trump administration announced restrictions on travelers who had been in China in the prior two weeks, and at that time, no one had died within the United States from the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
""This high level of confidence may be related to the fact that all deaths from COVID-19 have occurred abroad, rather than on U.S. soil,"" Gallup said in February.
By the time of Trump’s March 12 tweet, there were more than 1,600 coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 41 deaths.
Polling done after Gallup’s shows a drop in confidence in the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus. A Feb. 28-March 1 Morning Consult survey showed that 49% of voters approved of Trump’s response to the outbreak, down from 56% in a Feb. 24-26 survey — a decline fueled by drops among independents and Democrats. The poll surveyed 1,997 registered voters and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
Our ruling
Trump said, ""Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!
Biden was not in charge of the Obama administration’s H1N1 response. A Gallup poll in February — before any coronavirus deaths in the United States — showed that 77% of respondents had confidence in the administration’s handling of the outbreak. It ranked higher than averages of two 2009 polls on confidence in the Obama administration’s handling of H1N1. Public confidence in H1N1 was the second highest, not ""one of the worst"" or the ""lowest.""

Facebook posts","Italy’s overwhelmed hospitals are treating elderly COVID-19 patients as a lower priority




If Your Time is short





Italy, second only to China in the number of COVID-19 cases, hasn’t decided to stop treating elderly COVID-19 patients. 


But the elderly are a lower priority because they are less likely to survive, and hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus cases. 





See the sources for this fact-check




In Italy, beset by more cases of COVID-19 than any country but China, hospitals have been forced to make tough triage decisions and ration treatment.
But that doesn’t mean the country decided to stop treating elderly coronavirus patients. 
A post on Facebook made that claim on March 14, 2020.
""Italy has decided not to treat their elderly for this virus. That, my friends, is socialized healthcare,"" the post claimed.
It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
On the day of the post, Italy had recorded 17,660 cases of coronavirus and 1,268 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of deaths represented 58% of the 2,199 coronavirus deaths outside China, including 41 deaths in the United States.
By that point, Italy’s hospitals were faced with choosing which of the sickest patients should be treated, and priorities tended to exclude the elderly, who experts say are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19.
Triage is a common tool used in health care systems. For example, the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality promotes an algorithm for emergency department triage that divides patients into five groups — most urgent to least urgent, ""on the basis of acuity and resource needs.""
But with the exceptional situation presented by the coronavirus in Italy, special guidelines were developed for Italian health care professionals dealing with COVID-19.

By mid March, news organizations had already reported on how Italian doctors were being forced to choose which patients to treat — with the elderly getting a lower priority.
""There are now simply too many patients for each one of them to receive adequate care,"" The Atlantic reported. ""Doctors and nurses are unable to tend to everybody. They lack machines to ventilate all those gasping for air.""
The Atlantic also reported that COVID-19 guidelines that had been established by medical doctors from the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care:
""Informed by the principle of maximizing benefits for the largest number,"" the guidelines suggest that ""the allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care. ... It may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care.""
The New York Times, reporting from Rome, quoted Dr. Flavia Petrini, president of the college, as saying: ""No one is getting kicked out, but we’re offering criteria of priority. These choices are made in normal times, but what’s not normal is when you have to assist 600 people all at once.""
The Times also reported that Giorgo Gori, mayor of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Italy’s worst affected region, said that in some cases, the gap between resources and the enormous influx of patients ""forced the doctors to decide not to intubate some very old patients,"" essentially leaving them to die. 
""Were there more intensive care units,"" he added, ""it would have been possible to save more lives."" 
As of March 17, 2020, the latest World Health Organization update showed Italy with 27,980 cases and 2,503 deaths. That was second to China, which had 81,116 and 3,231. The United States had 3,503 and 58.

Facebook posts","No, not all of these photos are from the 1918 flu pandemic




If Your Time is short



• Five of the 11 photos are from the 1918 flu pandemic. Six are not.
 



See the sources for this fact-check




Women in gas masks, others with bags on their heads and stay at home posters. If posts on social media are to be believed, these images and more come from the 1918 flu pandemic.
""Photos from the 1918 flu pandemic,"" proclaimed one such recent Facebook post that contained 11 photos. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
PolitiFact conducted reverse image searches to determine the origins of the photos. Of the 11 photos, six bear no connection to the 1918 flu pandemic. Let’s take a look at those first.
What is on their heads?
The first photo features two women with what look like bags over their heads. According to the Associated Press, it was captured in November 1953.
""War surplus gas capes are used by Meriel Bush, left, and Ruth Neuer, in an attempt to dodge the eye-stinging effects of a low-hanging smog and smoke which enveloped Philadelphia for the second straight day,"" reads the AP’s caption.
Well-dressed ladies on street
A reverse image search located the image of masked women walking arm in arm on a stock photo website. On the site, the photo is described as, ""Ladies' fashion from 1913. New veil fashions, based on Turkish nose veils.""
When debunking claims that the photo was of the 1918 flu pandemic, AFP Fact Check’s bureau in Thailand contacted the German photo agency, Süddeutsche Zeitung Photo, which was listed as the photographer.
 ""The original picture description says that the nose veils were the fashion for ladies after the Balkan war,"" Süddeutsche Zeitung’s spokesperson told AFP in an email.
The Balkan Wars unfolded from 1912 to 1913.
Gas masks and a stroller 
A photo of women in gas masks tending to a stroller is from a June 1941 gas test during World War II, according to Getty Images.
""9th June 1941: A gas masked young mother attends to her child's pram gas mask during a surprise gas test in Kingston,"" reads the Getty Images photo description.
Quarantine telephone service
One of the images from the post is an advertisement for a Bell Telephone Co. ""People who are in quarantine are not isolated if they have a Bell Telephone,"" the ad reads.
Back in May, Snopes.com debunked the claim that this ad was connected to the 1918 pandemic. 
Versions of this ad existed as early as November 1910. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran an ad that was nearly identical, but with a different tag, ""The Bell Telephone Company of Missouri.""

The ad mentions ""quarantine"" and ""the sick,"" but there is no indication it is a direct reference to any particular illness.
‘Stay at Home’ ad
An image of an ad that encouraged people to stay home was created not in 1918, but in 2020.
""Stay At Home,"" the ad says. ""It has never been easier to save lives.""
Though the graphic illustration may appear vintage, it was made in March in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A French illustrator named Mathieu Persan made versions of the poster in various languages and posted them on Twitter. If you look closely, you can see his signature on the right side of the illustration.
Masked ladies chatting 
A photo of two women who appear to be visiting over a car window while wearing masks was taken in 1929, during a separate flu epidemic. 
""Two women wearing flu masks during a flu epidemic in 1929,"" reads Getty Images’ photo description.
The 1928-29 flu epidemic was studied by health professionals using data from the 1918 pandemic.
Photos linked to the 1918 flu pandemic
Here’s what we can tell you about the five photos that are actually from the 1918 influenza pandemic time period.


A reverse image search identified a photo of a woman wearing a mask as a Getty Images stock photo from February 1919. ""A woman wearing a flu mask during the flu epidemic which followed the First World War,"" reads Getty Images’ caption.


A photo showing a sign on a streetcar proclaims, ""Spit spreads death."" A reverse image search revealed the New York Times had used this photo as a feature image for a story about the 1918 flu. Crediting the photo to the Historical Medical Library of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, the Times caption reads, ""An anti-spitting sign posted on streetcar in Philadelphia, October 1918.""


An image shows rows of beds used for treating flu patients from the 1918 pandemic, according to Getty Images. The photo was featured in Wired and Business Insider stories about the visuals from the 1918 flu pandemic.


""All theatres closed until further notice at request of mayor,"" reads a sign behind a young boy. The photo was used in a story published by the Seattle Times in July. Credited to the Museum of History & Industry, the Times’ caption reads, ""A masked newsboy looks west outside the closed Pantages Theatre box office during the influenza pandemic of nearly 102 years ago. Likely, the photo was taken between Oct. 5 and Nov. 11, 1918."" It was also used in the museum’s webinar about the 1918 pandemic.


And a news announcement with a Red Cross nurse wearing a mask is legitimately from 1918, according to The Washington Post and The Guardian. ""A Red Cross nurse wears a gauze mask over her nose and mouth in this 1918 imaged published in the Illustrated Current News of New Haven, Conn.,"" the Washington Post reported in its description of the photo.

Ron DeSantis","Ron DeSantis advances questionable link between lockdowns and despair




If Your Time is short




There is not yet clear data supporting the position by Gov. Ron DeSantis that stringent restrictions such as stay-at-home orders and so-called lockdowns led to increases in suicides, substance abuse and overall despair.
Epidemiologists said that DeSantis was playing “loose with the facts” regarding COVID-19 mortality rates and that numerous factors beyond state policies play a role.




See the sources for this fact-check




For months, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has boasted about his state’s ""open for business"" strategy in dealing with COVID-19 and how it’s working better than so-called lockdown states.
Unlike in some other states, all Florida public schools are open for in-person learning, restaurants and bars have few restrictions, and the state has barred local governments from penalizing individuals for not wearing a mask in public.
In a recent rant against social network companies such as Facebook and Twitter, DeSantis suggested that states that had instituted heavy restrictions on residents experienced severe repercussions for residents without reducing the number of COVID-19 deaths.
""Lockdowns at the time of the pandemic were favored by the, quote, ‘narrative’ and so, in the name of, quote, ‘science,’ articles and posts warning against lockdowns were taken down and censored,"" said DeSantis. ""The result has been the destruction of millions of lives across America, as well as increased deaths from suicide, substance abuse and despair, without any corresponding benefit in COVID mortality.""
We wondered whether that was true. Have state restrictions done such significant harm without providing any boost in the fight against COVID-19 deaths? So we dug in.
Locking in on lockdowns
To reduce the spread of the coronavirus, states have enacted — and then sometimes relaxed or lifted — various restrictions, including mask mandates, limits on restaurant capacity, stay-at-home orders and bans on large gatherings.
DeSantis, a Republican, has bristled at such statewide orders, even resisting pleas from local officials in Florida and criticizing other jurisdictions for implementing them. He has consistently questioned their effectiveness. Late last year, for instance, he claimed that states with lockdowns had COVID-19 transmission rates twice as high as Florida’s. We rated that Half True.
We asked DeSantis’ office for any evidence supporting his more recent claim. The response reveals a mixed bag of information.
Check the data: Did Florida’s path lead to less ‘despair’?
To support the governor’s claim that other states have seen higher numbers of deaths from suicide, substance abuse and despair than Florida has during the pandemic, DeSantis’ office sent information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing ""all cause"" mortality rates increased slower in Florida in 2020 — coinciding with the pandemic’s first months through June 3 — over 2019 rates than in California and New York — two states that have opted for more regulations on public gatherings and mask-wearing. DeSantis’ analysis showed Florida’s rate rose 15% compared with 16% in California and 29% in New York.
But the ""all causes"" category goes far beyond deaths associated with suicide and drug abuse. It includes deaths from cancer, heart disease, lung disease and dementia, for example.
DeSantis’ office did not provide any data showing how rates of suicide and drug abuse in Florida compared with those in so-called lockdown states. It sent us a Miami Herald article that said in Florida, according to preliminary medical examiners’ statistics, 2,975 people died by suicide in 2020, down 13% from the previous year. But the article did not have nationwide data or figures from California or New York.
Concerning overdose deaths, DeSantis’ office did not provide specific information. However, health experts said the pandemic likely did increase opioid overdoses. But the latest, provisional CDC data on drug overdose deaths shows Florida’s numbers rising faster than the national average.
Comparing the 12-month period ending in June 2020, the period of time for which data is available, to the prior 12 months, Florida had a 34% increase in the rate of overdose deaths compared with a 20% national average among states. California had a 23% increase and New York had an 18% increase.
Meanwhile, federal suicide data reflecting the months in which the pandemic has transpired will not likely be available until 2022. Experts say that anecdotal evidence suggests a possible uptick in suicide rates during the pandemic. In addition, an online tool offered by the nonprofit Mental Health America to help screen for mental health issues showed a slight increase last year in people having suicidal thoughts.

“The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION recently reversed its stance on children getting the Covid vaccine.”












By Victoria Knight • June 24, 2021







Nonetheless, Paul Gionfriddo, the group’s CEO, said he knows of no studies showing that so-called lockdown states have higher rates of suicide than those with fewer restrictions.
Gionfriddo said DeSantis may think he is mitigating the harmful effects of loneliness by not limiting public gatherings. But loneliness is not the only reason people cite in considering suicide, he said. Grief, financial insecurity and other factors also play a role, he said.
John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit think tank, said it’s difficult to pinpoint the psychological impact of restrictions to reduce infection because rules vary by state and within states, and such regulations have been imposed and lifted at different times.
Auerbach said he knows of no evidence that links states’ COVID-19 restrictions to suicides or drug overdose deaths.
""There are many contributing factors to suicide and drug overdoses,"" he said. The pandemic itself is having the biggest effect on heightening people’s risk of dying from suicide and drug abuse — not the states’ different approaches to prevent the transmission of infection, he added.
""It is the underlying pandemic that is at the root of increased risks,"" Auerbach said.
Factoring in COVID-19 mortality rates
DeSantis also argued that statewide restrictions did not bring any corresponding benefit in limiting COVID-19 mortality.
We asked his office for evidence. They again pointed to the CDC increase in ""all cause"" mortality data that showed California’s rate was slightly higher than Florida’s. But those statistics cover all causes of death, and people are still dying of diseases and conditions besides COVID-19.
We then consulted three epidemiologists to get their take. They all said the governor was playing loose with the facts. They stressed varying factors that affect states’ mortality rates — from the weather to socioeconomic indicators to access to health services.
The epidemiologists pointed to the latest CDC data, which indicated that Florida’s COVID-19 mortality rate is higher than California’s and seemed to undercut DeSantis’ position that lockdowns have only hurt states.
As of Feb. 22, Florida ranked 28th in COVID-19 death rates while California ranked 33rd, according to the latest CDC data, as compiled by Statista.
""That would bolster the argument that restrictions are one factor involved in lowering death rates,"" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor of public health at Claremont Graduate University in California.
Numerous others also have an effect, Gatto said, so it is impossible to compare states using current data based on their strategies.
""I do think it is an oversimplification to make the assertion that the governor did without further study of the numerous variables involved, characteristics of the population, timing of interventions and the limitations of the data,"" she said.
Our ruling 
DeSantis said lockdown states have seen ""increased deaths from suicide, substance abuse and despair without any corresponding benefit in COVID mortality.""
The pandemic certainly has caused anxiety and distress across the country and state and local restrictions designed to tamp down on the coronavirus’s spread have also affected people’s financial and emotional wellbeing. But currently, no clear data supports DeSantis’ strongly worded claim. Researchers agreed that more research is necessary before such broad conclusions could be drawn. In addition, experts said that COVID-19 death rates vary by state and numerous factors beyond state strategies to combat the virus affect this metric.

Nasal swabs are preferred over mouth swabs as a more accurate way of testing for COVID-19.


There’s no evidence nasal swabs are used for “implanting something.”





See the sources for this fact-check




Could coronavirus testers be doing more than just testing with their nasal swabs?
An ominous Facebook post suggests that instead of just retrieving a sample with a swab to test for the presence of COVID-19, testers are ""implanting something.""
The post, shared 320,000 times, argues it this way:
""1) Modern Science can take a swab from the inside of your cheek and do a COMPLETE DNA MAPPING. 2) If this COVID-19 is so CONTAGIOUS that tiny microscopic particles of Saliva in your MOUTH could spread out in excess of 6 feet and you need to wear a mask to stop the Spread. WHY not Swab the inside of your HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS MOUTH ? 3) When you tilt your head back are you sure that is just a Q-Tip going 6 inches up your nose ? - Is it possible that instead of retreiving a SAMPLE, they could actually be IMPLANTING SOMETHING ? ? ? Again DNA can be done at home through the mail with simple MOUTH SWAB but the HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS COVID-19 in your MASK COVERED MOUTHS can't be tested with a Mouth Swab ? ?""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Tests that extract samples from where the nasal cavity connects with the throat are considered the most accurate, and there is no evidence of testers implanting anything.
How the test works
Here’s how the test is described by Dr. Micah Bhatti, an infectious-diseases professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston:
""The person conducting the test will insert a long stick with a very soft brush on the end — kind of like a pipe cleaner — up your nose and twirl it around for a few seconds. The soft bristles will collect a sample of secretions there for analysis. The swab has to go pretty far back, because cells and fluids must be collected from along the entire passageway that connects the base of the nose to the back of the throat to get a really good specimen.

Similar conspiracy theories have emerged about the tests and have been debunked:
We rated as Pants on Fire a claim that ""the spot where they are ‘getting a sample’ for the COVID-19 test is called your Blood-Brain Barrier."" The swabs do not go anywhere near the blood-brain barrier, the name given to the unique protective properties found in blood vessels that supply blood to the central nervous system. And there is no evidence that getting a COVID-19 test could cause anything more serious than temporary irritation.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
One user commented in response: ""Can someone fact check this?""
We did. Here’s what our fact-check finds: 
With a few exceptions, you must have a Social Security number to receive the $1,400 stimulus payments for yourself. (The exceptions are for dependents who have an adoption taxpayer ID and for people who are married to members of the military.)
Among noncitizens, generally, only those who are authorized to work in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security can get a Social Security number, including legal permanent residents.
The vast majority of people in the country illegally don’t have a Social Security number, so they wouldn’t qualify for payments for themselves, even if they met the income limits.
However, their dependents who have Social Security numbers will qualify for $1,400 payments.
Income rules for eligibility
Whether you are eligible for a direct payment, and how much, depends on the adjusted gross income you reported in the latest tax return you filed, either for 2019 or 2020. (Adjusted gross income is annual gross income minus certain deductions such as contributions to retirement accounts, alimony paid and educator expenses.)

Single tax return filers whose adjusted gross income was up to $75,000 are eligible for the full $1,400. A head of household whose adjusted gross income was up to $112,500 also gets the full amount. A couple who filed joint tax returns and had an adjusted gross income of up to $150,000 would get $2,800.
Taxpayers who meet those income criteria also get $1,400 per eligible dependent (including older children and adult dependents).
People who earned slightly more than the income caps still get a payment for themselves and their dependents, but not the full $1,400 per person.
Restrictions on eligibility
H.R.1319 says ""any nonresident alien individual"" is not eligible for the $1,400 stimulus check. That term refers to people who are not U.S. citizens or lawful residents.
And the law says recipients generally must have a Social Security number to qualify. 
Some foreign nationals and others who don’t have a Social Security number are issued an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number so they can pay U.S. income taxes. They are not eligible themselves for stimulus checks. But their dependents who have Social Security numbers, such as a U.S.-born child, would qualify.
If a couple files a joint tax return — one using an ITIN and another using a Social Security number — only the spouse and dependents who have Social Security numbers are eligible for a payment. (Under the rules of the first stimulus check offered, U.S. citizens were ineligible for a check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an ITIN.)
As was the case with previous stimulus payments, when a married couple files a joint return and at least one spouse is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces during the tax year for which the return is filed, the full $2,800 credit is allowed (if they meet income criteria) even if only one spouse has a Social Security number.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claimed: ""Illegal aliens will receive $1,400 stimulus checks.""
Under the law, with some exceptions, only people who have a Social Security number can receive a $1,400 stimulus check for themselves. The vast majority of immigrants who are in the country illegally don’t have a Social Security number.
The law would still pay $1,400 for each of their dependents who has a Social Security number.

Rick Scott","GOP treats Trump-era projects in pandemic bill as Democratic pork




If Your Time is short




The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act includes money for a bridge between New York and Ontario, and a San Francisco Bay Area rapid transit extension.
Both projects were backed by the Trump administration before the bill was written




See the sources for this fact-check




Republican opposition to the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief and economic stimulus package centers mainly on the argument that it contains wasteful spending. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., picked out two examples during a CBS News interview.
""Less than 1% of this bill is about the vaccine,"" Scott said March 1. ""It's about a bridge for Chuck Schumer, a tunnel for Nancy Pelosi. This is about paying back liberal politicians. It's not about getting our country back to normal again.""
The 1% figure for vaccines is about right. The $20 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act for vaccines and their distribution might sound like a lot, but set against more than $1 trillion for unemployment and stimulus checks to individuals and aid to state and local governments, it looks small.
Scott goes a bit further and uses infrastructure money in the bill to paint most of the package as misdirected political pork. He is repeating a Republican talking point.
The legislation does include money for the examples he picked.
First, the bridge: The bill would give $1.5 million to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corp. ""to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus by conducting the operations, maintenance and capital infrastructure activities of the Seaway International Bridge,"" which connects New York state and Ontario.
New York is Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s home state. And it would be easy to suggest his fingerprints are on this part of the bill, except for one key detail.
The Trump administration first proposed spending this money.
In May 2020, the Transportation Department asked for funds to make up for toll revenues that had ""dramatically decreased"" due to decreased traffic from the pandemic, the New York Daily News reported. The Canadians had put in their share of emergency relief, and the U.S. was going to do its part.
The U.S. side of it sits in the district of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a key defender of former President Donald Trump during his first impeachment.

As for the tunnel, while the bill doesn’t name a project in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s California district, it does have $1.425 billion for federal capital-investment grants to mass transit. Some of that is destined for a 6-mile extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which connects San Francisco, Oakland and surrounding suburbs. 
But like the bridge money, this project also dates back to the Trump administration. In August 2019, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced $125 million for the extension. 
Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said the current bill funds the larger mass transit program, and this project is among those that already won approval. He also noted that while the transit system serves the entire region, this work takes place 50 miles from Pelosi’s district.
Scott spokesman McKinley Lewis noted that Democrats chose to include these elements in the bill, and the origins of them don’t matter.
In any case, set against the bill’s total price tag, these elements amount to a fraction of a fraction of 1% of the total bill.
For context, by the House Republicans’ calculations, nearly 50% of the bill goes toward what they consider legitimate COVID-19 and economic relief. 
Past pandemic relief bills have included both health and economic stimulus elements. Most Republicans voted for those. Scott’s record is mixed. He voted for the March CARES Act and against the December supplemental aid package.
Our ruling
Scott said the $1.9 trillion relief package is ""about a bridge for Chuck Schumer, a tunnel for Nancy Pelosi.""
The bill has money both for a bridge between New York and Ontario, and for a mass transit project in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is difficult to tie them solely to Schumer and Pelosi because the Trump administration backed both efforts well before the current bill took shape. 
Scott cherry-picked and mischaracterized a couple of examples of the bill’s overall spending. Even Republicans say about 50% goes toward helping households and businesses deal with the pandemic’s damage.

Instagram posts","Instagram post overlooks FDA sign-off on COVID-19 vaccines




If Your Time is short





The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to three COVID-19 vaccines.


The clinical trial results and other requirements for emergency use are little different from what is required for final approval.





See the sources for this fact-check




An Instagram post from a Tampa Bay nurse casts doubt on the value of the COVID-19 vaccines.
""So, you injected the non-FDA-approved experimental agent, but you still have to wear a mask and social distance?"" the March 30 post asks. ""Does that imply the jab, the mask and the social distancing don’t work? #sodumb""
Here, we check the claim that any of the COVID-19 vaccines rely on a ""non-FDA-approved experimental agent."" FDA is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The claim’s main flaw is it fails to reflect that the FDA authorized the vaccines after months of clinical testing.
Emergency Use Authorization
In a public health emergency, there’s a defined process to expedite the use of promising drugs. The rationale is that during a crisis that poses an immediate threat to peoples’ lives, it is unethical to stick with the conventional approval process.
The new drugs must be fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. Drug makers have to submit reports on the outcomes and effects on every participant. The chemistry behind the drug, details of the manufacturing process, and the details of the quality controls in place are also required.
The data has to show that the drug is both safe and effective.
The FDA issued emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines. While that falls short of a final approval, Northwestern University professor of medical ethics Seema Shah said that’s a distinction with little difference.
""An emergency use authorization has a slightly lower bar to cross than full approval, but has come about after a comprehensive review of the data,"" Shah said. ""Most of the steps cut out by the FDA have to do more with paperwork than with stringency of review.""

Drug makers must continue to monitor and report any negative outcomes that follow vaccination. That ongoing process underlies the dispute over how to describe the vaccines.
A battle over words
While vaccine skeptics often use the term ""experimental agent"" when referring to the vaccines, the FDA refers to the drugs as ""investigational vaccines.""
The agency’s authorization letters tell drug makers to file ""periodic safety reports at monthly intervals"" under an ""investigational new drug"" tracking system.
The manner in which the words are applied ""is linked to interpretation,"" said Ross Upshur, head of the Division of Clinical Public Health at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto.
""Experimental agent"" emphasizes uncertainty. ""Investigational"" links back to the clinical trials that preceded the emergency authorization.

An Instagram post described the COVID-19 vaccine as a ""non-FDA-approved experimental agent.""
While the vaccines await full FDA approval, the FDA formally authorized their use after reviewing months of data involving tens of thousands of clinical trial participants.

Evaluation of the vaccines continues and drug makers must file monthly reports on any adverse outcomes.

Turning Point USA","Conservative group's meme distorts Nevada’s chloroquine restrictions




If Your Time is short





A Nevada emergency regulation restricts the prescription of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients in outpatient settings, but not in hospitals and emergency rooms. 


Gov. Steve Sisolak signed the order on the recommendation of state health officials, who said there is the potential for stockpiling the drug.


Federal regulators say the effectiveness of chloroquine in treating COVID-19 is anecdotal, and more research and clinical trials are needed.





See the sources for this fact-check




A malaria drug that could potentially be used to treat COVID-19 has become the latest political touchpoint of the coronavirus pandemic.
A meme published on Facebook by Turning Point USA, a conservative group that targets high school and college students, claims Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak bucked doctors’ recommendations and outlawed the use of chloroquine to treat the coronavirus.
""WHAT?! Nevada’s Leftist Governor Has Banned The Use Of An Anti-Malaria Drug That Might Help Cure Coronavirus!"" reads the caption on the meme, which was posted March 25, 2020. ""Big Government Is Deadly!""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 10,000 times.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
We’ve seen a lot of confusion about chloroquine, which is also prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, and its application to COVID-19. So we wanted to check out Turning Point USA’s post.
While Sisolak has limited the prescription of chloroquine for coronavirus patients, the move isn’t a ban — and his order didn’t contradict doctors’ advice about the drug, as this post suggests. Health officials and federal regulators have urged caution when using the drug to treat COVID-19 until more research is done. The order is also intended to prevent hoarding, so patients who need the drug still have access to it. 
Regulation exempts hospitals, emergency rooms
Sisolak has restricted prescribing chloroquine for COVID-19. But the order has an exemption for doctors issuing the drug to patients in hospitals and emergency rooms.
On March 24, Sisolak, a Democrat, signed an emergency regulation that safeguards the supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which is sold under the brand name Plaquenil and as a generic. The order prohibits doctors in outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing the drugs for COVID-19 treatment. It also limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies.
""While the two drugs serve necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada’s own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said during a press conference. ""The emergency regulation is aimed at preventing the hoarding of the drugs so those that actually need them can have access to them.""
Sisolak’s order came after President Donald Trump touted the potential of chloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients during a March 19 press conference, saying it could be a ""game changer"" and a ""tremendous breakthrough.""
RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic
News outlets first reported that Sisolak’s action was a ban on using chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. But that coverage missed a key fact: there is an exemption.
A spokesman for Sisolak told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas that the regulation allows for a ""chart order for an inpatient in an institutional setting,"" meaning that doctors in hospitals and emergency rooms can still prescribe chloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The Associated Press, for one, corrected its initial story on the order to reflect that exemption.
So while Sisolak’s order does restrict the prescription of chloroquine in Nevada, it does not constitute an outright ban, as Turning Point USA’s meme claims.
Health officials pushed for chloroquine restrictions 
Nevada health officials advocated for restricting chloroquine prescriptions given the potential for hoarding. That’s different from Turning Point USA’s post, which makes it look like Sisolak disregarded physicians’ recommendations by issuing the emergency regulation.

In a March 20 letter, the state’s Board of Pharmacy noted that ""safety and efficacy have not been established"" for the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19. Its guidance allowed for the use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus patients, but only as treatment — not prevention.
""In the effort to prevent the stockpiling of these medications, the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy is restricting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,"" wrote J. David Wuest, executive secretary of the board.
RELATED: Fact-checking COVID-19 prevention, treatment myths
As several news outlets have reported, physicians around the country have started to fraudulently prescribe themselves chloroquine in order to hoard it for their families. That hoarding has led to drug shortages in some parts of the country, affecting patients who take chloroquine regularly to treat conditions like lupus and arthritis.
Still, Sisolak’s order was quickly criticized by organizations like Turning Point USA and politicians like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who tweeted March 25 that the governor was ""trying to score political points against Trump.""
Effectiveness against COVID-19 is unproven 
Turning Point USA’s meme makes it seem like chloroquine is a potential cure for the coronavirus. But the science is not settled.
Trump’s March 19 remarks on chloroquine were based on a recent French study that found the malaria drug could be effective in treating patients with COVID-19. The authors, which include researchers from universities in France and Vietnam, concluded that the use of chloroquine sped up healing, and the effect was reinforced by adding azithromycin, an antibiotic. 
But the study was based on only 20 people in France with COVID-19, and public health experts quickly put the findings into perspective.
On March 19, the Food and Drug Administration published a statement in which it said that while ""there are no FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19,"" the agency is investigating whether chloroquine ""can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms.""
During a press conference on March 20, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also tempered expectations for the malaria drug, saying the French study was based on anecdotal evidence.
RELATED: A 100% COVID-19 cure? No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal
""The information that you're referring to specifically is anecdotal; it was not done in a controlled clinical trial,"" Fauci told a reporter. ""So you really can't make any definitive statement about it.""
Based on that limited data, chloroquine is recommended for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug is ""currently under investigation in clinical trials.""
We reached out to Turning Point USA for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
Our ruling
Turning Point USA said in a Facebook post that Sisolak banned the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 against doctors’ recommendations.
Nevada’s emergency regulation restricts the prescription of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients in outpatient settings, but not in hospitals and emergency rooms. Sisolak signed the order on the recommendation of state health officials, who said the safety and efficacy of chloroquine in treating the coronavirus is unproven, and there is a potential for stockpiling the drug.
While the Facebook post touts the potential of chloroquine in curing COVID-19, federal health officials and regulators have said that, as of now, the effectiveness of the drug is anecdotal. More research and clinical trials are needed before drawing a conclusion.

Pennsylvania







Brian Fitzpatrick","No, the World Health Organization didn't ‘miss’ the coronavirus pandemic




If Your Time is short




A Jan. 14 tweet saying that Chinese authorities found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus led a Pennsylvania congressman to accuse the World Health Organization of failing to alert people about the pandemic.

 
Later in January, the WHO announced that in fact there was evidence of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus and declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern. 

 
Experts say the WHO was slow to designate the coronavirus a pandemic and that the organization should have been more skeptical of information it received from China before it sent that tweet but that accusing the WHO of missing the pandemic altogether goes too far.




See the sources for this fact-check




Speaking on the ""Fox Across America"" radio show, U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick accused global health officials of failing earlier this year to warn the world about the coming coronavirus pandemic. 
""For the World Health Organization, the international entity whose sole responsibility it is to alert the world of global pandemics, to miss this, is a huge problem,"" Fitzpatrick, a Republican, told radio host Jimmy Failla. 
We wondered whether Fitzpatrick’s stinging criticism was fair and what exactly the WHO told the public about the coronavirus in the pandemic’s earliest days. 
Fitzpatrick was referring to a Jan. 14 tweet from the WHO, which stated that ""preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.""
A timeline of events on the WHO’s website about its actions on Jan. 14 offers a different account of what the organization told the public that day, indicating deeper concern than what was reflected in the tweet.
The timeline states that on that date, a WHO official noted in a press briefing that there ""may have been"" limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus between family members and that there was ""a risk of a possible outbreak."" 
Nearly a week later, according to the timeline, WHO investigators visited Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus originated, and learned that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission, a major development that contradicted the Chinese government claims cited in the organization’s Jan. 14 tweet. 
Another week after that, the WHO’s director-general declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" a rare designation meant to convey the extraordinary and serious nature of an unfolding health crisis. 
On March 11, the WHO gave the coronavirus another ominous designation – global pandemic. 
Will Kiley, a spokesman for Fitzpatrick, said the two-month delay between the Jan. 14 tweet and the pandemic declaration justifies the congressman’s criticism, especially given evidence the virus had spread beyond China as early as Jan. 20.  
The Jan. 14 tweet accurately reflects what Chinese officials told the WHO at the time – that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. But the group should have questioned the accuracy of China’s claim before issuing the tweet, said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He and other infectious-disease experts did.

A PolitiFact story on the WHO’s response to the pandemic written after President Donald Trump announced the United States would halt its financial support for the group found no credible evidence of human-to-human transmission prior to mid-January. 
""There were questions, but no solid confirmation,"" Boston University global health researcher Davidson Hamer told PolitiFact in April. 
But by Jan. 20, there had already been 200 cases, three deaths and three countries impacted, Adalja noted in a Jan. 20 blog post on the coronavirus, citing a paper published a day earlier by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. It was not until Jan. 22 that the WHO acknowledged for the first time that there had been human-to-human transmission. 
Adalja added that the WHO was slow to declare the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern, and very slow issuing the pandemic declaration. Still, he said, accusing the WHO of missing the pandemic altogether goes too far. 
""When it comes to these declarations, there’s a lot of politics and diplomacy at play,"" Adalja said. 
Michael LeVasseur, an epidemiologist at Drexel University, also said he does not think the WHO missed the pandemic. 
""I don’t think anything was missed,"" LeVasseur said. ""Missed implies that they weren’t involved very early on, which they were.""
Fitzpatrick also claimed that alerting the world to global pandemics is the WHO’s ""sole responsibility."" But the group actually has a much broader mission to promote public health in parts of the world with limited access to health care. 
Our ruling
During a conservative talk radio interview, Fitzpatrick accused the WHO of missing the pandemic, citing a Jan. 14 tweet in which the organization reported Chinese assurances that  there was no human-to-human transmission of the virus. 
Experts argue that the WHO was slow to acknowledge human-to-human transmission, declare the coronavirus a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" and label it a pandemic. 
But the agency was actively gathering and disseminating information about the virus in the weeks prior to the official pandemic declaration, and it’s possible to interpret public statements made during this time as cautious, not reckless. Saying the WHO missed the pandemic altogether goes too far. Also, Fitzpatrick’s claim doesn’t acknowledge the WHO’s work promoting public health.

If Your Time is short





Some college students on spring break have ignored the public health warnings to not congregate in large groups, but experts say young people are vulnerable to coronavirus, too.


The CDC reported that between mid-February and mid-March, 20% of the hospitalizations for coronavirus were for patients age 20-44 and 18% were age 45-54.


The CDC cautioned that the data is preliminary and limited.





See the sources for this fact-check




With plenty of college students congregating for spring break, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warned on Twitter that coronavirus is not only afflicting the elderly.
""We only have 3 months of information on  #Covid_19,"" Rubio tweeted March 19 to his 4 million followers. ""We have created the perception that younger people have nothing to worry about. We now need to stop saying that. In the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35. In France half of those in the ICU are under 65.""
 
Rubio’s overall point that younger people are vulnerable has merit. But his U.S. number is wrong.
For the record, his numbers on France were correct. The head of France’s national health agency said March 15 that 50% of people in intensive care are under 60 or under age 65. But we wanted to focus on the U.S. numbers.
Experts warn that U.S. hospitalization data is preliminary, which means the numbers could change in the coming weeks as testing becomes more widespread.
Data shows younger people hospitalized, but older groups more frequently
One day before Rubio’s tweet, the CDC reported there were 508 patients known to have been hospitalized as a result of coronavirus. The hospitalizations represented 12% of U.S. cases between Feb. 12 and March 16.
The data did not include an age group breakdown specific to those under 35. What the CDC did report was that 20% of those hospitalized were ages 20-44, and 18% were 45-54. If we add up those two age groups, we get a total of 38%. We asked Rubio’s spokespersons if that was the 38% he was referencing, but we did not get a response.

Major news outlets including the New York Times and NPR used that 38% statistic to point out that younger populations are also vulnerable to coronavirus. That’s an important message amid spring break, as some college students have ignored the recommendations to avoid large gatherings and have poured onto beaches in Florida, leading many counties or cities to close beaches. 
The CDC data shows that the elderly have the highest fatality rate.

The March 18 report by the CDC states that the figures are based on preliminary data and include several limitations, including that data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, were missing for between 9% and 53% of the cases. Also, further follow-up is needed to determine the outcomes among active cases and data on other risk factors, including if patients had underlying health conditions.
""At the current point, the data is too fluid to have confidence in the accuracy of any statement regarding how COVID-19 affects different age groups,"" said Volker Mai, a University of Florida epidemiologist.
However, Mai said, it’s important to clear up any misperception that young people are immune from the disease. Younger populations are at risk of contracting COVID-19, especially young people with underlying conditions.
""Since we are just at the start of the epidemic here, we don’t have enough data to make strong conclusions about age-specific risk of serious illness and/or death in the U.S. yet,"" said Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, in an email.
The reason, Prins said, is a lack or lag in testing
Our ruling
Rubio tweeted ""in the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35.""
We could not find any current data that matches Rubio’s tweet. It is possible that he was citing widely reported data that included people up to age 54.
The CDC reported that 20% of the hospitalizations were ages 20-44 and 18% were 45-54. But the data is preliminary, so it’s challenging to draw conclusions at this stage about the ages of people hospitalized. 
Rubio’s office didn’t get back to us but we have to wonder if the mistake in his tweet amounted to a simple transcription error.

Sean Hannity","Hannity wrong that health care system is ready as is for coronavirus




If Your Time is short





Experts said all evidence points to the U.S. being short on hospital beds, ICUs and ventilators, assuming COVID-19 continues to spread. 


The U.S. could take any number of actions to increase the number of hospital beds, supplies and medical staff available.


Social distancing and other measures to slow the virus’s spread are meant to shrink the peak number of cases so hospitals don’t get stretched past their capacity.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity celebrated the White House’s response to the novel coronavirus in a recent TV monologue, saying the U.S. health care system is ready for the virus.
""We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario,"" Hannity said on his TV show March 16. ""The president and his task force confirmed they are. Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals and ultimately, like I said, we must prepare for the worst, pray for the best.""

That contradicts the warnings of public health experts, who have been sounding alarm about the shortage of ventilators, intensive care unit beds and medical professionals and encouraging Americans to practice social distancing as a way of preventing hospitals from being overrun.
Hannity is wrong to say the U.S. has everything it will need, experts said. U.S. hospitals might be able to deal with the number of patients today — although experts we spoke to disagreed on whether that was the case — but the situation will likely look different as it evolves.
""We don’t have nearly enough hospital and ICU beds if there is a surge of cases,"" said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. ""There is no basis for his assertion.""  
""Even a mild surge of COVID patients will stress our ICUs as they have never been stressed before,"" added Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. 
The available data suggests that U.S. hospitals are not as well-equipped as Hannity claimed.
A surge of cases could overwhelm hospitals
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. That ratio puts the U.S. behind other countries — such as China and Italy — that have struggled to keep up with the spread of COVID-19.
That doesn’t bode well for the U.S. response to the coronavirus. As of March 16, Italy has seen more than 24,700 confirmed infections and over 1,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals can’t handle the influx of patients, forcing doctors into difficult decisions.
In a March 12 op-ed in the New York Times, health policy experts wrote that if 5% of the country catches COVID-19, there will be enough serious cases to overwhelm the health care system.
""If we follow the curve that Italy has followed, in two to three weeks we will no longer have adequate supplies of any of those necessary resources,"" Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, told us.
A March 17 analysis from the Harvard Global Health Institute, ProPublica and the New York Times shows how many beds would be filled in parts of the United States if, over the next six, 12 or 18 months, the coronavirus infects 20%, 40% or 60% of the country. 
The projections show that many U.S. cities won’t have enough hospital beds to meet the number of sick patients in need, assuming the virus continues to spread and nothing is done to increase the hospitals’ capacity. Some states will be worse off than others.
In the worst-case scenario — where 60% of the population gets sick within six months — the U.S. would need seven times the number of available hospital beds it currently has, the analysis found. Even in a moderate scenario where 40% is infected over 12 months, many cities such as Washington, D.C., would still need to significantly expand hospital capacity.
Jha, who worked on that project, told us its findings show Hannity’s claim to be wrong.
 
Another analysis from USA Today found that ""there could be almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed"" — and possibly as many as 17 patients per bed.

By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







That examination said the 6-to-1 ratio was a ""conservative"" estimate based on the assumption that all the hospital beds in the U.S. are currently empty. They’re not.
""Our ICUs are currently stretched thin by flu, and we have shortages of nurses and doctors in many parts of the country,"" Toner told us.
A February report Toner worked on at Johns Hopkins said the U.S. has approximately 46,500 ICU beds in total. 
If the coronavirus spreads at a moderate pace, then 1 million Americans could be hospitalized and 200,000 Americans would ultimately need an ICU, the report said. A more severe scenario could put up to 9.6 million Americans in the hospital and 2.9 million in need of ICUs.
A separate Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security report identified about 160,000 ventilators in the country, though not all are full-featured. That includes tens of thousands of ventilators in hospitals nationwide and thousands more in an emergency federal stockpile. 
But in 2018, the group estimated that a moderate pandemic similar to the 1957 or 1968 influenza viruses would put about 65,000 people in need of ventilation, and a severe pandemic like the 1918 flu would require ventilators for some 742,500 people.
Not all COVID-19 patients will need treatment at the same time, of course. Aaron Carroll, professor at the Indiana School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Times that a key metric is ""the difference between the total number of people who might get sick and the number who might get sick at the same time."" But states and doctors are worried about shortages.
Social distancing, shutdowns and other preventative measures to slow the spread are meant to shrink the peak number of cases so hospitals don’t get stretched past their capacity.
 
""That is why hospitals are cancelling all elective surgeries, planning to expand capacity as much as possible, and even getting ready to make very difficult, battlefield-style triage decisions if it comes to that,"" Wynia said. ""There is an enormous storm coming, and our best meteorologists can’t be sure exactly how big it will be, when it makes landfall, or where it might hit hardest.""
The message from the White House
President Donald Trump has said the federal government has ordered more equipment and instructed governors to purchase supplies directly if they can get them faster on their own.
""We’ve ordered massive numbers of ventilators,"" Trump said during a March 17 briefing. ""By any normal standards, we have a lot of respirators, ventilators.""

Trump said the Army Corps of Engineers is ""ready, willing and able"" to retrofit its facilities and build new field hospitals to care for more patients, saying they could do so ""very rapidly.""
In the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence called on construction companies to donate their masks to local hospitals, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the coronavirus task force, said Americans should cancel elective surgeries to ""free up hospital beds and space.""
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said March 18 that Trump has pledged to dispatch a Navy hospital ship to New York Harbor to accommodate patients there.
Our ruling
Hannity said, ""Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals.""
That might be true if the U.S. stopped the coronavirus from spreading any further. But given the country’s likely trajectory, experts said all evidence points to the U.S. being short on beds, ICUs, ventilators and medical professionals.
The U.S. will need to take steps to slow the spread and expand hospital capacity if it wants to keep its health care system from being overrun by the likely uptick in cases.

Joe Biden","Biden’s criticism of Trump administration vaccine contracts too broad to be accurate




If Your Time is short




President Joe Biden said the Trump administration didn’t contract for enough vaccine to cover all U.S. adults — an estimated 255 million.

 
Under Trump administration contracts, the U.S. had agreed to buy at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine, enough to vaccinate 550 million people.

 
Those agreements, though, included vaccine candidates still in development. By the time Trump left office, his administration had contracted for enough of the authorized vaccines to inoculate 200 million people. 




See the sources for this fact-check




During a March 2 news conference on the COVID-19 pandemic, President Joe Biden claimed that former President Donald Trump’s administration did not ensure there would be enough vaccines for the American public. 
""When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America,"" said Biden. ""We rectified that."" 
Biden then announced he was using the Defense Production Act to facilitate a partnership between two competing drug companies: Merck had agreed to help manufacture the recently authorized Johnson & Johnson vaccine. 
The move, he said, would accelerate the timeline for the availability of vaccines to the American public: ""We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,"" he said, two months earlier than he had previously projected. 
It’s been a common political message since the Biden administration took office that the initial vaccine rollout under Trump was ""chaotic."" PolitiFact previously rated a claim by Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, that the Trump administration left no vaccine plan behind as Mostly False. 
So, we thought it was important to check whether Biden was going too far in alleging that the Trump administration hadn’t contracted for enough vaccines to cover the American public. Let’s see what the contracts, which are public documents, say. 
The Operation Warp Speed contracts and FDA’s process
As part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration entered into contracts with multiple drugmakers. The contracts were generally signed while potential vaccines were still in clinical trials. 
Experts told us this was smart, because the Trump administration didn’t know what vaccines from which drugmakers would work, how effective they would be or how quickly they could be produced. 
""That was the whole approach of Operation Warp Speed,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Not knowing which one would cross the finish line, the Trump administration took a portfolio approach and invested in multiple vaccines."" 
Here’s what the Trump administration’s initial contracts called for drug makers to supply to the U.S. government: 

Pfizer-BioNTech: 100 million doses (2 dose regimen)
Moderna: 100 million doses (2 dose regimen) 
Johnson & Johnson: 100 million doses (1 dose regimen) 
AstraZeneca: 300 million doses (2 dose regimen) 
Novavax: 100 million doses (2 dose regimen)
Sanofi-GlaxoSmithKline: 100 million doses (1 or 2 dose regimen)

In total, the amounts agreed to under these contracts equal about 800 million vaccine doses, or enough for more than 400 million people. 
The U.S., based on U.S. Census estimates, has around 328 million people, of whom about 255 million are older than 18. (Vaccines are not yet authorized for children.) 
So it appears that the Trump administration’s contracts with drugmakers did cover enough doses to vaccinate the entire U.S. adult population — and then some. By that measure, Biden’s statement is inaccurate. 
An important point to remember, though, is that these contract numbers don’t necessarily represent deliverable vaccines. The contracts represent early promises. There were still important hurdles that had to be cleared before these possible vaccine candidates could be a reality. 
Kevin Gilligan, a senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, a firm focused on pharmaceuticals, said once drugmakers develop a vaccine, they must test it through clinical trials with humans and amass enough data to show the vaccines are safe and effective and cause minimal side effects. 
The data is then presented to the Food and Drug Administration, which decides whether the vaccine should be authorized for emergency use. Granting an emergency use authorization means the vaccine can then be distributed to the public. 
Until recently, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were the only two that had reached that point, gaining authorization on Dec. 11 and 18 respectively.

“The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION recently reversed its stance on children getting the Covid vaccine.”












By Victoria Knight • June 24, 2021







The Trump administration announced Dec. 23 that it would buy an additional 200 million doses in total of both companies’ vaccines. 
The caveat worth noting: The real numbers were lower
A Biden administration press official told KHN that the president was referring only to orders for the authorized vaccines. ""When the Trump Administration was in office, there were only two approved vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) and the Trump Administration had not contracted for enough of them to vaccinate all Americans. They only had 400 million doses of these authorized vaccines, which is only enough for 200 million Americans. Upon coming into office, one of our first steps was to ensure that we had enough supply secured for every American. We were prepared from Day 1."" 
On this point, the Biden White House is correct. The U.S. government had in place agreements to buy 400 million doses of the authorized vaccines, which were both two-dose vaccines — not enough for the entire U.S. adult population. 
It’s also true that five days after Biden became president, he announced his administration had reached agreements with Moderna and Pfizer to buy a combined additional 200 million doses. That purchase was finalized on Feb. 11 and brought the total U.S. supply to 600 million doses of authorized vaccines, or enough to vaccinate 300 million people. 
In addition, on Feb. 27, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was authorized for emergency use. Under the Operation Warp Speed contract, J&J is supposed to provide 100 million doses to the U.S. by the end of May, but the company is reportedly behind on production. 
The Biden administration’s move to get J&J to team up with Merck to achieve its production goal will increase vaccine supply. 
But, is it fair for Biden to blame the Trump administration for not buying more of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines once they became authorized for emergency use? 
The answer to that isn’t clear-cut, said the experts. 
""It’s not totally fair to say the prior administration didn’t purchase enough, since they did move to purchase more doses after the vaccine was authorized,"" said Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""I think the question is should they have purchased it earlier?"" 
The New York Times reported on Dec. 7 that before Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was shown to be highly effective in clinical trials, the company had offered the U.S. government the option to buy additional doses, but the Trump administration declined. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar disputed the news report, saying during a TV interview that Pfizer hadn’t agreed to a production amount or delivery time for the additional vaccine, so he couldn’t agree to the deal: ""I'm certainly not going to sign a deal with Pfizer giving them $10 billion to buy vaccine that they could deliver to us five, 10 years hence. That doesn't make any sense."" 
James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a non-governmental organization that obtained copies of COVID-19 government contracts, agreed that once it was clear the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were likely to receive FDA authorization, the Trump administration could have taken action to make competing drug companies increase their vaccine manufacturing capacity in the way Biden did with Merck and J&J.  
""The U.S. could have forced technology transfer between companies, which meant they would have been assured of additional vaccine manufacturing capacity,"" said Love. ""The agreements we have now about scaling manufacturing are coming pretty late actually. It takes several months to get stuff up and running."" 
But Gilligan noted that the Biden administration had the advantage of hindsight. ""Biden inherited the success of vaccine development done under Trump and then expanded on it,"" said Gilligan. ""And the Biden administration has the benefit of looking back at what was done well and what wasn’t and making the appropriate corrective changes. Hindsight is 20/20."" 
Overall, there are questions around whether the Trump administration could have acted more quickly to buy doses or increase vaccine manufacturing capacity. And the Biden administration has certainly taken significant measures to expand supplies. 
But it’s stretching the truth to say the Trump administration hadn’t contracted for enough Covid vaccines to inoculate the U.S. adult population. 
Our ruling
Biden said the Trump administration ""had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America.""
While Trump was still in office, his administration had agreements in place to buy 400 million doses of authorized vaccine, or enough to inoculate about 200 million people. That’s less than the U.S. adult population. 
However, KHN/Politifact reviewed the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed contracts, and found that those included enough vaccine doses that, once cleared for use by the FDA, could inoculate about 550 million people — more than double the U.S. adult population. 
Biden’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores facts that would give a different impression.

If Your Time is short



•  The post copies information from a federal database of reports on adverse events that happen after vaccination. The agencies that maintain the database warn that the reports do not indicate whether an adverse event is linked to or caused by the vaccine. 
•  Vaccine experts describe the database as an early warning system to flag issues that may need further study. To establish causation, researchers examine if an adverse event is significantly more common in a population of vaccinated people than in non-vaccinated ones. 
• Safety data involving tens of thousands of people have shown the approved COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and effective. ​

Learn the Risk, an anti-vaccine group, recently published a post on Facebook with a list of people who died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. 
""AGE 25. MALE. Vaccinated 12/22/2020. Found unresponsive and subsequently expired at home on 1/11/2021. Moderna vaccine,"" reads the first of almost 30 entries featured in the Feb. 9 post. 
These entries are copied from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a national vaccine safety surveillance program set up by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration that records health issues that arise after vaccinations in the U.S. 
 

 
The implication: That the reports show that COVID-19 vaccines contributed to the deaths of dozens of people, as young as 24.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Vaccine skeptics commonly cite VAERS reports as evidence that vaccines are lethal or otherwise dangerous. But the agencies that run the tracking system warn that the reports shouldn’t be misinterpreted. Search results on the system come with this caveat: ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.""
Without further study, vaccine experts say, it’s not possible to tell whether a particular adverse event is linked to the vaccine or merely occurred afterward as a coincidence, and they cautioned against drawing inferences from reports published in the database. 
Without that context, posts like this one risk misleading people by implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to these deaths.
The limitations of the VAERS
An adverse event is a health problem that arises after someone has received a vaccine. VAERS accepts and records any and all reports of adverse events, and the government acknowledges that ""reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.""

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







To illustrate the shortcomings of the database, one physician reported that a vaccine had turned him into the Incredible Hulk, the comic-book character. Both the CDC and the physician confirmed to PolitiFact that his report was initially accepted and entered into the system as an adverse event. 
Since VAERS doesn’t show whether an adverse event was caused by the vaccine or occurred coincidentally, it’s generally not useful on its own for assessing whether a vaccine poses a risk to human health, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta.
Instead, vaccine experts said, VAERS should be seen as a ""hypothesis-generating"" system, which helps scientists decide which negative side effects to test for.
For example, in 1999, VAERS reports helped physicians realize that a rotavirus vaccine was associated with a form of bowel obstruction called intussusception, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. After physicians monitoring the system noticed a cluster of reports detailing intussusception in young vaccinated children, they commissioned additional studies comparing vaccinated patients with non-vaccinated patients. These studies found that the incidence of intussusception in vaccinated patients was significantly higher than in a control group. The vaccine was pulled from the market. 
In this case, VAERS was used as an early warning system that prompted scientists to commission more comprehensive studies. The reports weren’t themselves used to make a determination about vaccine safety. 
""A system like VAERS can never answer the question of whether a vaccine causes a particular outcome,"" said Offit. ""The only way to establish causation is through a study involving a control group.""
The COVID-19 vaccines now being rolled out to the public were subject to these kinds of studies to determine whether they caused serious health issues. Tens of thousands of people participated in clinical trials last year to demonstrate to regulators that the COVID-19 vaccines were safe. To receive FDA emergency-use authorization, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna had to follow up with at least half of participants for at least two months after they received their vaccinations.
Our ruling
A Facebook post from an anti-vaccine group shows a list of people who died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, implying that the vaccine caused or contributed to those deaths. 
The claim relies on reports from a federal tracking system of adverse events occurring after vaccinations. The agencies that maintain that system warn that the reports should not be used to draw conclusions about whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event. To establish causation, experts look beyond isolated data points to studies of large groups of people to see if a negative symptom is more prominent in vaccinated people than in non-vaccinated ones. 
The COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people.

Bill Cassidy","How much did New York’s revenue suffer in the pandemic year?




If Your Time is short



• New York State saw its revenue decline by 1.5% during calendar year 2020. But its fiscal year runs from April to March.
• The calendar year figure that Cassidy cited includes nearly three months of 2020 with relatively normal, pre-pandemic economic activity, distorting the budget picture. 
• State budget officials have already projected larger revenue declines over the full fiscal year.

How has New York state fared in collecting revenue during the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil? 
Not so badly, according to Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who said recently that New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has been exaggerating the fiscal hit to his state.
In a Feb. 7 interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press on Feb. 7, Cassidy was asked about what actions the Senate needs to take to help state and local governments experiencing fiscal shortfalls in the wake of the pandemic.
Cassidy acknowledged that some states have faced budgetary difficulties, but said others have not, including Democratic-run states such as New York. ""New York, for all of their complaining, Gov. Cuomo's complaining, has only had a 1.5% decrease in revenue,"" Cassidy said.
The remarks came amid skirmishing between the parties over President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. The bill is designed to boost the response to the coronavirus pandemic and aid the economic recovery. 
Biden’s proposal envisioned $350 billion in state and local government aid, but many Republicans have been skeptical of aiding cities and states without more conditions.

Has New York’s fiscal hit really been that modest?
Ty Bofferding, Cassidy’s director of communications, pointed to a report by the financial institution J.P. Morgan that showed that in the calendar year 2020, New York had an aggregate tax revenue decline of 1.5% compared with 2019.
While Cuomo’s administration did not dispute the 1.5% figure, they argue that the calendar year figures are less useful for tracking the pandemic’s budgetary impact than the fiscal year figures, which run from April 1 through March 31. In 2020, January, February and part of March occurred before the pandemic hit.

""Comparing calendar years, as the chart the senator is referencing does, fails to recognize the impact of the pandemic on state revenues,"" said Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the New York state Division of the Budget. ""Almost the entirety of the first quarter of the calendar year 2020 was un-impacted by the pandemic and growing robustly.""
In other words, the state argues, the calendar-year totals undercount the fiscal harm from the pandemic.
""Unlike the federal government, New York State must balance its budget, and it must do it on a fiscal year basis,"" Klopott said. ""We can’t change the timing.""
The J.P. Morgan report, which focused on advice to investors in municipal bonds, cautioned that its conclusions are ""based on the current data, and are not indicative of future revenues, particularly given the uncertainties on the progress of the pandemic.""
Meanwhile, New York state has projected a significantly larger revenue shortfall for the full fiscal year.
A baseline budget from January 2020 projected state revenue of $87.9 billion for the year ending March 31, 2021, said Laura Schultz, executive director of research at the State University of New York’s Rockefeller Institute of Government.
But by April 2020, after the impact of the pandemic started to become clear, the state revised its projection to $77.7 billion. That would be an 11.6% decline from the earlier projection, and a 6.2% drop from what was collected in the previous fiscal year. 
Those numbers are significantly larger than the 1.5% decrease, though final revenue figures won’t be available until after the end of the fiscal year.
Our ruling
Cassidy said that ""New York, for all of their complaining, Gov. Cuomo's complaining, has only had a 1.5% decrease in revenue"" due to the pandemic.
New York state saw revenue decline by 1.5% in calendar year 2020. However, the state’s budget is based on a fiscal year that runs from April 1 to March 31, and the calendar year figure Cassidy cited includes nearly three months of relatively normal, pre-pandemic economic activity.
This makes it a misleading indicator of the pandemic’s budgetary impact. In fact, state budget officials have already projected larger revenue declines for the full fiscal year.

If Your Time is short



• The post accurately cites several provisions that are in the coronavirus relief bill passed in late March.
• But it’s misleading to suggest the financial needs of a laid-off waitress aren’t addressed in the bill.
• An unemployed waitress would get both a $1,200 check and a $600-a-week increase in unemployment benefits.



See the sources for this fact-check




It didn’t take long after the enactment of a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill for critics to blame Democrats for larding it with unnecessary spending.
One Facebook post that was shared at least 15,000 times features a photograph of a smiling, young waitress.
The text says: ""I lost my job. But I'll sleep better knowing: $25 million of (coronavirus) relief aid went to the Kennedy Center. $350,000,000 went to refugee resettlement. $75 million went to PBS. $25 million went to congressional salaries and expenses. Thanks, Democrats. It couldn't have happened without you.""
Some of this text in the post accurately describes elements included in the final version of the bill. However, it also includes some inaccuracies, and the broader depiction of the bill — in which laid-off workers get nothing, at the expense of special interests — is significantly skewed.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
We’ll take a look at the text, piece by piece.
""$25 million of (coronavirus) relief aid went to the Kennedy Center."" 
This is accurate. The funding would go for such purposes as ""deep cleaning,"" maintenance, telework upgrades, employee compensation, rent and utilities for the performing arts center. The Kennedy Center is a federal entity funded by ticket revenue and congressional appropriations, so receiving funding through a congressional bill isn’t unusual.
In a statement, the Democratic House leadership said that the Kennedy Center has lost more than $20 million in unrecoverable costs from canceled performances and has lost the ability to generate revenue from ticket sales in the interim. ""Without the assistance in the bill, the Kennedy Center would become completely insolvent and potentially unable to reopen,"" the statement said. 
""$350,000,000 went to refugee resettlement.""
If ""refugee resettlement"" is supposed to mean resettling refugees in the United States, that’s not entirely accurate. The bill doesn’t say specifically where the $350 million earmarked for ""Department of State migration and refugee assistance"" will go, but much of it may end up as humanitarian assistance to other countries as they grapple with internal displacement of individuals and families due to the virus.
Indeed, the Trump administration’s State Department touted its role in this regard as recently as a March 27 news release.
""The U.S. Government is leading the world’s humanitarian and health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the release said, citing an initial investment of $274 million for other countries in need, plus the World Health Organization and UNICEF, prior to passage of the relief bill. ""We are mobilizing all necessary resources to respond rapidly, both at home and abroad.""
""$75 million went to PBS.""
This is broadly accurate. The funding is for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn funds public broadcasters such as PBS.
The bill provides ""stabilization support"" for stations seeing declines in non-federal revenues. ""Public media stations are the backbone for most communities’ emergency alert, public safety, first-responder and homeland-security services,"" the Democratic leadership statement said. ""If stations are forced to cut jobs, reduce content and services, or close, the nation’s ability to deliver emergency alerts will be significantly diminished.""
As with the money for the Kennedy Center, it is standard practice for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to receive its funding from congressional legislation.
""$25 million went to congressional salaries and expenses.""
Social media users might think this refers to a pay boost for lawmakers, but we’ve previously rated that assertion Pants on Fire.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Hollander said there is $25 million for the House in the stimulus to support the chamber’s ""capability to telework,"" including equipment purchases and improvements to the computer network.
There is also money to reimburse the staff of the House Child Care Center, cover the costs of food service contracts and pay the House sergeant-at-arms.
Separately, the Senate is slated to get $10 million from the stimulus; $1 million will go to the sergeant-at-arms’ office to remain available for coronavirus response, while $9 million will be reserved for ""miscellaneous items,"" including reimbursement for workers at the Senate Employee Child Care Center.
None of the money in the bill would go toward paying lawmakers anything more than their current salary level.
""Thanks, Democrats""
While some of these provisions mirror elements of a bill offered by House Democrats, that bill never received consideration. Instead, the Senate and the House passed a bill drawn up by leading senators of both parties. 
The Senate passed the bill 96-0, while the House approved it by a voice vote, a method used for widely supported measures. Because almost all members of both parties approved the bills, Republicans and Democrats alike deserve whatever credit or blame comes from the bill.
The implication that laid-off workers get no assistance
The biggest misleading element of the post is the notion that the laid-off waitress will get nothing out of the bill. That couldn’t be more wrong.
First, assuming she earns less than $75,000 a year, she’ll get $1,200 tax-free from the government, no strings attached.
Second, the bill includes historically generous add-on amounts to state unemployment payments.
The bill sets aside $260 billion to increase state unemployment payments by $600 a week, or the equivalent of more than $30,000 a year. If the state gives you $400 a week, a fairly typical amount, then you’ll be getting a total of $1,000 a week, or the equivalent of $52,000 a year. (If you made less than this before you lost your job, you’ll actually be earning more than you did previously, at least during the four months provided for in the bill.)
The bill also incentivizes states to waive waiting periods for receiving benefits, and provides funds for states to lengthen the time limits for receiving their unemployment benefits by 13 weeks.
Meanwhile, in a landmark move, the bill recognizes that gig workers — from freelancers to Uber drivers — need economic assistance in times like these. So they will qualify for the enhanced unemployment provisions in the new bill. 
Our ruling
A Facebook post shows a waitress saying, ""I lost my job. But I'll sleep better knowing"" that the coronavirus relief bill included funding for the Kennedy Center, refugee resettlement, PBS, and congressional salaries: ""Thanks, Democrats.""
While the post oversimplifies some of those provisions, they are indeed part of the bill. 
However, the post gives the strong impression that the bill offers nothing to laid-off workers, and that’s flat wrong. Every American earning less than the income caps will get a $1,200 check, and anyone who starts drawing unemployment payments will see those topped up by additional federal payments of $600 a month.
Also, the bill that was passed received almost blanket support from both Republicans and Democrats.

Greg Abbott","Abbott exaggerates COVID-19 concerns about migrants entering US




One day after Gov. Greg Abbott announced he would lift the statewide mask mandate and allow all businesses to open to 100% capacity, the governor turned his attention to the coronavirus spreading along the Texas-Mexico border. 
""The Biden Administration is recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities,"" the governor said in a March 3 tweet. ""The Biden Admin. must IMMEDIATELY end this callous act that exposes Texans & Americans to COVID."" 
According to a March 2 NBC News article, 108 asylum seekers in Brownsville had tested positive for COVID-19 by rapid testing while waiting to board busses destined for other U.S. cities. The city of Brownsville conducts these tests on migrants after they are released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As of March 2, the 108 positive cases represented about 6% of all tests the city had been administered since the city began testing on Jan. 25. While the city can refer infected migrants to non-governmental organizations for quarantining, it does not have the authority to stop people from traveling throughout the country. 
The NBC News article was picked up by Fox News and the New York Post the next day and prompted Abbott's March 3 tweet about COVID-positive migrants endangering Texas communities.
Abbott continued this line of attack in the subsequent days, first during a TV interview with KPRC-TV in Houston, then in an interview with CNBC, and again in another tweet in which he said the state denied the federal government’s request for help in screening, testing and quarantining migrants. 
""The unconscionable act by the Biden Administration of releasing COVID-positive illegal immigrants in our state puts the lives of Texans and Americans at risk,"" he tweeted. ""Border security is strictly a federal responsibility.""
In a Tuesday news conference at the border, Abbott urged the Biden administration to increase U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding, which is responsible for testing and detaining anyone crossing the border.
A negative coronavirus test is required by the federal government before entry to the U.S. While U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducts screenings, ""suspected COVID-19 cases are referred to local health systems for appropriate testing, diagnosis, and treatment,"" the agency said in a statement.  
Felipe Romero, a spokesperson for the city of Brownsville, confirmed that the city was rapid testing each person Border Patrol dropped off at the city’s bus terminal. The 108 positive cases reported by NBC News on March 2 had climbed to 204 Tuesday, or about 12% of the total number of people tested.  
Romero said that there are two categories of migrants who are being released to the city’s bus terminal: asylum seekers entering after the repeal of the Trump administration’s Remain in Mexico policy, and those who have been apprehended at the border and allowed to remain in the country pending immigration court hearings, a policy derogatorily described by critics as ""catch and release."" 
Let’s look closely at each category to determine the accuracy of Abbott’s tweet.  
Biden policies allowing migrants to remain in the U.S.
In February, the Biden administration announced that it was dismantling many of the immigration policies put in place by former President Donald Trump. The first phase of reform began by processing the 25,000 asylum seekers who had been forced to remain in Mexico under Trump’s Migrant Protection Protocols.

On Feb. 19, federal authorities began processing up to 300 people per day at three different border crossings — two in Texas, in Brownsville and El Paso, and one in California, according to the Associated Press.  
Because Abbott’s statement focuses on the release of ""hundreds of illegal immigrants"" in Texas, this fact-check focuses on the crossings in Brownsville and El Paso. While the city of Brownsville reported 108 positive cases among migrants released by Border Patrol, the city of El Paso said that zero positive cases have been identified through its rapid testing program. El Paso’s tests are being supplied by the city and administered by non-governmental organizations, a city spokesperson said. 
The second major policy shift releasing migrants in Texas communities is the reintroduction of the Obama-era policy that allows asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting court dates. That policy was suspended by the Trump administration in 2018. The revived policy allows some families who are apprehended by Border Patrol to be released in the U.S. as they await their asylum proceedings. However, not all apprehended migrants are awarded this privilege; many are expelled to their origin countries.  
While asylum seekers formerly held under the remain in Mexico policy are processed in specific communities, those who are released under the revived Obama-era policy could be released anywhere along the border. However, the number of tests administered to people released under this policy is unknown and, according to Border Report, there are concerns that not all are being tested before they travel elsewhere in the U.S. to await court dates.  
It’s unclear what actual numbers form the basis of Abbott’s claim that ""hundreds of illegal immigrants"" carrying COVID-19 are being released in Texas. A spokesperson referred us to the 108 migrants in Brownsville reported by NBC News and did not respond to questions asking how Abbott arrived at his estimation of ""hundreds.""  
‘Illegal immigrants’ vs asylum seekers 
Abbott’s statement mischaracterizes the status of migrants who are being released into U.S. communities by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 
""Illegal immigrants"" are migrants who have entered the country without legal permission. All of the migrants being released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, on the other hand, have applied for asylum and have a legal claim to remain in the U.S. while they await their asylum proceedings.
Using the two terms interchangeably is inaccurate, said Andrea Meza, director of family detention services for Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES. 
""These folks are asylum seekers, so criminalizing them based on their manner of entry, which is not related to their legal ability to seek asylum, is misleading,"" Meza said. 
Our ruling 
Abbott said that the Biden administration is releasing ""hundreds of illegal immigrants"" infected with COVID-19 into Texas communities.  
A spokesperson said that the claim was based on news articles reporting that 108 migrants released by Border Patrol had tested positive in Brownsville. While that number has risen beyond 200 positive cases since then, it was well below ""hundreds"" at the time of Abbott’s tweet.  
Abbott also mischaracterizes the status of the migrants being released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection by calling them ""illegal immigrants."" They are asylum seekers holding notices to appear in court.

Ron Johnson","Johnson falsely claims Wisconsin didn’t account for in-person hours when allocating federal stimulus




If Your Time is short





The three federal stimulus packages passed since the start of the coronavirus have allocated about $2.4 billion for Wisconsin schools


For the most part, under federal rules, the money will be allocated to districts based on an existing formula centered on the number of low-income students.


But 10% of the money is distributed at the discretion of the state.


Republican lawmakers have moved to distribute it based on the number of in-person hours of instruction for the 2020-2021 school year at the request of state lawmakers





See the sources for this fact-check




As public school students in Milwaukee and Madison return to the classroom for the first time in more than a year, administrators across the state are still trying to figure out how to spend federal stimulus money earmarked for schools. 

 
How the money is allotted to schools across the state has become a hot topic -- especially among Republicans, who think more money should be given to schools that were quick to return to an in-person teaching model last fall. 
U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin took to Twitter to criticize what he called a ""shotgun approach"" for directing stimulus money to schools. 


""No distinctions are being made between Wisconsin schools that remained closed to in-person learning, and those that have been re-opened for months,"" he tweeted April 8, 2021. 
So Johnson claims Wisconsin didn’t allocate more money to schools that were already back in person over those still choosing to make use of virtual schools. 
Is it true? 
Lawmakers put in charge of 10% of funding 
Johnson’s office did not return multiple requests for more information. But Johnson did include a link to a news report in the tweet, so we have some additional context. 
The link was to an April 7, 2021 story from the Wisconsin State Journal about the $2.4 billion in federal stimulus aid allocated to the state under the three stimulus plans passed since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. 
Let’s look deeper at the story, and the issue as a whole.
The story notes that 90 percent of the money is being allocated to schools based on the number of low-income students in each district. In that sense, Johnson has a point -- the formula is not based on how much time schools spent in the classroom, or in remote learning.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







But the state does not have discretion in how to split up that money. How it is spent is governed by the federal stimulus measures that passed, two under Republican Donald Trump and one under Democrat Joe Biden.
Chris Bucher, communications specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, said that portion of the funding was allocated using the Title I formula, which takes into account the percentage of children from low-income families, based on Census data.
States were only given discretion on how to distribute the remaining 10 percent, which amounts to about $65.5 million in Wisconsin.
And that is where Johnson’s claim is off.


The state Department of Public Instruction developed a plan for the funding, which went to the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee for approval. That committee, like the Legislature, is controlled by Republicans. Gov. Tony Evers could veto the spending decision, but the committee could still override his veto. 
For its part, the finance committee added a component to the DPI plan that requires the total number of in-person instructional hours provided during the 2020-21 school year be taken into account when the money is distributed. That would favor districts that went back in person early over others that didn’t, such as Milwaukee Public Schools and Madison Metropolitan School District.
District-by-district allocations for the in-person schooling-based funding have not yet been decided, according to an April 5, 2021 summary from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.
To comply with the new formula, the department is planning to collect data on the number of in-person days of school at the end of the school year, Bucher said. 
Our rating 
Johnson claimed that when distributing federal money, ""No distinctions are being made between Wisconsin schools that remain closed to in-person learning, and those that have been re-opened for months."" 
But lawmakers in Wisconsin did put some restrictions on money sent to school districts based on how many days of in-person schooling took place during the 2020-21 school year. Federal funds, however, were not distributed in that way.

Charles Schumer","Fact-checking Chuck Schumer’s claim that Republican bill says ‘no medical malpractice suits’




If Your Time is short





The bill does not prohibit the filing of medical malpractice lawsuits, but it does set strict standards that must be met for a case to succeed. The standards could restrict the number of cases filed, experts said.


Although the bill refers to “coronavirus-related medical liability action,” the definition in the bill for “coronavirus-related health care services” is broad enough that it could apply to cases that were not directly COVID-19 related.





See the sources for this fact-check




Sen. Chuck Schumer rejected a coronavirus relief bill proposed by Republicans in the Senate, calling it extreme and ""a giveaway to corporate interests."" Schumer said the proposal focused on protecting businesses, schools and hospitals from liability.
""You know what's in this bill? No medical malpractice suits until 2024, even if they're not COVID-related,"" said Schumer in a July 28 interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. ""What it says is, if a employer—""
""Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, really?"" Hayes asked.
""That's in the bill, yes,"" Schumer said. ""It's in the bill. It's amazing.""
Is that true?
PolitiFact examined the bill and asked law professors for their review of it to determine if any aspect of the bill did what Schumer claimed.
What Schumer said was ""in the bill"" is not actually in the bill. The bill does not explicitly ban the filing of lawsuits until 2024. Language does, however, make cases more difficult to succeed, experts said. Does the bill extend to non-COVID-19 related cases?
""It doesn't seem that it's intended to apply to medical malpractice suits that don't relate to non-COVID-19 related care,"" said via email Michelle M. Mello, a law professor at Stanford Law School. But certain definitions and wording in the bill support Schumer’s interpretation, she said.
Specifics of the bill
Schumer’s claim is based on a bill introduced by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that’s part of a package promoted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. McConnell has argued that the bill does not provide immunity from lawsuits and that it still allows for accountability for gross negligence and intentional misconduct. The bill would extend to health care services provided from December 2019 to October 2024, or the date when the national emergency over the coronavirus ends.
A spokesperson for Schumer said that while the bill cites ""coronavirus-related medical liability action,"" it also gives a broad definition of what constitutes as ""coronavirus-related health care services.""
Here’s how the bill defines coronavirus-related health care services:

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021









The ""for any purpose"" phrase in that definition ""would enable the preemption"" of medical malpractice lawsuits even if the health care services are not directly related to COVID-19, said Justin Goodman, a spokesperson for Schumer. ""Because the provider can be expected to say that the pandemic impacted their decisions and activities for all services they provided,"" he said.
Mello, of Stanford Law School, offered this scenario: ""Suppose I come to a hospital clinic for chemotherapy, and the hospital is so overwhelmed and distracted with its COVID care and surge preparations that they don't staff the chemo service at normal levels and something important gets missed in my care — the hospital could argue that my injury fits the definition.""
The hospital could say that care was suboptimal because it had diverted resources and attention to COVID-19, Mello added.
Drew Brandewie, a spokesperson for Cornyn, argued that the ""for any purpose"" wording in the bill is irrelevant to Schumer’s claim. ""Nothing in the bill, including that provision, preempts or bars a lawsuit from being filed — which is what Sen. Schumer said,"" Brandewie said.
Law experts said there were provisions in the bill that could reduce the number of suits filed, including a standard for negligence that’s higher than what state laws commonly require.
""The bill only permits liability for the most egregious misconduct,"" said David C. Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown Law. Plaintiffs would have to prove that a health care provider intended to hurt them, he said.
In the evidence-gathering process, people seeking to sue must also show that information requested from a health care provider ""equals or exceeds the burden or cost"" placed on the health care provider. That provision and the one-year limit for filing claims, can also challenge a plaintiff's ability to file claims, experts said.
When Cornyn introduced his bill, he said that as states reopen, health care workers, businesses, and schools faced ""a second pandemic of frivolous lawsuits threatening to bankrupt them.""
What might be the effect of his bill if it becomes law?
There would be extremely few COVID-19-based medical malpractice lawsuits and nearly zero frivolous ones, said Charles M. Silver, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who has studied medical malpractice litigation in Texas.
""The impact of the bill will be to prevent the few plaintiffs with very strong negligence claims from collecting compensation,"" Silver said.
Silver disagreed with Cornyn’s premise that health care providers were getting lots of frivolous lawsuits. Medical malpractice lawsuits are expensive and hard to win, even when clients have strong claims, Silver said. ""The single most validated finding about medical malpractice litigation is that the system routinely sends victims with valid claims home empty-handed or, at least, under-compensated,"" Silver said.
Our ruling
Schumer said of a Republican coronavirus relief bill, ""You know what’s in this bill? No medical malpractice suits until 2024, even if they’re not COVID related.""
Schumer was imprecise and inaccurate describing a provision in the bill.
Despite what Schumer said, the bill does not prohibit the filing of medical malpractice lawsuits. It does set strict standards that must be met for a case to succeed. The standards also could restrict the number of cases filed, experts said.
Regarding the bill's impact on lawsuits not related to COVID-19 care, some experts say the language is broad enough to have a chilling effect on all types of medical malpractice lawsuits.

Donald Trump","Trump ad takes Fauci out of context




If Your Time is short





A Trump campaign ad uses an out-of-context quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci told CNN he did not consent to being in the ad and felt his words were out of context.


The full context of the quote shows that Fauci was talking about the White House coronavirus task force and the mobilization of the federal government more generally when he said “I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more.”


The ad does not show the date of Fauci’s remark. The comment came during a March 22 interview on Fox News. The U.S. has recorded millions of coronavirus cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths since then.





See the sources for this fact-check




A new campaign ad from President Donald Trump uses an out-of-context quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, to tout Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 214,000 Americans.
""President Trump tackled the virus head-on, as leaders should,"" the narrator of the ad says, before panning to Fauci to hammer home the point.
""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more,"" Fauci is shown saying. 

The comment from Fauci was in reference to the White House coronavirus task force and the broader government response, not to Trump. It's also almost seven months old. In a statement to CNN, Fauci said he felt his words were taken out of context.
The 30-second spot, titled ""Carefully,"" highlights Trump’s recent bout with the coronavirus and claims the U.S. is ""recovering"" from the pandemic. The ad was uploaded to YouTube Oct. 10, the same day the U.S. reported its highest number of new COVID-19 cases since mid August.
The ad also flashes clips of Trump wearing masks — a measure he has repeatedly criticized and taken sparingly in public settings since his first time wearing one in public in July. 
Fauci’s comment was clipped from a March 22 interview with Fox News host and radio personality Mark Levin. The ad gives the impression that Fauci was talking specifically about Trump when he said, ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more."" 
But that’s misleading, as other fact-checkers and news outlets have noted — and as Fauci said to CNN. Taken in full context, Fauci was actually speaking about the workload facing the White House coronavirus task force at the start of the pandemic and the scale of the federal government’s mobilization as U.S. cases began to flare.
""The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials,"" Fauci told CNN, adding that he’s never publicly endorsed a political candidate.

By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







Asked about the ad’s use of Fauci’s remark, a Trump campaign spokesperson told PolitiFact the ad was talking about the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus, and so was Fauci. 
Another campaign official told Business Insider, ""It’s the president’s coronavirus task force.""
Levin did ask Fauci if he had ""ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat"" as the coronavirus. Here’s Fauci’s response, with the relevant quote in bold:
""Well, we've never had a threat like this, and the coordinated response has been — there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think, is one of them. I mean, we're talking about all hands on deck. I, as one of many people on a team — I'm not the only person — since the beginning that we even recognized what this was, I have been devoting almost full time on this, almost full time. I'm down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. I'm connected by phone throughout the day and into the night. When I say night, I'm talking 12, 1, 2 in the morning. I'm not the only one. There's a whole group of us that are doing that. It's every single day. So, I can't imagine that, under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more.""
Fauci did not mention Trump by name in his answer, although he did go on to mention the ""very timely decision on the part of the president"" to restrict travel coming in from China while talking about mitigation efforts that could be used to slow the spread.
The interview came on March 22, when the U.S. had recorded roughly 34,800 confirmed cases and about 570 deaths from the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world with more than 7.7 million cases and 214,000 deaths logged to date.
The Trump campaign ad’s message of a nation bouncing back from the pandemic is at odds with more recent comments from Fauci. 
Speaking virtually with American University on Oct. 6, Fauci said the U.S. is facing ""a resurgence of the wave we began with"" and that ""the models tell us if we don’t do what we need to in the fall and winter, we could have 300,000 to 400,000 COVID-19 deaths.""
Fauci also called the White House event with Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, a ""superspreader event."" Trump announced that he tested positive for the coronavirus days after the event, which featured little social distancing or mask wearing. The White House has not said how Trump contracted COVID-19.
The ad says Trump is ""recovering from the coronavirus."" The White House physician said Oct. 10 that Trump is ""no longer considered a transmission risk,"" but he did not say whether Trump was still experiencing symptoms or whether he had tested negative for the virus, per NPR.
Our ruling
A Trump campaign ad claims Fauci said of Trump’s pandemic response, ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more.""
The ad’s use of Fauci’s quote is misleading. Fauci made the comment nearly seven months before the ad was released, and he was not talking about Trump. He told CNN he did not consent to being in the ad and felt he was taken out of context.
The full context of the quote shows that Fauci was talking about the White House coronavirus task force and the mobilization of the federal government more generally.

Roy Cooper","Cooper overstates ventilator access problem




If Your Time is short




North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said some COVID-19 patients have died because they couldn't access a ventilator or bed in an Intensive Care Unit.
Studies have shown that mortality rates rise when hospitals are overwhelmed, and some news articles suggest that has happened during the pandemic.
However, the American Hospital Association and other experts say they're not aware of specific cases where the lack of a ventilator or ICU bed directly contributed to someone's death.




See the sources for this fact-check




North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper says one of his goals is to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. 
While that may be a noble cause, Republicans are questioning a claim he made during a recent briefing.
""In some of these other states, some of their deaths can be attributable to the fact that they were having a hard time getting an ICU bed or a ventilator to a patient,"" Cooper said during a press conference on Aug. 13.
Is it true that some people have died because they had trouble accessing a ventilator, or a bed in the intensive care unit?
It’s true that more patients die at hospitals that are overwhelmed, as studies demonstrated even before the onset of the current pandemic. The Cooper administration also cited news articles where doctors said they worried about having enough resources to provide optimum levels of care.
But there’s little documentation of COVID-19 patients dying specifically because they couldn’t access a ventilator or ICU bed.
Lack of specific reports
At the onset of the pandemic, medical experts worried that there wouldn’t be enough ventilators to save patients who had severe symptoms of COVID-19. The virus primarily affects the lungs and ventilators are designed to help patients breathe.
The availability of ventilators became a political issue, with some governors saying the Trump administration didn’t provide their states with enough of the machines.
PolitiFact investigated the issue of ventilator access, finding in late April that it hadn’t become the nationwide problem health experts and medical professionals feared. Officials from 30 states told PolitiFact that they weren’t aware of any cases where their hospitals couldn’t provide ventilators to COVID-19 patients.
At the time, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association said the organization wasn’t aware of any patient dying because they couldn’t access a ventilator. 
Presented with Cooper’s quote from August, the AHA spokesman said nothing has changed.
""To the best of our knowledge, a ventilator has been available for every patient that needed one. So nothing has changed since we said the same thing in April,"" AHA spokesman Colin Milligan said.
PolitiFact North Carolina reached out to other experts quoted in the April fact check.
‘Hushed rumors’
Eric Toner is a senior scholar of internal and emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He previously said he ""would not be surprised if we find out later that some tragic triage choices had to be made.""
We contacted Toner again and asked if he’s aware of anyone who died because they couldn’t access a ventilator.

""I do not,"" he said. ""There are hushed rumors but nothing that I can cite or that anyone will openly admit to.""
Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, was also quoted in PolitiFact’s April article. He told us that any evidence of such deaths are likely to be anecdotal, and not necessarily something that’s documented.
""If your ICU is full, you’re going to try to make the best of it. You’re likely going to try to treat them in a step-down unit,"" Wynia said. ""You’re not going to find anyone who says we openly discussed this with the family and says ‘I’m sorry, we’re out of beds and ventilators.’""
Low resources can affect a patient’s level of care, he added. ""It’s something that no one wants to say, and for good reason. The reality is when a healthcare system is completely overrun, it’s not able to deliver services at its normal quality.""
When contacted by PolitiFact, the Cooper administration provided links to news stories where hospital officials worried about resources running out. They also provided links to studies that tied resource shortages to mortality rates.
What Cooper said
A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that COVID-19 patients had higher survival rates at bigger hospitals, which tend to have more resources than small hospitals. Dr. David Leaf, who works in Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, explained the findings to WBUR in Boston:
""Patients who were admitted to hospitals with fewer than 50 ICU beds— so, smaller hospitals — had a more than threefold higher risk of death than patients admitted to larger hospitals.""
A study of patient outcomes in Wuhan, China, found that the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) rooms had a significant impact on how long a patient lived, according to Contagion: Infectious Diseases Today. A July story in the Harvard Business Review used data from Germany and Italy to emphasize the need to relocate patients when ICU’s reach full capacity.
Despite what the studies say, we struggled to find news stories about specific people who died waiting for an ICU bed or a ventilator.
A March New York Times story reported that some have died inside the emergency room while waiting for a bed. Doctors told the Times that some patients were found dead in their rooms while doctors were busy helping others.
A Buzzfeed article from April quoted several doctors who attributed deaths to a lack of resources. ""There’s a list about six [types of] patients that do not get put on a vent. ‘It makes no sense, they’re going to die soon anyway, so let them die’ — like that’s the crazy thought process,"" one doctor said.
In July, Newsweek reported that a 70-year-old woman died less than a week after allegedly being turned away from two Florida hospitals. Also in July, CBS reported on a judge in Starr County, Texas, who said on Facebook that a lack of resources left a local hospital with the responsibility of choosing to help and ""who is sent home to die.""
Our ruling
Cooper said ""in some of these other states, some of their deaths can be attributable to the fact that they were having a hard time getting an ICU bed or a ventilator to a patient.""
Cooper was trying to make a point that it’s important to protect hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. That’s a valid concern, given studies show mortality rates can rise when hospitals are overwhelmed. Some news articles have also alluded to these problems.
However, Cooper goes too far in saying some deaths have been attributed to a lack of ICU and ventilator access.
The American Hospital Association, along with experts who have tracked resource availability during the pandemic, say they’re unaware of any specific cases where someone died specifically because they couldn’t access a ventilator or ICU bed. Cooper didn't cite, and PolitiFact couldn't find, enough evidence to support the claim.
Cooper’s statement contains an element of truth, but doesn’t account for critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEoo_H4qTPo&feature=youtu.be,null,,null,

Steve Scalise","Scalise’s claim that unauthorized immigrants are getting priority for vaccination misses the point




If Your Time is short




Scalise claimed during a Fox News interview that Biden was allowing unauthorized immigrants to “jump the line” ahead of American citizens for vaccination.

 
The Biden administration has said everyone should have access to the vaccine regardless of immigration status and get vaccinated when eligible.

 
Current vaccination guidelines recommend certain essential workers and those 65 and older be vaccinated. So, while some unauthorized immigrants may be eligible, it’s because of their job or age, not immigration status.




See the sources for this fact-check




During a Feb. 2 interview on Fox News, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., claimed President Joe Biden was allowing unauthorized immigrants to move ahead of American citizens to get their covid-19 vaccines.
""Now (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine,"" said Scalise, the No. 2 Republican leader in the House.
Lauren Fine, a spokesperson for Scalise, said the representative was referring to a Feb. 1 statement from the Department of Homeland Security. It said the agency ""encourages all individuals, regardless of immigration status, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine once eligible under local distribution guidelines.""
Since supply is limited, wrote Fine in an emailed statement, ""for every vaccine an illegal immigrant gets, that’s one an American citizen waiting in line is not getting. If you’re an American citizen that’s currently in a group that can’t get the vaccine yet, you’re now behind in the line to an illegal immigrant in a group that can get one.""
Considering the DHS statement, other press statements and executive plans, the Biden administration has certainly been vocal about its position that all immigrants should be able to get this shot.
But, we wondered, does allowing this population access to the vaccine mean they are being invited to step in front of American citizens in the queue?
We asked the experts.
The gist of Biden’s policies
The Biden administration released a national COVID-19 strategy plan during the president’s first week in office. The administration, according to the document, is ""committed to ensuring that safe, effective, cost-free vaccines are available to the entire U.S. public — regardless of their immigration status.""
The plan directs federal agencies to take action to ensure everyone living in the U.S. can access the vaccine free of charge and without cost sharing.
During a Jan. 28 press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration feels ""that ensuring that all people in the United States — undocumented immigrants, as well, of course — receive access to a vaccine, because that, one, is morally right, but also ensures that people in the country are also safe.""
The DHS statement also specified that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency wouldn’t conduct enforcement operations at or near vaccination sites or clinics.
The Biden administration didn’t respond to a request to clarify its position on unauthorized immigrants’ access to vaccines in relation to Scalise’s claim. But, based on publicly available information, it is clear the administration wants immigrants to have access to the vaccine. However, no statement or provision in the administration’s policies indicates they should ""jump"" ahead of other Americans.
Public health experts across the board criticized Scalise for his statement, in effect saying he was missing the point.
""The line is not drawn by your immigration or legal status,"" said Dr. Ranit Mishori, senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights, a nonprofit that investigates the health consequences of human rights violations. ""It’s drawn by your vulnerability, your potential for exposure and your risk.""
Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, said Scalise’s claim misrepresents what Biden is trying to do.
""They are simply saying that if an immigrant falls within a category that is currently prioritized (e.g., a health care worker or someone over a certain age), they should not be excluded from getting the vaccine,"" Levi wrote in an email. ""It does not put an immigrant ahead of a prioritized category.""

“The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION recently reversed its stance on children getting the Covid vaccine.”












By Victoria Knight • June 24, 2021







Samantha Artiga, director of racial equity and health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy organization, had a similar take. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of KFF).
""The policies clarify that all people in the U.S. are eligible for vaccinations regardless of their immigration status and encourage immigrants to get vaccinated when they become eligible based on their local guidelines,"" she wrote in an email. ""They do not prioritize immigrants.""
Dr. Jeffrey Singer, a senior fellow in health policy with the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank, said the Biden plan is just following standard public health policy and epidemiological principles.
""Trying to place an emphasis on immigration status might be a good way to press people’s buttons to get a sound bite on television,"" said Singer. ""But immigration status is really irrelevant when we’re prioritizing people. It doesn’t matter where you come from. If you’re here in the U.S., you should get vaccinated.""
Part of the essential workforce
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended in December that states should first prioritize vaccinating health care workers and residents and staff members of long-term care facilities. The next priority group, according to ACIP, should be people ages 75 and older and other front-line essential workers who are not in health care. The Biden administration also recently recommended the age category be lowered to include all seniors, age 65 and older. However, states are free to create their own vaccine distribution plans and decide what groups will get vaccinated first.
Unauthorized immigrants make up significant percentages of the workforces deemed ""essential"" by ACIP. For example, KFF reports that noncitizens (a broad group that could include immigrants in the country lawfully) constitute 22% of all food production workers, 8% of workers in long-term care facilities and 5% of health care workers who have direct patient contact.
The Migration Policy Institute estimated in a February report the number of unauthorized immigrants who qualify as essential workers ranges from 1.1 million to 5.6 million, depending on how essential workers are defined. The institute also reported about 49% of the estimated 2.4 million farmworkers in the United States were unauthorized immigrants as of 2016.
And it’s important those groups get vaccinated regardless of immigration status, not just as a good public health practice, but also from an ethical and humane perspective, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
""It has obviously been a long-standing public health principle that infection anywhere affects the health of everyone,"" said Benjamin. ""It is also of the highest ethical standards to make sure everybody gets vaccinated and gets treated for infectious disease.""
Benjamin added that many unauthorized immigrants who work in essential roles are the foundation keeping society functioning during the pandemic, such as restaurant workers and caretakers.
""They’re at higher risk because they’re out and about and they can’t shelter at home,"" said Benjamin. ""At the end of the day, if we did not vaccinate them and they could not go to work, our economy would totally collapse.""
Plus, 70% to 90% of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity in the U.S.
""As long as this doesn't happen, it doesn’t matter who is vaccinated,"" said Mishori. ""To reach herd immunity in the U.S., everyone regardless of their immigration status, needs to get vaccinated.""
""Viruses don’t know the legal status of their victims,"" Mishori added.
One other note is that the population in question is small compared with the total U.S. population. About 11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the U.S., making up about 3% of the total U.S. population of about 330 million.
Our ruling
Scalise said it is Biden’s policy that ""people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.""
The Biden administration has made it clear that unauthorized immigrants are eligible to receive the vaccine if they are part of a priority group, such as health care workers or seniors. That does mean some unauthorized immigrants who meet specific vaccination criteria for job duties or age could receive a shot before American citizens who do not meet those requirements. This is in keeping with long-standing public health practices.
But Scalise was misrepresenting Biden’s policy when he suggested that unauthorized immigrants are being prioritized over American citizens or can jump the vaccination line. Eligibility for the vaccine is based on job and age categories — period. Under the Biden approach, immigration status is not a qualifying or disqualifying factor.

 Scott Fitzgerald","Fitzgerald overstates claim on pork in COVID-19 relief bill




If Your Time is short





About 9% of the American Rescue Plan funding is slated for direct COVID-19 intervention such as vaccines and testing.


But the vast majority is related to pandemic relief, 85% by the calculations of one nonpartisan group. That includes $1,400 stimulus payments, expanded unemployment, school aid and an array of other specific earmarks.


However, the bill also contains an array of policies without any link to the pandemic, such as a minimum wage increase, pension reform and several local transportation projects.

The American Rescue Plan — the signature initiative thus far in President Joe Biden’s tenure — has passed the U.S. House, sparking renewed debate over what exactly is in the $1.9 trillion package.
Democrats are presenting the mammoth bill as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 500,000 lives and disrupted business, schooling and personal lives on every conceivable level.
Republicans say it’s a pork-stuffed wish list that’s being opportunistically rammed through a Democratic-controlled Congress.
Many Wisconsin Republicans seized on one particular number in attacking the plan:


U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald in a statement: ""More than 91% of the spending in this $1.9 trillion package is not used for pandemic relief.""


U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher on Twitter: ""9% of the $1.9 trillion the ‘American Rescue Plan’ spends goes to actually fighting the Coronavirus.""


U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman on Twitter: ""The public has been told that today’s #BidenBailoutBill is a #COVID19 relief bill. Only 9% goes toward COVID.""


Former Gov. Scott Walker on Facebook: ""Stop the Pelosi Payoff as only 9% of the bill is for COVID health-related relief.""


We’re going to focus on Fitzgerald, who makes the broadest claim in the group. 
 

 
Is it true that the initiative billed as a COVID ""relief"" bill directs hardly any funding in that direction?
The bill
The analysis here examines the House version of the plan, which still must pass the Senate before it could head to Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The Senate could make changes — notably it is expected to drop efforts to increase the minimum wage — which would bounce it back to the House.
Fitzgerald’s office didn’t immediately respond to our request for evidence of his claim, but we have plenty of information from outside sources to examine it.
To be sure, the American Rescue Plan includes many measures unrelated to COVID-19.
PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a claim from conservative Stand for America that the bill contains unrelated projects. Examples cited in that fact check included a $1.5 million bridge connecting New York and Canada, a $100 million underground rail project in Silicon Valley, $480 million for Native American language preservation and maintenance and $50 million in environmental justice grants. The bill would also raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and change pension funding rules.
All told, about 15% of the proposal goes to ""long-standing policy priorities that are not directly related to the current crisis,"" said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, non-profit organization formed to educate the public on federal budget issues. 
On the flip side, the 9% figure is roughly in line with the amount of money going to direct COVID-19 intervention. 
In a fact check confirming about 1% is allotted to vaccinations, PolitiFact National found between $100 billion and $160 billion goes to direct intervention, depending on whether one includes items like $10 billion in medical supplies and $24 billion in child care for essential workers, as the White House does in arriving at the larger figure.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







That’s 4.5% to 8.5% of the total $1.9 trillion total.
But a long list of other initiatives are clearly related to the pandemic, according to a breakdown by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
About 22% of the total bill comes from the $422 billion set aside for $1,400-per-person stimulus checks. Another 13% ($246 billion) is for extending additional unemployment funding of $400 per week.
A combined 12% is going to the following: 


Subsidized COBRA for laid-off workers


Affordable Care Act subsidies for the next two years


Expanded nutrition assistance to replace school lunch programs during the pandemic


Funding for testing and contact tracing


Disaster Relief Fund increases and covering COVID-related funeral expenses


Grants to airlines and contractors to freeze layoffs through September


Defense Production Act funding for medical supplies


Grants for restaurants and bars that have lost revenue in the pandemic


Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance grants of up to $10,000 per business.


It’s hard to describe anything on that list as unrelated to the pandemic and its economic fallout.
Another $519 billion — 27% of the total — is going to state and local governments and schools, much of which will make up losses related to the pandemic and spur school re-opening. Republicans note much of the school funding, however, won’t be spent immediately.
Our ruling
Fitzgerald said, ""More than 91% of the spending in this $1.9 trillion package is not used for pandemic relief.""
Somewhere around 9% of the American Rescue Plan is going to direct disease containment measures such as vaccines, testing and tracing, and other public health initiatives.
There’s room for debate over exactly how much of the $1.9 trillion is related to the pandemic. Surely not all of it. But it’s clear the amount going toward pandemic relief is far above 9%.
One nonpartisan group identified 85% of the spending as being related to the current crisis. A closer look at the individual spending categories confirms, at minimum, that a majority of the spending goes to address the health and economic fallout of the pandemic.
PolitiFact North Carolina rated Half True a claim from U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., that only 9% of the bill was going to COVID, and 91% wasn’t COVID-related. Budd got some credit for referencing 9% in a way consistent with the portion used for direct funding, and there’s a case ""COVID-related"" could reference only direct spending.
But Fitzgerald is farther off in flatly asserting 91% didn’t go toward pandemic relief. That’s a broad claim that badly misstates the figure he’s trying to reference, that 91% didn’t go toward direct COVID-19 intervention.

If Your Time is short





Cannabis extracts could be part of a treatment that helps prevent coronavirus — according to a preliminary study.


The study has not been peer reviewed and it’s based only on lab testing.


The lead researcher said more study, including testing on humans, must be done before any conclusions can be drawn.





See the sources for this fact-check




Weed preventing COVID-19?
That high hope seemed to rise from this headline:
""Cannabis May Stop Coronavirus From Infecting People, Study Finds.""
The headline appeared on an article on MerryJane.com that was widely shared on Facebook. But readers should not get too excited.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The website updated its headline with more accurate information following the publication of this fact-check.
A preliminary study supported researchers’ theory that certain cannabis extracts could be used as part of a treatment to prevent coronavirus infections. But the study has not been peer reviewed and no testing has yet been done on humans.
""Yes, this is an overstatement,"" Igor Kovalchuk, the lead researcher of the study, told PolitiFact about the headline.
Cannabis isn’t exactly marijuana
Cannabis and marijuana are not exactly the same.
Cannabis refers to all products derived from the plant Cannabis sativa. The cannabis plant contains about 540 chemical substances.
Marijuana refers to parts of, or products from, the plant Cannabis sativa that contain substantial amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the substance that’s primarily responsible for the effects of marijuana on a person’s mental state. 
Headline partly contradicted by article 
The website that published the article is part of Los Angeles-based Merry Jane, which describes itself as a ""multi-media and lifestyle company that’s creating the new mainstream culture by connecting cannabis and pop culture.""
The article, however, is more nuanced than its headline. The article says that based on the study, ""cannabis extracts could work as an ‘adjunct therapy’ in new medical products that could reduce the chances of someone getting COVID-19."" 
In other words, despite the headline on the article, the study isn’t saying cannabis alone could prevent infection. 
Study done on artificial tissue, not humans 
The study referred to in the article was done by six researchers from universities of Lethbridge and Calgary, both in Canada. The researchers are also affiliated with two startup companies that do medical cannabis and disease research.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Their study was published April 19 in Preprints, which describes itself as a platform for ""early versions of research outputs"" that are not peer-reviewed. 
So, this is a preliminary research paper.
According to the study, all cannabis plants for the study were grown in a licensed facility at the University of Lethbridge to obtain the extracts, which were then applied to artificial human 3D tissue models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues.
""Application was intended to model medical delivery, such as local mouthwash applications, encapsulated extracts and dosed oils, and inhalers or nebulizers, and therefore these results cannot be extrapolated to the effects of cannabis smoking,"" the study said.
The extracts, ""pending further investigation, may become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy,"" the study concluded. 
These extracts also ""can be used to develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and at-home use. Such products ought to be tested for their potential to decrease viral entry via the oral mucosa. Given the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered.""
In short, the researchers theorize that cannabis extracts could interfere with the virus’ process of infection in cells — but this is based on laboratory testing on specially engineered tissue to fully mimic human organs, not testing on humans.
""Clinical trial (on humans) is a must,"" to determine whether extracts could help prevent COVID-19, Kovalchuk said.
Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, told PolitiFact ""it may be worth more study, but in my opinion this is a very long way from being a legitimate candidate for therapeutics or preventative products like mouthwash.""
Our ruling
The headline of an article shared on Facebook said: ""Cannabis may stop coronavirus from infecting people, study finds.""
The study found, based on lab testing, that cannabis extracts could be part of a treatment that dramatically reduces the chances of being infected by COVID-10. 
But the study is preliminary, has not been peer reviewed and tests on humans would need to be done to determine if the extracts could be part of a treatment that blocks the coronavirus, the study’s lead author said. 
The headline contains only an element of truth. Our ruling is Mostly False.
Clarification, May 28, 2020: The study found cannabis extracts should be investigated as an adjuct treatment for COVID-19 in addition to its use in possible preventative products like mouthwash. This story has been updated to better reflect that distinction.

Andrew Cuomo","Cuomo's claim on nursing home deaths not whole story




If Your Time is short




Cuomo's claim arose from a New York Times analysis of nursing home COVID-19 deaths as a percentage of total COVID-19 deaths in each state and the District of Columbia. 
On the most recent list, New York is 43rd, while five states do not provide enough data to be included. 
The Times warns readers to ""exercise caution"" when comparing states in this analysis because of the different ways that the federal government, states, counties and facilities report data. 
New York has come under scrutiny because health officials will not release comprehensive data regarding deaths of nursing home residents in other settings, such as hospitals. 




See the sources for this fact-check




Gov. Andrew Cuomo continues to be under fire for his administration’s handling of the novel coronavirus in nursing homes, where residents are vulnerable to serious illness or death from the virus. 
In a call with reporters, Cuomo was asked again, this time by the Finger Lakes Daily News, about how his administration dealt with nursing homes, specifically a controversial March 25 order, rescinded in May, regarding patients leaving hospitals and going to nursing homes. Nursing homes felt pressure to accept coronavirus patients from hospitals following the March 25 order. Cuomo pushed back on what he considered the premise of the question.  
""You look at the nursing home deaths in this state,"" Cuomo said. ""Do you know what number we are by percentage before you made that statement? We're No. 46 out of 50 states, and we had the worst problem, and we're 46th in terms of percentage of deaths in nursing homes."" 
The way that New York has counted COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes has come under scrutiny, and we wondered whether Cuomo is correct. 
Flawed comparison
We reached out to Cuomo’s press office, and spokesperson Jason Conwall directed us to a New York Times data analysis of deaths in long-term care facilities by state. 
In the most recent data, published Sept. 16, nursing homes accounted for larger shares of COVID-19 deaths in 41 other states and the District of Columbia - not 45, though Conwall said Cuomo was referencing previous iterations of the Times' data.  The Internet Archive showed a previous version of the list making New York 45th. 
We reached out to KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan source of health information, to ask about Cuomo’s claim. Priya Chidambaram, a policy analyst for the foundation, tracks data about COVID-19 deaths and long-term care. She told us that one of the key differences between New York and other states is that New York excludes deaths that were not in a nursing home. Nursing home residents who develop serious illness and need to be treated in a hospital, and do not recover, are not counted as part of the state’s nursing home deaths, she said. State data is not comparable because of the different ways states report these deaths. Some states include various long-term care facilities in their data, while others just include nursing homes. Other states report residents and staff, some just report residents.

“Cuomo opens New York 72 hours before his daughter's wedding.”












By Madison Czopek • June 17, 2021







The best comparable data for analyzing nursing home deaths comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Chidambaram said. In its data, which uses a different metric, New York ranks in the middle - not among the lowest - for the share of nursing home deaths among its population of nursing home residents. CMS ranks states by deaths per 1,000 nursing home residents. New York had 50.5 deaths per 1,000 residents, ranking 20th on a list of 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of the week ending Sept. 27. The federal government began requiring this data in May, long after the pandemic began in New York.
New York's health commissioner, Howard Zucker, has defended the administration's approach, and said the state does not want to double count deaths - attributing a single death to a nursing home and a hospital, and that he wants to only release data that is completely accurate. A spokesperson for the department has said that the state has been a leader in releasing facility-level data on deaths. 
Our ruling
Cuomo said 45 other states had higher portions of nursing home residents as a share of the total coronavirus deaths in a state. He was referencing an analysis from the New York Times, which puts New York near the bottom, 43rd in a list of 46 states and the District of Columbia, with five states left off the list because of insufficient data. 
But the Times cautions readers about making comparisons among states because of the different ways each level of government and each facility reports the data.
Cuomo's claim contains an element of truth: There is a New York Times database and it includes death numbers for nursing home patients across the nation. But the governor left out some critical facts that would give a different impression about how New York compares with other states for how nursing home residents are faring. New York counts deaths that occur in a nursing home, leaving out those deaths of residents in hospitals. And there's inconsistencies in the reported data that ends up in the database among states and facilities. 
According to federal data, which calculates deaths per 1,000 nursing home residents, regardless of where they die, New York lands near the middle.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







But it’s a limited measure, bearing on a state that became a hotspot well after New York and New Jersey.
The situation
Here’s what news reports said about Florida’s record-breaking coronavirus surge in the days before the post:


Florida had the highest single-day total of new cases by any state, with more than 15,000 new infections.


There were 872 deaths in one week, the highest weekly total in the Sunshine State during the outbreak.


Florida was among the 21 states with outbreaks serious enough to place them in the ""red zone,"" according to a federal report.


For a larger perspective, among the 20 countries currently most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people, behind the United Kingdom, Peru and Chile, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Adding context
Timing is a big reason why the statistic cited in the Facebook post is misleading.
New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, and Florida was hit later.
""One has to wait until all is over to really see how ‘well’ states have been doing,"" Dr. Werner Bischoff, professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest University, told PolitiFact.
As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared with 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York, according to the New York Times.
Death counts and rates are lagging indicators, which means they can confirm a trend after the fact, but can’t necessarily predict the course of the outbreak. 
""While cases started to increase exponentially in Florida in June, deaths only started to increase exponentially in July,"" Boston University global health professor Brooke Nichols told PolitiFact. ""The only way to compare these types of death rates meaningfully would be once we are several months after Florida’s first wave — and compare that to several months after the first wave in New York and New Jersey,"" she said.
Nichols gave an example. On April 4, when the first wave of cases in New York peaked, the state had 237 deaths per 1 million population. Using July 16 as a peak in cases for Florida, the death rate was 223 deaths per million. 
""Those two numbers are eerily similar, and a foreshadow of what’s to come in Florida,"" Nichols said.

Martha McSally","Fact-checking Arizona Senate race claim about Mark Kelly, PPP loan




If Your Time is short





Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses affected by the pandemic.


Kelly criticized how the program has been administered, not the existence of the program.


A company Kelly co-founded and in which he has investments received up to $2 million in loans from the program. Kelly’s campaign and the company say he was not involved in the application process.





See the sources for this fact-check




In the competitive Arizona Senate race, Republican Sen. Martha McSally is taking aim at Democratic opponent Mark Kelly, claiming that he’s a hypocrite who attacked a loan program to help businesses during the pandemic and then took money from the program for his own company.
""Small businesses were hit hard by the pandemic, which is why I fought"" for the Paycheck Protection Program, McSally tweeted July 31. ""Mark Kelly criticized the program, then turned around and took money for his own multi-million dollar company.""
Is McSally right about Kelly? Not really.
An Arizona company that Kelly co-founded and in which he has investments did receive a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program. But Kelly’s campaign said he left the company more than a year ago and had no role in the company’s application for the coronavirus pandemic relief.
Moreover, Kelly’s criticism of the program centered on Congress and the red tape that he said was preventing deserving small businesses in Arizona from getting aid. His public statements show that he wasn’t against the program itself.
McSally, a former U.S. House member and retired Air Force pilot, is vying to hold on to a Senate seat she was appointed to after the resignation of Sen. John Kyl. Kelly is a retired U.S. Navy pilot and astronaut. Both easily won primary elections on Aug. 4.
Background on Paycheck Protection Program
Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses affected by the pandemic. The program was established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, signed into law in March by President Donald Trump.
The law allows businesses to get loans to pay their employees and to cover certain other expenses, such as rent and utilities. The loans are forgiven if businesses meet specified terms.
While the federal government created and administers the program, banks, credit unions and other lending institutions handle the loan applications and disbursement of funds.
‘Mark Kelly criticized the program’
McSally’s campaign said Kelly criticized the program in an April 10 statement and a June 9 tweet. In his messages, Kelly directed his criticism at Congress — saying it should hold banks accountable for ensuring that small businesses can get aid. His criticism centered on how the program was being administered.
""I’ve heard over and over from small businesses across Arizona that the clock is ticking for them, and now it’s clear many of them are running into a wall of red tape blocking them from the aid they desperately need,"" Kelly’s statement said. ""Congress created this program and put much of the application process in the hands of big banks, and they have to provide accountability and make sure this money is getting to those small business owners and their employees who need it.""
In an April 16 statement, not flagged by McSally’s campaign, Kelly said the program was running out of money, that only 10% of Arizona small businesses were approved for relief and that the Senate was adjourning without addressing the issue.

In a follow-up tweet, McSally said she was troubled by reports of publicly traded companies with ""capital & bank relationships"" getting funds, ""while many ma & pa shops can't even get a call back or $1."" The next round of funds had to focus on small businesses, with better oversight and transparency, she said.
‘Then turned around and took money for his own multi-million dollar company.’
McSally’s attack on Kelly refers to a loan received by a company Kelly co-founded.
World View Enterprises, of Tucson, says it provides aerial data and analytics from sensors deployed to the stratosphere. Kelly’s stake in the company is valued at between $115,000 and $300,000, Kelly’s campaign told PolitiFact. But he left his role as strategic adviser in February 2019 and has never been a member of the company’s board of directors, said Jacob Peters, a spokesperson for Kelly.
World View also told PolitiFact in a statement that Kelly was an investor but had no day-to-day involvement with the company.
In late April, World View was approved for a loan to retain 38 employees. The loan was for an amount between $1 million and $2 million, according to Small Business Administration data.
Kelly was not informed about World View’s loan application, ""nor was he involved in the decision process to decide to pursue a PPP loan,"" the company said.
McSally’s campaign did not provide information to dispute the Kelly campaign’s explanation. PolitiFact did not find information showing Kelly was involved in the application process.
Our ruling
McSally said Kelly, ""criticized the (Paycheck Protection Program), then turned around and took money for his own multi-million dollar company.""
Kelly has criticized the way the program has been administered, but not the existence of the program itself. He’s argued that red tape is preventing small businesses from getting funds and that Congress needs to do more to help businesses get the funds and to hold banks accountable.
A company that Kelly co-founded and in which he has investments received up to $2 million in a loan from the program. But Kelly’s campaign and the company say he was not involved in the application process. McSally’s campaign did not provide information disputing that statement and we didn’t find any either.

Karen Brinson Bell","NC elections board leader downplays rule changes




If Your Time is short




Entering fall 2020, North Carolina legislators established specific state laws for mail-in absentee ballots.
By agreeing to a legal settlement, the North Carolina State Board of Elections changed a couple of those rules.
Even though the changes were only for the 2020 election, they effectively replaced laws set in general statutes.




See the sources for this fact-check




In the 2020 general election, North Carolina voters were given more time to return absentee ballots than previously allowed under state law.
The changes were controversial among some legislators, who inquired about them in a legislative committee meeting on Feb. 25. Karen Brinson Bell, the state election board’s director, attended the meeting to speak about future elections. 
""How many of these lawsuits that you’re settling change state law?"" a legislator asked in a video of the exchange. 
Bell responded: ""I think we may have a disagreement as to whether state law was actually changed by the settlement or not. 
""If I take the perspective, and the board takes the perspective that they did not change state law, which is where we are, then we just abided by the settlement rules,"" she concluded.
Conservatives in government and media quickly challenged Bell’s description of the events, raising a two-part question: 
Did North Carolina’s election laws change for the 2020 election? And if so, was it the state elections board that changed them?
To be clear, PolitiFact is not weighing in on whether the changes were good or bad, or whether they were constitutional or not — a source of legislative debate. 
We’re here to review whether there were effective changes in the law. 
Someone who heard Bell’s comments may think the elections board followed absentee ballot rules set by state lawmakers. That’s not the case. In a legal settlement, the state elections board enacted changes to absentee ballot rules that had been set in general statutes.
Changes made
Democracy North Carolina and the North Carolina Alliance for Retired Americans, left-leaning voting rights advocacy groups, sued the state elections board seeking voting rule changes that would help reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. While the lawsuits raised several issues, the most controversial to come out of the settlement were:


How long after Election Day would the board accept mail-in absentee ballots?


Would absentee voters need someone to sign their ballot as a witness?


Entering 2020, state law required mail-in absentee ballots to be signed by two witnesses and arrive no later than three days after Election Day to be counted. The GOP-led legislature later passed (and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed) a law allowing mail-in ballots to be signed by a single witness during the 2020 election.
After the lawsuit was settled, however, voters would have different rules for the 2020 election.


Absentee ballots would be accepted up to nine days after Election Day, rather than three.


Absentee ballots would still require a witness signature. However, voters who mailed an absentee ballot without the signature could rectify the situation by mailing an affidavit, signed only by themselves, to support the ballot’s veracity.


Out of the 5.5 million ballots counted in last year’s election, the board says roughly 2,000 civilian absentee ballots arrived in those extra days between Nov. 7 and Nov. 12. (State law already allowed military and overseas ballots to be accepted if received nine days after the election.)

""Absent from the news — Dominion lost their lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell.""












By Tom Kertscher • June 1, 2021







The elections board, in a statement through spokesman Pat Gannon, argued that the distinction between laws and rules is key. While absentee ballot rules are outlined in state law, the board says state law also grants Bell and the board emergency powers. 
The board compared the change in rules to an extension in voting hours at a polling site, a common occurrence when disruptions delay voting operations.
""That’s not a change to the law. It’s following the law to temporarily change a process to ensure that people can vote, despite the obstacles,"" the board said through Gannon. 
J. Michael Bitzer, chair of the politics department at Catawba College, said he found the comparison to be ""a bit of a stretch."" State law specifically says the board is allowed to extend voting hours if polling operations are interrupted.
When considering changes for the 2020 election, the Republican legislative majority made it clear the witness requirement was important. Legislators also specifically rejected a proposal to further lengthen the absentee ballot arrival deadline during negotiations on the bill.
So, while the legal settlement didn’t amend North Carolina’s laws for the long term, the voting rules effectively deviated from specific laws.
""Whether the BOE was authorized to make the changes, whether the changes were made for good reason, and whether the changes were temporary or permanent does not negate the fact that changes were made,"" Greg Wallace, a constitutional law professor at Campbell University’s Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law, told PolitiFact. ""An authorized, reasonable, and temporary change is still a change.""
How it happened
Now we’ll address the other question at-hand: What role did the state elections board play in those rules changing?
After months of litigation, the elections board announced on Sept. 22 that it had agreed to a settlement with the plaintiffs to move forward with the aforementioned absentee rule changes and asked the courts to approve the agreement in a joint motion. While awaiting the court’s blessing, the state board sent county boards new guidance that reflected the settlement details.
Though Republican legislative leaders are mentioned alongside the elections board as defendants in the lawsuit, they said they weren’t involved in the settlement negotiations and didn’t agree with them. The board had two Republican members who voted for the agreement, then they later resigned saying they didn’t understand the terms of the deal.
Republicans are quick to point out the deal was struck between a majority-Democratic elections board, plaintiffs represented by prominent Democratic elections lawyer Marc Elias, and Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein, whose office defended the settlement terms in court.
It’s fair to say the board is one of four major players, along with the plaintiffs, attorney general and the courts. 
Judicial opinions
The legal battle went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene in the case after a 5-3 vote. Republicans have pointed out that a couple of federal judges admonished the state board for its settlement.
 In an Oct. 14 order, U.S. District Judge William Osteen said he believed the board’s changes could result in unequal treatment of voters. However, he said legal precedent restricts court intervention in cases with fast-approaching elections. North Carolina began issuing absentee ballots to voters on Sept. 4.
Gannon, the board spokesman, pointed out that North Carolina’s appellate courts declined to overrule the conclusions from the state court judge presiding over the case at issue. The state court judge, Gannon added, ruled that the settlement was in compliance with state law.
Still, without the board’s vote, the rules wouldn’t have changed at all. 
""The SBE bears sole responsibility for the settlement on the defendant side because it was the only entity that could give the plaintiffs the relief they sought,"" said Wallace, the law professor.
Our ruling
Bell said the North Carolina elections board ""did not change state law"" as it pertained to the 2020 election.
The board says it was within its legal powers to strike a deal implementing absentee ballot rules that deviated from specific laws set in general statutes. Regardless of who has the power, the election rules were effectively changed, and the board played a major role.

Dan Forest","North Carolina's Dan Forest cherry-picks data on kids, COVID-19




If Your Time is short




Forest cited the Wall Street Journal, which reported: ""Children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia."" 
Forest, who's running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, cherry-picked the stat and then presented it as a medical consensus.
Experts told us it's difficult to say how much more dangerous the flu is than coronavirus, considering it affects populations differently.




See the sources for this fact-check




North Carolina’s lieutenant governor is among the biggest critics of Gov. Roy Cooper’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a Republican who’s running against Cooper, says kids should be allowed to go to school. Currently, students in kindergarten through 12th grade are only allowed to attend in-person classes in some counties — and only at a reduced capacity.
In an interview posted Sept. 2, Forest said Cooper’s restrictions on in-person learning aren’t necessary.
""There’s no evidence anywhere in the world that our kids should not be in schools. There’s no evidence of that anywhere. All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus,"" he said.
Is it true that children are ""17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?""
Forest has repeated similar claims at other events. 
What Forest said
We asked Forest’s campaign where he was getting his information. Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn pointed to a recent editorial from the Wall Street Journal. 
Citing analysis from The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a think tank, the Journal wrote:
""Fatality rate comparisons between Covid-19 and the flu are inapt because they affect populations differently. Children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia, assuming 150,000 coronavirus deaths this year.""
Even if the Wall Street Journal’s description of the study is accurate, Forest isn’t representing it correctly.
First, Forest ignores the paper’s disclaimer that comparisons between COVID-19 and the flu are ""inapt because they affect populations differently."" Then, he misrepresented the math.
The WSJ reported a mathematical range: ""between 6.8 and 17 times."" Forest cherry-picked the top of that range and has stated it as if it is an accepted fact.
Then, Forest misquoted the study. The Journal mentioned deaths, and Forest has repeatedly said ""ill effects."" By doing this, Forest downplays the risk to children.
Coronavirus and kids
The flu appears to be more of a serious threat to children than the novel coronavirus, as PolitiFact reported in August and September. But the CDC hasn’t said how much higher the risk is for the flu.
And the CDC’s website distinguishes between healthy children and those with pre-existing conditions.
For healthy children, the risk of complications ""is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,"" the CDC said. Meanwhile, kids with underlying medical conditions ""are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.""
The term ""ill effects"" is squishy and vague. Let’s look at how many children have been hospitalized by the two illnesses. (PolitiFact Wisconsin reported these figures in its Sept. 8 fact-check of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.)

During the 2018-19 flu season, the hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children. 
For COVID-19 patients in that age group, the CDC says the hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children. (For those interested in the math: 39 is 6.5 times higher than 6.)
While children do appear to be more affected by the flu than by COVID-19, we struggled to find stats that match Forest’s quote.
What experts said
We asked experts: Is there a consensus in the medical community that children are ""17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?""
""I’m not familiar with such a statistic,"" said Bill Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
Neither is Alan Schroeder, critical care physician at Stanford Children’s Health. Schroeder said he hesitates to put a number on the likelihood of children suffering from the flu more than COVID-19.
""The notion that kids aren’t getting really sick is by and large true. But the disparities between influenza and COVID-19 have narrowed considerably,"" he said.
Schroeder noted that, generally speaking, between 100 and 200 children die each year from the flu in the U.S. (And those deaths occurred at times when the nation isn’t limiting travel or practicing social distancing.)
Meanwhile, with the novel coronavirus in the U.S. for less than a year, the number of pediatric deaths is still rising.
As of Sept. 10, the CDC estimated that 62 children, from infants up to age 14, have died from COVID-19. In the CDC’s 15-24 age bracket, coronavirus has killed another 315 people. Researchers think school cancellations this spring prevented up to even more deaths.
The American Academy of Pediatrics estimated that COVID-19 had killed 90 people under age 20 by mid August.
""They’re really oversimplifying the issues at hand,"" Schroeder said of Forest’s quote. In the context of school reopenings, Schroeder said there’s a lot more to consider — children who have underlying conditions, child-to-adult transmissions — than a healthy child’s likelihood of dying when compared with the flu.
 ""And for that reason I don’t find it to be a useful comparison,"" he said.
Our ruling
Forest said, ""All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus.""
He misrepresented a line in the Wall Street Journal, which said ""children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia.""
He cherry-picks the highest number and incorrectly uses ""ill effects"" rather than deaths. 
Are kids ""17 times"" more likely to suffer from the flu than COVID-19? It’s possible, but not conclusive at this point.
Is death an ""ill effect"" of coronavirus? Of course. But Forest's phrasing doesn’t accurately represent the Wall Street Journal’s op-ed.

Janet Bewley","Wisconsin lawmaker overreaches on claim that Republicans delayed COVID testing




If Your Time is short





Republicans took almost no legislative action throughout 2020, going 300 without passing a bill after an initial COVID relief package in April 2020.


But the limitations on testing in Wisconsin have been attributed to lack of available supplies -- not lack of funding.


This phrasing implies Republicans blocked or delayed a specific bill that caused delays, and that’s not what happened.





See the sources for this fact-check




With $3.2 billion from the federal government in play, legislative Republicans took a run at wrestling oversight away from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.
The two Republican-run houses passed a bill that would have given them power over where to spend the money, but this latest of many partisan COVID skirmishes ended when Evers vetoed the bill March 29, 2021, announcing his own spending plan.
The shots fired before that veto included a March 28 TV appearance by Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley, who leveled wide-ranging criticism of Republicans on WKOW-TV’s Capital City Sunday.
""You have to put this in context of how the Republicans typically do things in our state with anything having to do with COVID,"" said Bewley, D-Mason, when asked about the prospect of legislative oversight on the federal funds. ""First they denied that there was really a big issue about it. … And then now that we have resources, they will delay it as much as they possibly can, as they did with testing and everything else.""
Indeed, some Wisconsin Republicans have downplayed the threat of COVID-19, and legislative leaders drew widespread criticism after failing to pass any bill for a period of more than 300 days as the pandemic raged.
But Bewley included a specific criticism that is more original — that Republicans delayed testing, which has been a critical part of limiting the spread of COVID-19.
Did Republicans really slow that process?
Bewley short on specifics
The reference to delayed testing implies Republicans blocked or stalled some specific measure that caused delays.
But Bewley offered no such evidence when asked for backup for her claim. Rather, her staff pointed broadly to the Republican inaction after an initial COVID response bill passed in April 2020.
""By refusing to take any state action, pass any legislation, or allocate any state funds to COVID testing or other pandemic response, the Republicans effectively delayed our ability to make testing more widely available,"" said Leslie Westmont, a spokeswoman for Bewley. ""For example, in November of 2020, Governor Evers proposed a COVID bill that would have allocated $403 million dollars to fund state-wide testing and surge capacity and require insurers to cover COVID-19 testing. The Republicans refused to take up the legislation.""
RELATED: Wisconsin Republicans passed one COVID bill before long period of inaction
She added that with more resources — as Democrats requested —  ""more testing could have been accomplished.""

Emails show that Fauci knew ""hydroxychloroquine worked [and] emailed friends about it being effective.""
 











By Andy Nguyen • June 15, 2021







Indeed, testing capacity was a problem throughout 2020, in Wisconsin and across the world. But officials here haven’t generally cited funding as the issue.
The testing process involves obtaining a collection kit, conducting the test and transporting it to a lab. Supplies needed along the way include at minimum a swab, transport liquid, protective gear, lab machinery and reagent — chemicals used to conduct the test at the lab.
In April 2020, state officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin the supply chain for each of those elements was short of what it needed to be for expanded testing. In August, Advocate Aurora Health stopped testing due to delays receiving testing supplies. Later that month, officials said testing was insufficient to begin reopening schools due to limited state lab capacity.
None of those reports referenced insufficient funding as an obstacle. Bewley also didn’t provide any evidence connecting those dots — a critical point since at PolitiFact the burden of proof is always on the speaker.
Alesha Emmert, spokeswoman for Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, said the bill Republicans passed in April 2020 made allowances for testing.
""The COVID relief bill we approved at the beginning of the pandemic included ensuring no co-pays for COVID-19 testing and setting aside $75 million in state dollars to address future, unexpected needs that federal dollars wouldn’t cover – including things like testing,"" Emmert said in an email. ""Senator Bewley should know that, as she voted for the bill. She’s clearly confusing her talking points in an attempt to make a point that doesn’t exist.""
Our ruling
Criticizing Republicans’ attempt to control disbursement of federal COVID funds, Bewley said Republicans had previously delayed COVID-19 testing.
The phrasing implies a specific action that led to testing being limited, but that not an accurate summary of the situation.
Yes, Republicans took almost no legislative action throughout 2020, and lack of testing was often referenced as a key hurdle in the pandemic. But officials throughout the year said testing shortages were about a lack of available supplies and testing capacity, not a shortage of funding.
It’s not impossible to believe additional funding would have improved testing, but without evidence that’s merely a hypothetical.
That leaves us with a grain of truth, but not much more.

Tom Cotton","Do New York’s homeless veterans qualify for the Excluded Worker Fund?




If Your Time is short



• Cotton’s tweet refers to a budgetary provision in New York state that would provide aid to immigrants who are in the country illegally, but it leaves a misleading impression about its intent.
• The vast majority of homeless veterans are already citizens who qualify for other federal or state assistance programs, and thus are not the population the Excluded Worker Fund was designed to help.



See the sources for this fact-check




In April, New York state’s Democratic-led Legislature passed — and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed — a budget that included $2.1 billion for a new Excluded Worker Fund.
The fund would make one-time payments of as much as $15,600 to immigrants in the country illegally who lost work during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The idea was to provide aid to New Yorkers whose immigration status prevented them from receiving other forms of aid during the pandemic.
Critics of the program expressed outrage that the state was preparing to hand over thousands of dollars to immigrants who were in the United States illegally. 
Some national figures weighed in, such as Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is considered a possible 2024 presidential candidate.
Citing a New York Times article explaining the provision, Cotton wrote in the tweet: ""New York's 1,200+ homeless veterans are ineligible for these $15,600 payments.""
 
Is Cotton correct that New York homeless veterans do not qualify for this aid? We reached out to Cotton's office and were referred to a website that did not address our question.
Our research suggests that Cotton’s argument is both inaccurate — homeless veterans are not expressly barred under the program — and a misleading restatement of the fund’s intent: It’s meant to help the people who wouldn’t be eligible for the kind of aid most veterans already qualify for.
Qualifications for payments
Excluded Worker Fund benefits are available to New York state residents who have been excluded from unemployment insurance, pandemic-related federal support, and other programs because of their immigration status, said Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Budget. 
They must have earned no more than $26,208 in the prior year and suffered a loss of work-related earnings or household income due the coronavirus pandemic, Klopott said. 
The fund doesn’t explicitly bar homeless veterans, as Cotton suggests. If any homeless veterans happen to meet those requirements, they would qualify for these benefits, Klopott said.

“U.S. military arrests Dr. Deborah Birx.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







As a practical matter, this is probably a small group, even if the number of homeless veterans in New York state is higher than the 1,200 cited by Cotton, since few veterans are likely to be excluded from other aid programs because of their immigration status.
While the U.S. military routinely accepts noncitizen immigrants who are in the country legally — often granting them citizenship after several years of service — it generally does not accept immigrants who are in the country illegally. 
An exception is a program called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI. The program, created under President George W. Bush and left largely in limbo during the Obama and Trump administrations, allows immigrants in the country illegally who possess certain in-demand skills such as foreign languages or medical training to join the military.
This program is not only dormant but was capped at a few thousand individuals in its early years, making its members a tiny fraction of the overall veteran population.
What is the program for?
A broader issue is that Cotton’s tweet garbles the purpose of the program.
Any homeless veterans who are already U.S. citizens or legal residents would have been eligible for the original assistance programs that the Excluded Worker Fund is supposed to be backstopping.
In his tweet, Cotton singled out one sympathetic group — homeless veterans — as being uniquely blocked by this program. But by Cotton’s logic, homeless veterans would also be ""ineligible"" for corporate tax breaks and countless other provisions of the budget that were not directed at the homeless or veterans in New York.
And by the same token, farmers, math teachers and poets who are U.S. citizens would be ""ineligible"" for the program, because it’s not meant for them.
""The veteran community has been hit hard during COVID-19 and continues to need help,"" said  James Fitzgerald, deputy director at the NYC Veterans Alliance, told PolitiFact. ""Other communities are in need of help as well, including our immigrant community. Our government should focus on helping as many individuals as possible so we can recover from this terrible pandemic.""
Our ruling
Cotton said, ""New York's 1,200+ homeless veterans are ineligible for these $15,600 payments.""
The post mischaracterizes a program that would provide aid to people who were excluded from other aid programs because of their immigration status.

Facebook posts","Norway deaths after COVID-19 shot were among very frail elderly, not proved to be caused by vaccine




If Your Time is short



• Thirty-three elderly people in Norway died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
• Those who died were very frail nursing home residents with serious underlying illnesses. The inoculation was not determined to be the cause of death. 
• Norwegian health authorities say that in some of the cases, relatively mild side effects from the vaccine such as fever and nausea could have contributed to the deaths of the most frail patients.



See the sources for this fact-check




As countries around the world begin COVID-19 inoculations, vaccine critics are promoting the notion that the shots can easily cause injury or death — even though the evidence does not support their claims.
That’s what happened after Norway reported the deaths of elderly people who had received the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Social media posts, like this one from Fox News commentator Jan Morgan, point to the Norway deaths as evidence that the vaccine causes harm: ""23 die within hours of taking COVID vaccine. ... I’ve never taken a flu shot and I’m certainly NOT letting anyone inject this garbage in to my body.""
Morgan’s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Initial Norwegian reports on Jan. 15 indicated that 23 people had died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. By Jan. 18, the number of deaths had increased to 33, out of about 48,000 vaccinated. Though the Facebook post says people died ""within hours"" of receiving the vaccine, Norwegian authorities said only that 23 deaths occurred within six days of vaccination, and published reports do not indicate the time frame for the remaining 10 deaths. 
The Norwegian government said the country’s vaccination program is initially targeting the most vulnerable — the elderly and those in nursing homes — and ""a high proportion"" of the latter were very frail or terminally ill and already very near the end of their lives.
As a result, health authorities said, ""It is expected that deaths close to the time of vaccination may occur.""
Norway’s ‘reporting culture’
There’s no proof that the COVID-19 vaccines caused the deaths, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said. Norway’s strong ""reporting culture"" for vaccine adverse reactions means that ""health care professionals have a low threshold for reporting possible adverse reactions, even when the causal relationships appear very unclear,"" a government report said. 
An average of 45 people die each day in Norwegian nursing homes and similar institutions, according to the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Therefore, ""it is not a given that this represents any excess mortality or that there is a causal connection,"" Camilla Stoltenberg, head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said at a press conference on Jan. 18.
The COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly but rely on scientific research that is decades old, and they underwent a rigorous review process, PolitiFact has reported. That hasn’t prevented a barrage of misinformation about them, including claims that they can cause death and infertility and that they are part of a plan to implant people with microchips — claims that have all been debunked by PolitiFact.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







U.S. health experts were aware of the possibility that deaths following vaccination would be perceived as being caused by the vaccine. Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a member of the U.S. federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said in December that the likelihood of nursing home patients dying from other causes shortly after vaccination could erode public confidence in the safety of the vaccines. She said that’s why she voted against prioritizing residents of long-term care facilities for vaccines. 
However, residents and staff of long-term care facilities in the U.S. are among the most vulnerable when it comes to COVID-19. They represent 40% of COVID-19 deaths nationwide, though they make up less than 1% of the U.S. population. Other members of the advisory committee voted to include nursing home residents in the earliest phase.
Side effects may have contributed to deaths
Of the 33 Norwegians who died after receiving the vaccine, 13 of their cases have been completely assessed by health authorities. The 13 people were all older than 80, with some older than 90, and were considered severely frail, which was defined as having serious heart failure, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and similar conditions. 
As of Jan. 18, Norway had vaccinated more than 48,000 people, the majority of whom were nursing home residents. The 33 fatalities represent fewer than 1 out of 1,000 of those who were vaccinated, Steinar Madsen, the medical director of Norwegian Medicines Agency, told Bloomberg. 
For some of the frailest patients, though, ""the possibility that relatively mild side effects of the vaccine could have serious consequences cannot be ruled out,"" health officials said. Common vaccine reactions — including fever, nausea and diarrhea — could have contributed to some of the deaths in the 13 cases for which investigations have been completed. 
""There is a possibility that these common adverse reactions, that are not dangerous in fitter, younger patients and are not unusual with vaccines, may aggravate underlying disease in the elderly,"" Madsen told the medical journal BMJ. ""We are not alarmed or worried about this, because these are very rare occurrences and they occurred in very frail patients with very serious disease.""
The risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for much older people are not as well understood, because a limited number of people 85 and older participated in the large clinical trials. Madsen said Norwegian officials are now recommending careful medical evaluation of the very frail before deciding whether vaccination is appropriate.
Our ruling
A Facebook post says, ""23 people die within hours of taking the COVID vaccine. ... I’ve never taken a flu shot and I’m certainly NOT letting anyone inject this garbage in to my body."" The claim implies the deaths were caused by the vaccine.
Norway health officials said 33 elderly people died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. (The initial figure of 23 was later updated.) But the vaccine has not been proved to be the cause of death, and those who died were very frail nursing home residents with serious underlying illnesses. The Facebook post says people died ""within hours"" of getting the vaccine, but authorities said only that 23 deaths occurred within six days of vaccination, and published reports do not indicate when the other 10 deaths occurred.
An average of 45 people die each day in Norwegian nursing homes and similar institutions, so it is not clear that the deaths represent any excess mortality or a connection to the vaccine.

A Facebook post claims that despite being married to immigrants, President Donald Trump and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Americans married to immigrants from receiving stimulus checks.
""Trump and McConnell are blocking stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants. While they are both married to immigrants,"" said the April 23 Facebook post.
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
First lady Melania Trump was born in Slovenia. Elaine Chao, who serves as U.S. Secretary of Transportation and is married to McConnell, was born in Taiwan. So the part of the claim about Trump and McConnell being married to immigrants is correct. 
What about the claim that they are ""blocking"" stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants? The $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law by Trump on March 27. But it did not become law against Democratic wishes. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and only three House Democrats opposed it.
Under the CARES Act, eligible people who filed tax returns for 2018 or 2019 and earned up to $75,000 are set to receive $1,200; married couples who jointly earned up to $150,000 are expected to get $2,400. Eligible tax filers with dependent children under 17 years old are expected to get $500 per qualifying child.
Individuals and couples who earned more than the $75,000 and $150,000 thresholds — but not more than $99,000 or $198,000 — will get some aid, but not as much as those who earned less.
What about Americans married to immigrants?
The Facebook post gives the misleading impression that all Americans married to immigrants won’t get a check. That’s not the case.

U.S. citizens are ineligible for a stimulus check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. There is an exception to that rule: If either spouse is a member of the U.S. military at any time during the taxable year, then only one spouse needs to have a valid Social Security number.
Americans and immigrant spouses who filed a tax return both using a Social Security number are eligible for the stimulus check (if they meet the income criteria).
Being married to someone who has an ITIN instead of a Social Security number is not a disqualifying element by itself, either. If the couple filed their taxes separately, then whoever filed using a Social Security number is eligible for the check.
ITINs are issued by the IRS for tax purposes, so that foreign nationals and other individuals who don’t have a Social Security number can use it to pay income taxes. Some immigrants in the country illegally pay taxes using an ITIN.
About 1.8 million spouses who are either U.S. citizens or green-card holders will be excluded from the stimulus payments, according to estimates from the Migration Policy Institute.

Kamala Harris","Harris highlights racial disparity in distribution of PPP loans but misstates Michigan stats




If Your Time is short





At least 29 Black-owned restaurants in Michigan have received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program. 


The vast majority of recipients did not volunteer racial information on their applications.


Black-owned businesses have been hit hard by the coronavirus-induced economic recession, and research shows racial disparities in access to PPP loans.





See the sources for this fact-check




While campaigning in Flint, Mich., and Detroit, Sen. Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of ensuring a high turnout among Black voters to help elect Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
During a Sept. 22 interview with the TV station WDIV, Harris, Biden's running mate, discussed the racial disparities revealed by the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic recession, which has hit Black-owned businesses particularly hard.
""I looked at the numbers in terms of the restaurants that received the benefit of the PPP in Michigan, and only one Black restaurant received it of the hundreds of others that received it,"" Harris claimed.
""You cannot deny fact, and where there are disparities, they need to be addressed,"" she said.
Researchers say Black-owned businesses have been hit hard during the current recession and have confronted barriers to accessing aid under the Paycheck Protection Program, a federal coronavirus relief program that offers low-interest loans to businesses to help cover payroll and expenses like rent or mortgage payments.
But Harris’ claim on the numbers is incorrect. It’s based on outdated and incomplete data. More current data shows at least 29 Black-owned restaurants in Michigan have received PPP loans.
What PPP loan data show
The campaign shared a Jul. 16 article published by the Detroit Free Press to back Sen. Harris’ claim. It reported that of the 785 Michigan restaurants that had received a PPP loan greater than $150,000, only one was listed as Black-owned. That was according to an analysis of PPP loan data from the Small Business Administration. 
The article did not include the number of Black-owned restaurants in Michigan that received a loan under $150,000, and it noted that many PPP recipients did not report racial demographic information.
The latest data show that the number of Black-owned restaurants receiving PPP loans of any size has increased since this analysis was conducted, though it still lags behind the number for white-owned restaurants.
Updated data show that of the 6,778 Michigan restaurants that received a PPP loan as of Aug. 8, only 1,265, or about 19% reported racial demographic information. Of those, there were three Black-owned restaurants that received loans greater than $150,000, compared with 223 white-owned restaurants; and 26 Black-owned restaurants got loans under $150,000, compared with 804 white-owned restaurants.
So among Michigan restaurants that received a PPP loan and reported racial information, about 2% were Black-owned and about 81% were white-owned.
The vast majority of recipients did not report racial demographic information. That alone makes it impossible to say definitively, as Harris did, how many Black-owned restaurants have benefited from the program.

Black-owned businesses hit hard
Black-owned businesses have been hit hard by the coronavirus-induced economic recession, and they have faced barriers in accessing PPP loans. Among all types of businesses, those with Black owners have been twice as likely to close during the pandemic, according to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
""These firms had weaker financial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and preexisting funding gaps prior to the pandemic,"" said Claire Kramer Mills, assistant vice president at the New York Fed. ""COVID-19 has exacerbated these issues, and businesses in the hardest-hit communities have witnessed huge disparities in access to federal relief funds and a higher rate of business closures.""
While the study found businesses located in counties most impacted by Black business closures received PPP loans at a similar rate as businesses nationally, there was significant variation among the counties. In Wayne County, Mich., for instance, only 11.6% of firms received PPP loans, compared with 17.7% of businesses nationally.
Researchers have identified other racial disparities in access to PPP loans.
Research from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an association of community-based organizations championing fairness in banking, found evidence of lending discrimination based on the race of the applicant for a PPP loan.
Small businesses in majority-white neighborhoods received PPP loans more quickly than in majority-Black neighborhoods, according to a report from the nonpartisan think tank Brookings that looks at the most recent loan data.
Black-owned firms tend to lack strong relationships with banks, especially traditional banks that were initially relied upon to deliver PPP loans, and entered the current recession in a weaker financial position, which helps explain the high rate of closures among Black-owned businesses and barriers to support.
""Senator Harris is making the important point that during COVID-19, Black communities and small businesses have been disproportionately impacted,"" Ben Halle, Michigan communications director for the Biden-Harris campaign, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan. 
Our ruling
Harris claimed that only one Black-owned restaurant in Michigan received a PPP loan.
Her claim was based on old data and referred only to restaurant owners who reported racial demographic information and received loans greater than $150,000.
According to the most recent SBA data, at least 29 self-identified Black-owned restaurants in Michigan have received a PPP loan, far fewer than the number of white-owned restaurants. And there’s other evidence of racial disparities in access to PPP loans nationwide. But the vast majority of loan applicants in Michigan did not provide racial data, making it impossible to determine how many Black-owned restaurants in the state benefited from the program.
Harris’ claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

This item was updated to include a comment from Tiffany's staff. The information did not change the rating.
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, a Republican who won an open seat in Congress in a May 11, 2020 special election, is off to Washington -- but still has his sights set on state government and how it is handling the coronavirus crisis.
Tiffany, who spent nearly seven years as a state Senator before winning the seat, tweeted this on May 26, 2020:
""First the health secretary says don't go to hospitals or clinics, now the tourism secretary says don't recreate. What next, the education governor saying no school this fall?""
The tweet linked to an online article from a Madison-based TV station. It came on the day Democrat Gov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order originally was going to expire. (The order was lifted May 13, 2020 under a state Supreme Court ruling.)
We can’t look into the future, of course, so we’ll have to set aside the bit about what school may look like this fall. But we can look back and see what Department of Health Services secretary Andrea Palm and the Department of Tourism secretary Sara Meaney said in regard to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Did Palm say ""don’t go to hospitals or clinics?"" And did Meaney say ""don’t recreate""?
No.
And: Not exactly.
Department of Tourism 
When we asked Tiffany for backup for the claim, his staff pointed to a May 24, 2020 story from WMTV, a Madison-based NBC news affiliate, as it related to tourism and Meaney. This is the article that was linked in his tweet.
With a headline of ""Wisconsin tourism officials encourage people to not travel to seasonal homes,"" the article noted Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial start of summer and went on to say: 
Travel Wisconsin urged people to stay at their permanent residences when the 'safer at home' order was first announced in March and a month later the department's stance hasn't changed.
""Straight up answer, as the Wisconsin Department of Tourism we are not advising that people travel outside their home communities to recreate,"" Sara Meaney, Secretary of Wisconsin Department of Tourism, said.
The rationale: As people travel to cabins and summer homes, it could help spread the coronavirus and potentially overwhelm small healthcare systems in northern communities.
In the article, Meaney acknowledged the state can’t stop people from traveling, and suggested those who do travel within the state take personal precautions, such as using face masks, and call ahead to see if any restrictions are in place where they are going.

When asked about the statement, Department of Tourism spokesman Craig Trost pointed us to an online toolkit focused on ways to stay safe while enjoying the outdoors. 
The toolkit, created with help from the Department of Health Services, includes guides to safely enjoying parks and trails, going boating, fishing, cycling, camping and walking, using ATVs and UTVs, as well as a guide to going to the beach.
The toolkit includes this line: ""We encourage all land managers, communities, and businesses that support outdoor recreation to use these tools to help create a consistent statewide message inviting Wisconsinites to get outside, stay safe, and be well.""
So, while Meaney discouraged state residents from traveling Up North, the department does not say to avoid any kind of recreation. What’s more, state parks are still open for hiking, along with many boat launches, trails and other recreational sites. 
Department of Health
When it comes to hospitals and clinics, a Tiffany staffer said the congressman was ""referring to the cancellation of elective surgeries, DHS encouraging patients to use virtual doctor visits instead of in-person, and DHS recommending that dentists postpone all elective treatments.""
But those examples have problems as well.
The April 2, 2020 news release from the Department of Health Services, cited by Tiffany, called on residents to use telehealth options during the COVD-19 public health emergency. 
Department spokeswoman Jennifer Miller said the agency has never advised against going to see a doctor, but has supported using telehealth -- that is, video visits and the like -- in some cases to get care. 
""We want people to stay connected to their medical providers now more than ever, and to call their doctor especially if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19,"" she said in an email. 
Indeed, health facilities -- including dentist offices -- were declared essential during Evers’ stay-at-home order. That said, some hospitals limited elective surgeries and some doctors cut back on in-person visits due to concerns over the transmission of the coronavirus. Likewise, any dentist offices delayed routine things, such as teeth cleanings.
Those decisions were made by the health care providers and institutions, though, not mandated by the state. And those institutions have started to take in-person appointments and schedule surgeries again. 
Our ruling
Tiffany claimed top state officials called on residents not to travel and not to see doctors.
While the tourism secretary discouraged folks from traveling to cabins and tourist areas in parts of the state with fewer hospital beds, the department website is focused on safe travel -- not no travel. And when it comes to seeing doctors, the health secretary advocated using virtual visits where possible, but did not suggest residents avoid treatment.

J. Christian Adams","The misleading claim that millions of absentee ballots end up ‘missing or in landfills’




If Your Time is short





A conservative legal group’s report said that during the past four general elections, about 28 million ballots were recorded by the government as “unknown” after they were mailed.


These included ballots that were not returned by the voter, spoiled, returned as undeliverable, or otherwise unable to be tracked. Experts said it’s wrong to categorize these as “missing.”


Some ballots are rejected for missing or mismatched signatures, or for arriving too late, but they represent a small proportion of ballots issued.





See the sources for this fact-check




The coronavirus pandemic has escalated the political battle over efforts to expand voting by mail, with the White House, Congress and local election officials feuding over whether to make it easier to cast ballots from home this year.
A June 3 House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on protecting the right to vote amid the pandemic illustrated the divide — and turned up some questionable claims.
Voting rights advocates on the left, including former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, argued that Americans need more access to voting by mail. Advocates said there has been scant voter fraud in the past, and polls show most Americans support voting by mail.
Conservative legal activists, including J. Christian Adams, said that voting by mail has been problematic. Adams, who served on President Donald Trump’s defunct voter integrity commission, is president and general counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which has filed lawsuits seeking to get jurisdictions to keep voter rolls up to date or to oppose expansions of voting by mail.
""We found numerous failures in election administration, and we know from federal data that voting by mail is the most vulnerable form of voting, where hundreds of thousands of ballots have been rejected for defects and millions more end up missing or in landfills,"" Adams testified. 
The mailed ballots rejected for defects — sometimes as part of safeguards against voter fraud — represent a small percentage of the votes cast over four general elections. And Adams' statement that millions of ballots end up ""missing or in landfills"" is misleading.
RELATED: How battleground states are preparing for the pandemic election’s massive increase in voting by mail
Why some ballots are not returned
Adams’ foundation released a two-page document  in April that included voting-by-mail statistics during the past four general elections, from 2012 to 2018. Using U.S. Election Assistance Commission survey data, the foundation said that about 146 million ballots were mailed out to voters. 
Of those, 28 million ballots were ""not returned by voter, spoiled, returned as undeliverable, or otherwise unable to be tracked."" The federal commission refers to these ballots as ""unknown,"" not ""missing.""
Those ballots ""represent 28 million opportunities for someone to cheat,"" Adams wrote. 
But experts say that’s a mischaracterization of what’s generally happening with these ballots. It’s more accurate to refer to them as uncast or unreturned. 
""The vast majority are sitting on kitchen counters or put in the trash or recycling because individuals who received them did not end up casting votes,"" said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin political scientist.
There are a few reasons why someone may receive an absentee ballot and then not use it. First, millions of these ballots are in the states of Colorado, Oregon and Washington that mail ballots to every active voter. Just as many voters don’t show up in person to vote, many voters in those states skip voting even when they are sent a ballot at home. For voters in other states, some were on ongoing lists to get absentee ballots for every election cycle, and may not have been engaged in a particular one. Even among voters who requested a ballot for that particular election, there are those who, for whatever reason, ultimately didn’t vote.
""Conflating voters choosing not to cast their ballot with ‘missing’ ballots is a fundamental flaw in the argument"" against voting by mail, wrote Vote at Home CEO Amber McReynolds, formerly Denver’s head of elections.

""Absent from the news — Dominion lost their lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell.""












By Tom Kertscher • June 1, 2021







Adams’ spokesman told us that the comments about landfills refers to a statement by Paul Gronke, a Reed College political science professor and director of the Early Voting Information Center.
""Election officials ‘know’ what happened to those ballots,"" Gronke told ProPublica. ""They were received by eligible citizens and not filled out. Where are they now? Most likely, in landfills."" 
Gronke told us that his words were being misinterpreted to suggest something nefarious. 
""These ballots were not returned,"" he said. ""They are not ‘missing.’ These are ballots that are not voted, and most likely, are simply discarded with the trash or paper recycling. That was the source of my somewhat tongue-in-cheek comment about a landfill.""
We sent Adams a summary of what experts said to dispute the characterization of these ballots as ""missing."" Adams defended his use of the word to describe ballots that are essentially unaccounted for.
""They are missing because nobody knows where they are,"" he said. ""They might be in landfills. They might be in the woods. They might be in a trunk.""
Ballots are rejected due to various errors
Adams’ group said that during the four most recent general elections, about 1.3 million ballots were rejected upon receipt out of about 146 million ballots, which works out to about 1 percent.
Federal data shows that rejected absentee ballots are a small subset. In 2016, about 1% of absentee ballots were rejected, most commonly for missing or mismatched signatures, or for arriving after the deadline. Signature checks are one of the ways election officials try to safeguard against absentee voter fraud, but they can also trip up voters who simply forgot to sign their ballots, or whose signatures have varied over time.
""If you talk to election officials, they’ll tell you that signature problems are almost all due to current signatures not matching what’s on file, not due to people fraudulently voting for others,"" MIT political science professor Charles Stewart said.
Rejected ballots can make a difference in an extremely close election, such as Minnesota’s 2008 U.S. Senate election between then incumbent Republican Norm Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken. The outcome of that election was tied up in eight months of litigation over absentee ballots that had been initially rejected because of errors by would-be voters hoping to participate in the election, said Ed Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University.
""Obviously, that’s an unusual case, but it is one example (among others) that shows that absentee ballots are generally more vulnerable to disputation than in-person ballots,"" he said. 
Our ruling
Adams said in voting by mail ""hundreds of thousands of ballots have been rejected for defects and millions more end up missing or in landfills.""
Adams was referring to the outcome of mailed ballots during the past four general elections. Mail-in ballots rejected for defects represent  a very small share of the ballots issued, about 1 percent.
Adams’ claim that ""millions more end up missing or in a landfill"" is misleading in implying that they were mishandled. He is referring to ballots that were mailed to voters and then ultimately ended up in a category that the federal government calls ""unknown."" Election experts said it’s wrong to call these ballots missing — they represent voters who ultimately didn’t cast a ballot.

Facebook posts","Can’t blame governor for high Pennsylvania gas prices




If Your Time is short





A Facebook post blames Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf for high gasoline prices in Pennsylvania.


High gas taxes are one reason Pennsylvania’s gas prices are higher, but large increases result from a law that was adopted before he took office.





See the sources for this fact-check




Across the country, lower gasoline prices — dipping to below $1 per gallon, in some places — have been one byproduct of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Pennsylvania is the exception, according to a Facebook post that blames Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. It says:
""Pennsylvania gasoline — $2.27/gallon. Ohio gasoline — 99 cents/gallon. Actually, 13 states under a dollar! Thanks Gov. Wolf!""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Even within a state, gas prices vary, of course. Leaving aside the precise cost of a gallon of regular unleaded on a given day, it’s fair to say that Pennsylvania’s gas prices are on the high end nationally. 
But gas taxes are only one reason gas prices vary among the states. And large gas tax hikes in Pennsylvania were done with a law that was enacted before Wolf was elected.
Pennsylvania gas prices higher
On May 2, the day of the Facebook post, the average price of regular gas in Pennsylvania was $2.03 per gallon, the American Automobile Association told PolitiFact. Forty states had averages of $1.99 or less.
That post was removed while we were preparing this fact-check. But the same image was posted by another Facebook user on May 4.)
On May 6, as we prepared this fact-check, the average price per gallon in Pennsylvania was $2.028 — ninth-highest in the country, according to AAA. Oklahoma was lowest, at $1.391.
In a comment to his post, the Facebook user cited an April 20 news article from a San Francisco TV station. That article cited a report three days earlier from GasBuddy.com, an app that tracks gas prices, that said gas prices were under $1 in 13 states:  Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wisconsin.
Pennsylvania gas taxes higher
Pennsylvania’s total gas tax (state plus federal) is 77.1 cents per gallon. That is second only to California’s 79 cents, as of Jan. 1, 2020, according to the American Petroleum Institute. (The federal tax alone is 18.4 cents per gallon.)
Pennsylvania’s gas tax is more than twice as high as the tax in three of the other 13 states cited in the Facebook post (Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma). Here are the total gas taxes in those 13 states, in cents per gallon:

Why Pennsylvania gas costs more
Asked why Pennsylvania’s prices at the pump are higher than in the other 13 states, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told PolitiFact it’s generally because of the state’s higher gas tax. But there are also regional factors, he said.
Distance from supply, supply disruptions, and retail competition and operating costs all play a role, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal office.
Marc Stier, director of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, noted that states such as Arizona, which has one of the lowest gas taxes, and Nevada, which is roughly in the middle, have higher gas prices than Pennsylvania.
As of May 6, according to AAA, the average price per gallon was less than 1 cent higher in Arizona than in Pennsylvania, but more than 30 cents higher in Nevada.
The governor’s role
When we asked Wolf’s office about the Facebook post, we were referred to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. A spokesman responded by citing a 2013 Pennsylvania law that raised money for transportation. 
That law was signed by Wolf’s predecessor, Republican Tom Corbett. It resulted in a series of increases in the state’s portion of the gas — from 32.3 cents per gallon to 58.7 cents. 
Stier said he is not aware of any attempts by Wolf, who took office in 2015, to reduce gas taxes. 
Wolf has defended the 2013 tax law as a mechanism to improve aging roads and bridges. In 2017, he and the Republican-controlled legislature allowed another increase from the 2013 law to take effect.
Our ruling
A Facebook post blamed Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf for gas prices in Pennsylvania being higher than in 13 other states, where prices had dropped recently to lower than $1 per gallon in some places, while prices in Pennsylvania were above $2
A recent survey found gas prices under $1 in 13 states. 
Pennsylvania has the second-highest gas tax in the nation and gas taxes are a major reason why gas is more expensive in Pennsylvania.
But large increases in Pennsylvania’s gas tax took place under a law that was adopted before Wolf was elected. And there are other reasons — distance from supply, supply disruptions, and retail competition and operating costs — that cause gas prices to vary by region.

Instagram posts","Instagram post misleads on vaccine efficacy by conflating two different measures




If Your Time is short





A viral Instagram post claiming the COVID-19 vaccines are far less effective than advertised is conflating different measures of efficacy to leave a misleading impression.


The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective. The Pfizer vaccine’s 95% efficacy, for example, means that the people who received the vaccine in clinical trials had a 95% lower risk of becoming infected than those who received a placebo.


A separate measure of vaccine efficacy was the subject of a Lancet Microbe commentary — not a peer-reviewed study. The commentary did not argue that the vaccines do not work, or that the widely reported efficacy figures were inaccurate. An author of the commentary told PolitiFact that the Instagram post misinterprets it.





See the sources for this fact-check




A widespread Instagram post argues, wrongly, that new information has shown the COVID-19 vaccines to be far less effective than advertised.
The post errs by conflating two different calculations used to gauge the efficacy of vaccines, and it makes false conclusions based on that error. 
""The Lancet peer-reviewed study confirms vaccine efficacy, not as 95% stated by the vaccine companies, but as: AstraZeneca 1.3%; Moderna 1.2%; J&J 1.2%; Pfizer 0.84%,"" says the May 26 Instagram post, which received thousands of likes. ""They deceived everyone by reporting Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) rather than Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).""
""Your Pheyezur schmaccine just went from 95% down to 0.84% effective,"" the Instagram post adds, in a reference to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine’s 95% efficacy in clinical trials.
The post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Misspelling vaccine terms is a common tactic used on social media to evade the tools used by fact-checkers.
The article cited in the post is a Lancet Microbe commentary, not a peer-reviewed study. And one of its authors, along with other experts, said the post’s interpretation is misleading.
""It is extremely disappointing to see how information can be twisted,"" said Piero Olliaro, a professor of poverty related infectious diseases at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health. ""We do not say vaccines do not work.""

A screenshot of a May 26, 2021, Instagram post wrongly claiming the COVID-19 vaccines are less effective than advertised.
The person behind the Instagram post did not respond to requests for comment.
Some definitions
The COVID-19 vaccines available for use in the U.S. are highly effective. Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine, for example, was found in clinical trials to be 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The Instagram post says that based on new information, the vaccine ""went from 95% down to 0.84% effective."" But that’s not the case. The post mixes up two different measures of vaccine efficacy that can be calculated from the clinical trial data.
Both measures are expressed as percentages, but they describe different things. Broadly speaking, one describes the probability of avoiding infection by getting vaccinated. The other represents the proportion of people in a group who avoided infection as a result of getting vaccinated, given their baseline risks. The commentary highlighted this second measure.
When we hear that the Pfizer vaccine has 95% efficacy, that doesn’t mean 5% of recipients will get COVID-19. Instead, it means that the people who received the vaccine in clinical trials had a 95% lower chance of becoming infected than those who received a placebo. 
This vaccine efficacy figure is what epidemiologists refer to as the relative risk reduction. 
This is the measure that’s commonly reported for vaccines, including the yearly flu shot, said Natalie Dean, assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. It’s the ""most immediately meaningful"" indicator of efficacy because it’s easily generalizable.

“Fauci’s emails leaked.”












By Ciara O'Rourke • June 4, 2021







Imagine that ""one version of you is vaccinated and one version of you is unvaccinated,"" Dean said. For a vaccine with 95% efficacy as measured by relative risk reduction, ""the vaccinated version of you has a 95% lower risk, lower chance of getting sick.""
The other measure is known as absolute risk reduction. This measure accounts for people’s baseline risks of getting COVID-19. It changes across different groups and timeframes, depending on how likely a certain population is to get COVID-19 in the first place, without protection from the vaccine. 
Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, defined absolute risk reduction as ""the proportion of people in the population who do not develop disease"" as a result of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Put differently, it’s the number of percentage points a population’s risk goes down by taking the vaccine.
""You can imagine that different people will have different baseline levels of risk, depending on where they live, what their occupation is, all different things,"" Dean said. ""The people who had a larger risk at baseline will have a larger benefit (from the vaccine) in those absolute terms.""
Both efficacy figures can be drawn from the clinical trial data, by comparing the percentage of vaccinated participants who got COVID-19 with the percentage of unvaccinated participants who got COVID-19. The relative risk reduction is calculated using a ratio that divides one percentage by the other, while the absolute risk reduction takes the arithmetic difference between the two. (The mathematical formulas are listed in a table with the Lancet commentary.)
The numbers that appeared in the Instagram post come from the Lancet commentary and were calculated by Olliaro’s team. But they’re ""on a totally different scale"" than the 95% and other vaccine efficacy numbers that were widely reported, Dean said. 
The absolute risk reduction ""looks much smaller than the relative effect,"" said Matthew Fox, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University. ""But remember, over the time the vaccine trials are run, only a percentage of those in the study were exposed to COVID, so most people would not be infected even if not vaccinated. So a 1%-2% absolute reduction is a big reduction, and could result in dramatically fewer infections when we vaccinate the population.""
On its own, the absolute risk reduction can be hard to understand, Olliaro said. But the figure can help with policymaking, because it can be used to estimate how many people need to be vaccinated in a given population in order to prevent one additional case of COVID-19.
Why the Instagram post is misleading
The post’s claim that the COVID-19 vaccine developers ""deceived everyone"" wrongly suggests that a cover-up was in effect to make the shots seem more efficacious than they are. 
""The drug companies are not trying to hide anything,"" Watanabe said. ""If you were a competent scientist you could, like the authors of the Lancet article, calculate the other metrics by hand using the data reported in the original New England Journal of Medicine papers.""
Second, the post falsely claims that the Lancet commentary proved the reported vaccine efficacy figures — such as Pfizer’s 95% — were wrong. Those figures have since been backed by real-world studies, including one that found the Pfizer shot to be 90% effective.
Olliaro, who co-wrote the Lancet commentary, said it’s wrong to interpret the commentary — which has led to some back-and-forth among scholars — as saying the vaccines don’t work.
The commentary argued that vaccine developers should more prominently report absolute risk reductions alongside relative risk reductions in order to facilitate public health decisions and compare vaccines, Olliaro said. 
But the ""bottom line,"" Olliaro said, is that ""these vaccines are good public health interventions.""
Our ruling
An Instagram post says, ""The Lancet peer-reviewed study confirms vaccine efficacy, not as 95% stated by the vaccine companies, but as: AstraZeneca 1.3%; Moderna 1.2%; J&J 1.2%; Pfizer 0.84%."" The post says the vaccine developers ""deceived everyone.""
The Lancet Microbe article cited as evidence was a commentary, not a peer-reviewed study. And the commentary did not say that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t work, or that the widely reported vaccine efficacy numbers — such as Pfizer’s 95% efficacy — were inaccurate.
The post errs by conflating two different efficacy measures to give the false impression that the vaccines are far less effective than advertised, and that the vaccine developers gave inaccurate numbers to the public.

Kristi Noem","S.D. governor gives state high marks in handling the pandemic. Are they deserved?




If Your Time is short




While South Dakota is excelling in vaccine distribution and keeping its economy intact, some health measures show the state is also dealing with one of the highest per capita Covid death rates in the country.
Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, it’s difficult, and too early, to compare how states performed.




See the sources for this fact-check




COVID-19 has pushed states to adopt unique approaches to protect their residents, but few have garnered as much scrutiny as South Dakota. 
Its governor, Kristi Noem, refused to enact a mask mandate or close any businesses. She argued these precautions were a matter of personal choice, even at large gatherings, such as a July 3 political event at Mount Rushmore and the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis that was connected to COVID-19 cases in Minnesota and other nearby states.
She sees success in the approach.
In a recent television interview, Fox News’ personality Laura Ingraham asked Noem, a Republican, why she believes news outlets criticize her handling of the pandemic. Her response: While her state sought to protect high-risk populations and keep hospitals from overflowing with patients, she said, it was done in a way that still allowed residents to earn a living.
""That was a unique approach that, for our people, really worked well,"" she said in the segment. ""We did have tragedies and we did have losses. But we also got through it better than virtually every other state.""
That got us wondering. Is South Dakota really ""through"" the pandemic? And on what measures is this statement based?
We first reached out to Noem’s office to ask these questions.
In an email, communications director Ian Fury didn’t address the first question. On the second, Fury cited South Dakota’s standing in these categories: vaccine distribution, unemployment, the number of people moving to the state and the state’s budget surplus.
Fury dismissed using ""an apples-to-apples"" comparison between South Dakota and other states on measures such as deaths and case counts, saying such assessments are flawed because the timing of surges and the metrics used can vary by state.
Expanding the lens on how South Dakota’s doing
Several metrics can offer clues about how a state is managing the pandemic, experts said.
In the health category, the number of deaths per capita is one way to track the most severe COVID-19 cases, said Kumi Smith, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota. 
This metric is not a real-time snapshot of how quickly the virus is spreading in a community, given the lag in reporting deaths. But Smith said it can provide ""a much fuller picture of what’s going on with the pandemic"" than case counts alone. That’s because case counts can wax and wane depending on other factors, such as the availability of coronavirus tests and which populations a state prioritizes for testing, she said.
In South Dakota, 1,815 lives have been lost to the pandemic, making its per capita death rate, as of Feb. 10,  205 people for every 100,000 residents, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state’s death rate ranks among the 10 worst in the nation.
Another key health metric is positivity rates — or the percentage of people tested who have the virus. It can indicate whether a state is regularly testing enough of its residents, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-diseases physician and senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University.
Positivity rates vary based on how they are calculated. Data from the South Dakota Department of Health and the CDC show the average weekly positivity rate peaked in the spring. Few tests were being done at the time, which means every positive result would have a greater impact on the rate. The Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Tracker, which uses a different method, shows the state’s rate peaked in November.

High positivity rates can indicate a lack of adequate testing that allowed the virus to spread unchecked, said Adalja. ""Their death count may be even higher,"" he added, because some of those cases may not have been properly tested and identified as caused by COVID-19.
Last week, the positivity rate hovered slightly under 7%, as reported by the state. Johns Hopkins researchers placed the figure closer to 20% as of Feb. 3. Both are above the 5% threshold recommended by the World Health Organization to reopen a community safely.
Hospitalization data — specifically, the number of intensive care unit beds occupied — can also help gauge how a state is handling the pandemic, public health experts said. By comparing the number of beds occupied in intensive care units to the year before the pandemic, said Smith, the metric can show whether hospitals could keep up with the demand caused by the virus.
News reports indicate some South Dakota hospitals struggled to keep up with demand in the fall when the state’s outbreak peaked. As of Feb. 10, state data shows about half of adult and pediatric ICU beds in the state were available.
Public health experts noted South Dakota has emerged as a national leader in distributing COVID-19 vaccines to its residents, ranking among the top 10 states with the most residents vaccinated per capita.
And the economy?
Most of the metrics Noem’s office highlighted related to South Dakota’s economy. And, indeed, the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the country and ended the budget year with a $19 million surplus.
How did the state manage to pull that off during a pandemic? Evert Van der Sluis, a professor of economics at South Dakota State University, said several factors helped. The state experienced less of an economic decline than initially projected at the start of the pandemic because of federal aid, conservative revenue projections and a multibillion-dollar investment in wind energy, he said.
South Dakota — where agriculture is the top industry — also benefited from billions of dollars in direct federal government payments to farmers, said Van der Sluis. While some of these payments were connected to the pandemic, others helped offset the financial losses caused by fallout from a U.S. trade dispute with China.
However, Van der Sluis said, these indicators don’t capture the depth of the damage caused by the pandemic. 
They also don’t necessarily show how South Dakota compares with other states, because they don’t take into account that variations in population density, tax revenue and industries all influence how a state manages an outbreak.
""We can talk about economic well-being,"" he said, ""but some of the enormous harm done by COVID-19 is not reflected at least in the short run by economic measures."" It may become apparent in long-term measures like health care spending and lost productivity, he added.
While the lack of lockdowns may have also played a role in keeping South Dakota’s economy afloat, said Lucy Dadayan, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, there are other states that raked in cash while also implementing strict public health measures. Case in point: California.
As reported by Politico, California defied expectations of an economic downturn due to tax revenue from its wealthiest residents and their stock market gains. Ultimately, Dadayan said, a state’s ability to stay financially afloat depends on a variety of factors — which makes it more difficult to draw comparisons between states and their economic performance during the pandemic.
""It all matters,"" she said.
Our ruling
Both public health measures and fiscal stability represent important pieces to forming a full picture of how the state is handling the pandemic, experts said.
As Van der Sluis noted, these metrics are imprecise instruments for measuring the damage from a deadly health crisis.
In addition, comparing states wholesale is difficult given their differences and the dynamic nature of the pandemic, as various sources noted. And, though South Dakota is currently experiencing a decline in case counts, with a total of 109,580 cases to date and growing concern nationwide about the virus’s emerging variants, it’s hard to say the state has ""come through"" the pandemic. 
Noem’s statement on South Dakota’s performance cherry-picked the data, emphasizing the state’s economy while giving less weight to the lives lost and burden of disease its residents suffered.

Coronavirus







Andrew Cuomo","New York’s nursing home policy was not fully in line with CDC




If Your Time is short




The Cuomo administration issued an advisory March 25 that stated that nursing homes ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents” coming from hospitals, regardless of whether they are infected with the new coronavirus. 
The CDC warned nursing homes to keep COVID-19 out of their facilities and said nursing homes can admit coronavirus patients, but only if they are able to properly care for them. 
The Cuomo administration says that regulations that predate the pandemic require nursing homes to admit only those patients for which they can care. However, in the month following the March 25 advisory, nursing home operators felt that they had no choice but to accept these patients. 




See the sources for this fact-check




New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, facing criticism for how the state handled COVID-19 in nursing homes, has said his administration followed guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Approximately 6,000 nursing home residents in New York have died from the virus, and Cuomo was asked on May 20 about calls for a federal probe into how the state handled nursing homes, and in particular, a March advisory that sent COVID-19 patients from hospitals to nursing homes. 
""I’m not going to get into the political back and forth, but anyone who wants to ask, why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance,"" Cuomo said. 
Is Cuomo correct? We looked at federal guidance at the time of the state's March 25 order, as well as other state Health Department actions at that time. 
CDC guidance
 
Before the state Health Department sent its controversial March 25 advisory, which has since been withdrawn, the CDC released guidance for nursing homes.
The CDC cited two ""key factors"" to consider when deciding whether to discharge a patient with COVID-19 to a long-term care facility, said Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokesperson. First, is the patient medically ready for discharge to a long-term care facility? And second, is the selected long-term care facility able to safely care for a patient recovering from the virus by implementing all recommended infection control procedures? These directives were in place on or before March 23, two days before the state issued its advisory. 
One week before the state's advisory was released, the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Report looked at a facility in Washington State. The report’s authors recommended that ""in the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks in much of the United States, it is critical that long-term care facilities implement active measures to prevent introduction of COVID-19."" 
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal regulator of nursing homes known as CMS, also issued COVID-19 guidance. 
The top administrator at CMS, Seema Verma, pushed back on Cuomo’s claim that the state followed federal guidance. She  cited a March 13 CMS document, which says that nursing homes should only accept those patients for which they can care.  
The CMS memo also states: ""Per CDC, prompt detection, triage and isolation of potentially infectious residents are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among residents, healthcare personnel, and visitors at the facility. Therefore, facilities should continue to be vigilant in identifying any possible infected individuals."" 
It was a week after the Cuomo order, on April 2, that the CMS said new long-term care patients and residents ""should be screened for COVID-19 through testing, if available.""  
CMS guidance also states that if possible, nursing homes should dedicate a unit or wing exclusively to residents returning from the hospital, where they can remain for 14 days without symptoms.
State order
 
The state was clear about why it issued its March 25 advisory to nursing home administrators, directors of nursing and hospital discharge planners: There was an ""urgent need"" to free up space in hospitals for seriously ill coronavirus patients. 
The advisory said all nursing homes ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents returning from hospitals to"" nursing homes, and that hospitals must declare residents medically stable before they are sent back to the nursing homes.  
The next directive, where ""NH"" is ""nursing home"" (emphasis by the Department of Health): ""No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.""
It also stated: ""As always, standard precautions must be maintained, and environmental cleaning made a priority, during this public health emergency.""
In other communications in March, the state told nursing homes to isolate infected residents in their rooms or to consider grouping them in a dedicated unit, as well as to stay current with CDC guidelines in preventing the spread of the disease.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







What Cuomo says
To support Cuomo’s claim, the administration pointed us to longstanding state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require nursing homes to only accept patients for which they can care. 
""This is business in a nursing home: Take them if you can care for them,"" said state Department of Health spokesperson Gary Holmes. 
Holmes also pointed us to the March 13 CMS memo, which states that when a resident who was diagnosed with COVID-19 is coming from a hospital, nursing homes ""can accept"" them, as long as the facility can follow CDC infection control measures. 
The CMS memo also states: ""Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.""
Order’s impact 
Nursing homes felt pressure to accept coronavirus patients following the March 25 order.  
The AMDA-Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine issued a statement on March 26 opposing the order: ""We find the New York State Advisory to be over-reaching, not consistent with science, unenforceable, and beyond all, not in the least consistent with patient safety principles."" A joint statement by that organization and others in long-term care three days later reinforced their objections: ""a blanket order for every nursing home in the state to accept all admissions from hospitals is not sound policy.""  
On April 9, the head of a Brooklyn nursing home asked state health officials if COVID-19 patients could be transfered to the Javits Center or the Navy hospital ship, and was denied permission, the Associated Press reported.  
In late April, when reporters questioned Cuomo about the directive that nursing homes accept coronavirus patients, Cuomo repeatedly said that nursing homes should find other beds for these patients if they cannot care for them, or turn to the state to do so. He also said that the facilities ""don’t have the right to object"" to the state’s policy.  
On April 23, State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said no nursing home had asked the state to take any patients it couldn’t handle.
On April 29, after the state's policy had been under intense scrutiny, Zucker wrote a letter to nursing homes, telling them to alert the state if they have patients for which they cannot care. 
In recent weeks, three facilities have asked the state for help, Holmes said. 
The March 25 advisory has been removed from the state website, and the state’s directive to nursing homes is now much different. Cuomo issued an executive order on May 10, which states that hospitals ""shall not discharge a patient to a nursing home, unless the nursing home operator or administrator has first certified that it is able to properly care for such a patient."" The order also requires that a patient must be tested for COVID-19, and the test must be negative. 
Though the state's actions have been criticized, it’s unclear what was the biggest source of infection in nursing homes, whether it was incoming residents, or health care workers and visitors unaware they had the virus. 
Our ruling
The CDC's guidance at the time of the March 25 state order was that COVID-19 patients who are medically stable can be discharged from a hospital to a nursing home, but only if the nursing home can implement all recommended infection control procedures.
CMS, a federal agency that regulates nursing homes, issued similar guidance, and also said that preferably, coronoavirus patients should be cared for in a dedicated unit. 
Like CDC and CMS, the state Health Department said only those patients who are medically stable can be discharged, and also recommended that nursing homes consider dedicated units, if possible. The Health Department prohibited nursing homes from requiring a COVID-19 test before admitting a resident, while CMS said new residents should be tested, but did not require it. 
The Cuomo administration points to state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require facilities to accept only those patients they can care for. In addition, earlier state communications encouraged nursing homes to stay current with CDC guidance.
But once the state issued its March 25 advisory, nursing home operators said that they felt they had no choice but to accept residents who were either known to be infected or suspected to be. That’s because the March 25 memo did not say anything about making sure that a nursing home can care for a patient before making an admission decision, and said they ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents."" In the month following the memo, nursing homes pleaded for relief from the order.

Facebook posts","Video shows outdated face mask guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci




If Your Time is short





An old video of Dr. Anthony Fauci saying that people don’t need to wear face masks was taken out of context.


Since April, the CDC has recommended face coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and Fauci has pushed for their use as well.





See the sources for this fact-check




A video showing Dr. Anthony Fauci telling people not to wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is being taken out of context on social media. It’s an outdated video that ignores the fact that the CDC and Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, both recommend most people wear face masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.
The video post from June 24 was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
It shows footage from CBS’ ""60 Minutes"" on March 8, when Fauci said that, in general, people did not need to wear masks when they went outside. The video is framed by the words, ""Dr. Fauci: No reason to be wearing a mask."" 
The 40-second clip starts off with Fauci saying, ""Right now, people should not be walking, there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask."" He said masks do not provide the ""perfect protection"" against contracting the virus that people think. The clip ends with Fauci saying, ""When you think masks, you should think of healthcare providers needing them.""
The clip ends with Fauci wearing a mask. The Facebook user who posted this video in June said Americans are ""being toyed with.""
It is not apparent to many viewers that Fauci’s statements were cherry-picked, and the video is four months old.
The clip left out, for instance, one reason Fauci gave for some Americans wearing a mask: ""The masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else."" 
A lot changed after that interview. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. spiked in April and reached new all-time highs in late June and early July, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Says Anthony Fauci will make millions off new book.












By Samantha Putterman • June 15, 2021







In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted its recommendations on face coverings for people over 2 years old when leaving their household. While the CDC previously discouraged people who weren’t showing symptoms from wearing face coverings, the agency said the switch came after studies about virus transmission by people who are asymptomatic.
In a June interview with TheStreet, a financial news website, Fauci said that wearing a mask is better than not wearing one because it can prevent a person from infecting someone else through droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking loudly, for example. Fauci also said that masks can protect, ""to a certain degree,"" the person wearing a mask from getting infected.
Fauci said that public health officials previously stated that face coverings weren’t necessary because they were concerned about a shortage for those who need them most, like medical professionals.
""Right now, unequivocally, the recommendation is when you’re out there, particularly if you’re in a situation where there’s active infection, keep the distance physically and wear a mask,"" he said on TheStreet.
Our ruling
A viral Facebook post shows Fauci saying people did not need to be wearing face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is framed by text that says, ""Dr. Fauci: No reason to be wearing a mask.""
The undated clip lacks significant context. The interview happened in March, amid shortfalls of face masks for hospital workers. The CDC and Fauci have since shifted their recommendations on face masks amid rising coronavirus cases, saying that most people should wear face coverings in public spaces to reduce the spread of the virus. 
The all-caps summary text is an oversimplification of what Fauci said. He was speaking generally when he said people did not need to be wearing a mask in public in March. However, Fauci said in the same interview that infected people should wear a mask to prevent other people from catching the virus. The clip leaves that out.

Facebook posts","A claim comparing adverse events for COVID-19, flu vaccines exaggerates raw data




If Your Time is short





Raw data indicate that the rate of reported “adverse events” — ranging from mild side effects to serious health problems or death — following COVID-19 vaccinations is many times higher than for flu shots.


Reports of adverse events to the federal tracking system are not verified, and the CDC and experts say the data cannot be used to draw conclusions about vaccinations causing the adverse events.


Experts say the data about the new COVID-19 vaccinations are too new to make meaningful comparisons with flu shots.





See the sources for this fact-check




An article widely shared on Facebook from the website of Ron Paul, a Texas doctor and former GOP congressman, carried this ominous headline:
""Coronavirus vaccinations seem to be causing 50 times the adverse events of flu vaccinations after just the first of two shots.""
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The article, which appeared Jan. 6 on the website of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, cites a journalist’s reporting of data from a federal reporting system that health officials use to track and study ""adverse events"" associated with vaccines, ranging from mild side effects to serious health problems.
The journalist, Alex Berenson, told PolitiFact he has not reported that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing the adverse events, only that the data are showing many more such events than are reported with flu shots. ""I am pointing to a potential problem that this data raises,"" he said. 
Health experts told us there isn’t enough data in the reporting system to indicate whether a vaccine causes a particular reaction, or to accurately compare the adverse events associated with different vaccines. 
Claim relies on tweets
The article reported on what it called ""disturbing numbers"" from a series of tweets a day earlier from Berenson. 
Berenson wrote that through Dec. 22, with fewer than 1 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine given, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had received reports of 307 emergency room visits and 17 ""life threatening"" events, for ""roughly 50 times the rate of adverse events from the flu vaccine."" 
""It gets worse,"" the article said, noting that Berenson wrote that the COVID-19 adverse events were reported after shots were given mostly to healthy people in settings where problems can be quickly treated and before the rollout to older, less healthy people.
Berenson’s tweets said he obtained his figures from the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
The CDC told us its system does not allow for searches dating back to Dec. 22, so we could not replicate the searches Berenson did, and Berenson told us he didn’t have the earlier search results from the CDC’s database.
But Berenson showed us screenshots of results from a more recent search he did of the database, which he said showed that adjusted for the number of vaccinations given, there were now roughly 35 times as many adverse events reported for COVID-19 vaccinations as for flu shots. The search results he showed us indicated 4,060 adverse events after 4 million COVID-19 vaccinations in the three weeks ended Dec. 31; and 9,553 adverse events reported over 18 months for 180 million flu shots given during the 2019-20 flu season.
Reporting system’s limitations
Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a physician in the infectious-disease division at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned against reading too much into the CDC’s figures cited in the tweets or the article.

""The VAERS system is very noisy, so it's hard to compare,"" he said. The system, he said, identifies ""a lot of temporal associations that are not necessarily causal.""
VAERS is not designed to indicate whether a vaccine caused a health problem, but is good for detecting patterns of events that might indicate a problem, which in turn might trigger further investigation of a possible safety concern. 
The site notes that it contains ""unverified reports"" of adverse events that occur after vaccination. Anyone can make a report.
Results of searches on the VAERS database appear with this caveat, among others: ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.""
As part of heightened safety monitoring for COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration ""have strongly engaged healthcare providers, public health jurisdictions and the public to report adverse events to VAERS,"" said CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund.
Dr. Werner Bischoff, professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, said he had ""several concerns"" with the statement comparing the COVID-19 and flu vaccines.
""Any adverse events, from mild to severe, are much more closely monitored"" for COVID-19, given that people receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are observed for at least 15 minutes, which generally does not occur with flu vaccinations, Bischoff said. 
""The range of side effects is broad, as with any other vaccine, and we need more data to accurately estimate the occurrence of severe reactions caused by the COVID vaccine,"" he added.

Mike Pence","Pence in RNC speech praises Trump’s COVID-19 ‘seamless’ response, leaves out his state feuds




If Your Time is short





Early in the pandemic, Trump feuded with governors over whose responsibility it was to secure supplies.


States found themselves competing with each other and the federal government for scarce personal protective equipment and testing materials.


At one point, Trump threatened to withhold school funds for districts that didn’t reopen.





See the sources for this fact-check




Vice President Mike Pence portrayed his boss President Donald Trump as a leader who reached out across the aisle to help during the pandemic.
""President Trump marshalled the full resources of the federal government and directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America in both parties,"" Pence said during his Aug. 26 Republican National Convention speech.
Clearly the federal government has provided supplies and funding to states led by both parties in response to the pandemic, and Pence himself has held regular conference calls with governors in both parties. But Pence was speaking about the actions of Trump, not his own. 
Pence’s comments ignore Trump’s multiple feuds, many times with Democratic governors, about state-federal responsibilities and pandemic response. 
A Trump campaign spokesperson sent us a list of dozens of tele-conferences and meetings that Trump or Pence had with governors including Democrats such as New York’s Andrew Cuomo, and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. In March, Trump sent a letter to governors thanking them for ""stepping up to help America confront this unprecedented global pandemic."" The campaign pointed to actions by administration officials to brief governors about making available supplies, such as testing swabs, utilizing the National Guard, and reopening their state’s economies. 
Trump argued with governors over COVID-19 supplies, tests
Early in the pandemic, Trump traded barbs with governors, especially over where responsibility lay in securing medical supplies for the states. 
After declaring a national emergency over the health crisis on March 13, Trump directed governors to order their own ventilators, respirators and supplies, saying the federal government is ""not a shipping clerk."" Governors in both parties shot back that Trump’s stance, and the lack of coordination from Washington, left states bidding against one another and the federal government for access to critical equipment.
Cuomo said it was akin to competing on eBay with 50 other states and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Whitmer and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and then chair of the National Governors Association, were among those pleading for better coordination from FEMA to ensure that supplies were distributed based on need. 
""The lack of any centralized coordination is creating a counterproductive competition between states and the federal government to secure limited supplies, driving up prices and exacerbating existing shortages,"" they wrote in a joint March 30 op-ed in the Washington Post.
A couple days earlier, Trump said during a White House briefing that governors should be ""appreciative"" toward him and the federal government.
Speaking of Pence, Trump said: ""He calls all the governors. I tell him — I mean, I’m a different type of person — I say, ‘Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington. You’re wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.’"" On Twitter, Trump said Whitmer was ""way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue.""
In April, Trump said that testing ""is a local thing"" and that states should turn to commercial labs for help. After he was blasted by governors from both parties, Trump said the federal government would step up efforts to get testing supplies.
Governors also called on Trump early on to enact the Defense Production Act, a law that gives the president authority to expedite the supply of materials for national defense, in order to ramp up production of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing supplies. While the president did eventually invoke the act to produce ventilators and medical equipment, he delayed efforts to do so and did it sparingly. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called for him to broaden its use.

In April, Trump said that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, had reopened Georgia ""too soon."" In May, he criticized Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for keeping parts of his state closed that Trump said were ""barely affected."" 
Trump said in mid April that it was up to him — not the governors — about when to re-open states on lockdown.
Some governors bypassed the federal government to work together
Frustrated with the responses from the Trump administration, some governors teamed up with each other to get needed supplies.
In May, a coalition of governors from seven Northeastern states, including New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware, teamed up to buy personal protective equipment and ventilators and to create a re-unified reopening strategy. 
As late as July, some governors were calling on the feds for help and not getting what they needed. There were shortages of testing supplies, as well as personal protective gear. Washington state asked for 4.2 million N-95 respirators. It got a bit under 500,000. It asked for about 300,000 gowns. It got about 160,000.
On Aug. 18, a bipartisan group of governors — five Democrats and five Republicans — announced they would be teaming up with the Rockefeller Foundation to create a national testing strategy in the absence of federal action. The 10 states are Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Utah, Arkansas, Rhode Island and Virginia. Their goal is to buy and deploy 5 million COVID-19 antigen tests. 
Feuds between Trump administration and states continue
The Trump administration sought to pressure states to reopen in-person schools. In July, Trump threatened to cut off funding if schools didn’t reopen.
This summer, the Trump administration reduced the federal share of National Guard assistance to the states to help with pandemic response, despite pleas from governors in both parties. An Aug. 3 memo said that the federal government would no longer continue to pay for 100% of the tab for most states and that it would be reduced to 75% as of Aug. 21.
And when the CDC unveiled new testing guidelines that downplayed the need to test people who don’t show symptoms — about 40% of those infected — Cuomo and California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that they won’t follow it. Asymptomatic people are thought to be significant spreaders of the virus.  Both governors at times praised certain responses by the Trump administration to help their states respond to the pandemic.
Our ruling
Pence said, ""President Trump marshalled the full resources of our federal government from the outset. He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America in both political parties.""
Trump and top administration officials have communicated with governors of both parties for months in meetings, phone calls and written communication. But Pence’s comment ignores that Trump has feuded with governors over state-federal responsibilities, supplies and shutdown or reopen policies. He’s also suggested a lesser role for the federal government, and said that the handling of COVID-19 should be left to the states. 
We rate this claim Mostly False.

A Facebook post criticized Vos’ access to a mask, gloves and gown while working the polls on Election Day, saying others didn’t have the same protective equipment.

At the same time, some poll workers across the state only had access to masks and gloves.

After Republicans fought to keep Wisconsin’s April 7, 2020 election on track as planned amid the coronavirus outbreak, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos worked at a polling place in his district covered head to toe in protective gear.
Vos, R-Rochester, volunteered to work at a Burlington polling site after thousands of poll workers across the state stayed home to avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus. The election occurred despite efforts by Democrats to avoid in-person voting, and as health officials warned against such gatherings in the middle of a pandemic.
""You are incredibly safe to go out,"" Vos told the Racine Journal Times on Election Day.
Vos’ garb drew swift criticism from voters who say the Republican-controlled Legislature forced the state to hold an unsafe election. One Facebook post shared more than 4,000 times articulated that anger.
""The election workers he forced to work today do not have equivalent protection,"" the April 7, 2020 post stated.
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
The City of Burlington provided workers at its one in-person polling site with the same gear that Vos wore. But many poll workers across the state did not have that same level of protection.
Let’s see where the Facebook claim lands.
PPE protocols in Burlington
Quick reminder: The April 7 election took place after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers tried first to move the election to all mail, but the Republican-controlled Legislature rebuked his request and ended a special session without action.
Evers then issued an executive order that would have delayed in-person voting until June. Vos and Republicans took the matter to the state Supreme Court, where the conservative majority reversed the order hours later.
Now, back to the Facebook post.
A video from the Journal Times, along with photos that circulated on social media, show Vos wearing a face mask, gloves and protective gown. When asked about his personal protective equipment (PPE), a staffer for Vos referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a tweet by the Assembly speaker.
""A requirement for working at the polls was to wear PPE to protect the public and the workers,"" Vos tweeted. ""EVERY single person working at the polling place wore the same gear, not just me.""

Burlington City Administrator Carina Walters said the city consolidated two in-person voting locations into a single drive-thru site at its Department of Public Works garage. The city received PPE from the Racine County Emergency Operations Center, plus some from the Burlington Fire Department.
Burlington provided all poll workers with the same equipment Vos wore and also took their temperatures before and after shifts, Walters said.
""Our PPE policy for the day was to treat all persons as if they had COVID-19,"" she said.
A look across the state
Vos was not the only poll worker wearing a gown, mask and gloves in Burlington. Beyond that protection, Vos’ tweet also shows other workers (not him) wearing face shields. 
But the Facebook post did not specify Burlington. The original poster told PolitiFact Wisconsin he preferred to let it speak for itself.
So what kind of PPE did poll workers in other communities use?
The Wisconsin Elections Commission provided surgical masks and gloves to local clerks, along with sanitizing products. Gowns and face shields were not included, per the commission’s April 3, 2020 memo.
Milwaukee County provided municipalities with surgical masks and gloves but did not have access to gowns, said County Clerk George Christenson. Election workers in the city of Milwaukee had gowns, masks and gloves, but no eye shields, according to Election Commission Executive Director Neil Albrecht.
Madison put poll workers behind a glass barrier and offered gloves, along with face shields for people working in close proximity. Poll workers in Green Bay also sat behind a glass barrier and wore masks, but not gowns.
Vos’ wife, Michelle Litjens Vos, only wore gloves at a polling place in Rochester, the Journal Times reported.
That means many people in Wisconsin worked the polls on Election Day and didn’t look at all like Vos. Still, poll workers outside Burlington had access to some of the same equipment he did.
Our ruling
A Facebook post shared widely chastised Vos for wearing protective gear at the polls that ""election workers he forced to work today do not have.""
Other poll workers in Burlington wore the same gear as Vos, so he didn’t receive any special treatment there like the claim implies. Poll workers in other parts of the state had some – but not necessarily all – of the same equipment used by Vos.

Facebook posts","Widely shared Facebook posts mislead on COVID-19 mortality rate




If Your Time is short





The CDC has not “confirmed” any mortality rate for COVID-19.


The Facebook posts draw on the low-end of a range of estimates the CDC published in May saying the fatality rate for those showing symptoms was between 0.2% and 1%, with a ""best estimate"" of 0.4%. The estimated overall mortality rate of those with and without symptoms would be 0.26%. 


Several health experts said they project the mortality rate is on the higher-end of the CDC’s estimated range, closer to 1%, which is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.





See the sources for this fact-check




Determining the death rate of COVID-19 is a big challenge, especially at this still-early stage in the pandemic. 
Health officials and epidemiologists say there are many unknowns: How many people got infected but were never tested? How many died of the disease without being counted as coronavirus deaths? 
The answer is a moving target and at least one health expert believes it could be many months before a precise mortality rate is known. 
""We won’t know until a year from now,"" said Thomas Novotny, professor emeritus of epidemiology and biostatistics at San Diego State University. ""There’s so much we don’t know."" 
That uncertainty, however, hasn’t stopped claims from catapulting across social media saying the severity of the virus was overblown.
Posts cut and pasted and shared thousands of times on Facebook and Instagram say: ""The CDC just confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19,"" suggesting the rate is far lower than officials previously reported. The posts also claim that government officials misled the public about the number of coronavirus deaths and argue that closing down the economy wasn’t necessary. 

This is a screenshot of one of the many misleading and widely spread Facebook posts that claims the CDC ""confirmed"" a 0.2% mortality rate for COVID-19. The federal agency hasn’t established a mortality rate for the disease. 
Several of these posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook).
The posts, some of which implore readers to ""make this viral,"" include multiple misleading and false statements. But for this fact check, we decided to focus on whether the CDC has really ""confirmed"" a 0.2% mortality rate and to offer some context on the lethality of the virus. We will base our rating on that specific claim.
Background On Mortality Figures
On March 3, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died. That figure is what epidemiologists call a ""case fatality rate."" 
The ratio is ""crudely calculated by dividing the number of reported deaths over the number of reported confirmed cases,"" Carla Drysdale, a WHO spokeswoman, told PolitiFact National in March. She also said the ratio would change over time and vary from place to place. 
But the mortality rate, or ""death rate"" as the Facebook posts terms it, is much more difficult to determine. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who die from COVID-19 in a certain geographic area by the total estimated number of people infected. It doesn’t rely solely on confirmed deaths and infections.
The biggest problem is the denominator. Many who develop mild cases of COVID-19 or show no signs at all are never tested and thus aren’t counted, skewing the ratio. 
Did The CDC Really ‘Confirm’ A 0.2% Death Rate?
The Facebook post’s claim that the CDC ""confirmed"" a 0.2% death rate draws on information in a planning document the federal agency published in May. The 0.2% figure is included, but it’s the lowest in a range of five estimates. Earlier this month, USA Today analyzed the five scenarios in the document while fact-checking the same claim about a 0.2% death rate that had spread widely on Facebook and Instagram. 
""The first four are varying estimates of the disease's severity, from low to high, while the fifth represents the 'current best estimate,'"" USA Today reported. ""The range of estimates put the fatality rate for those showing symptoms between 0.2%-1%, with a 'best estimate' of 0.4%. It also places the number of asymptomatic cases between 20%-50%, with a 'best estimate' of 35%. By combining the two estimates, the estimated overall fatality rate of those infected with the virus – with and without symptoms – would be 0.26%."" 
The USA Today fact check concluded that saying the CDC has ""confirmed"" 0.2% as the death rate ""paints a misleading picture because the CDC has clearly stated the number is subject to change.
Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the claim in the social media posts is simply ""wrong. The CDC did not confirm that."" He estimated COVID-19’s death rate at ""between 0.8% and 1.0%."" 
""No serious examination of the data from this pandemic would lead one to conclude that 0.2% is a realistic possibility,"" Jha wrote in an email.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The Facebook posts also attribute several quotes to ""the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute."" An online search shows Jha made similar statements, but on a completely separate topic. 
""This is pretty stunning to me — my quote being misused to promote a falsehood,"" Jha said, noting he had not been aware of the posts before being contacted by PolitiFact California.
Several health experts have described the CDC estimates as low and lacking in transparency. 
Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, 
questioned the CDC’s 0.26% mortality rate, saying ""it’s not transparent where that comes from.""
""That’s very much on the low-end of what’s been reported by good studies,"" he added. 
The CDC did not respond to a request for comment. 
Health officials have cited a May study from the University of Washington, which estimated that if all infections were known, the true death rate for Americans who show symptoms would be about 1.3%.
From a public health perspective, Jewell said that claims like the one spreading on Facebook can ""do a lot of damage, largely because when it’s seized on, it undercuts your message"" to continue social distancing and wearing masks. 
""The whole idea that this wasn’t so bad is just, in my view, nonsense,"" Jewell said.
Asked about the mortality rate claim in the Facebook posts, Novotny, the professor of epidemiology at San Diego State University, said ""it misrepresents what the risks are."" 
Comparing COVID 19’s Mortality Rate To Influenza
In March, Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told PolitiFact National that most experts believe the ultimate death rate for this coronavirus will wind up being higher than the rate for seasonal flu, which hovers around 0.1%.
That lines up with what Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress during his March testimony.
""The percent mortality will depend on what the denominator of number of cases is,"" Fauci said. ""So if you’re not counting every case, the mortality will be high. If you are counting a lot of cases that are sub-clinical, mortality will become low. But no matter how you slice it, it’s many, many, many more times lethal than the influenza that we get in the season.""
Our ruling
Facebook posts claim the CDC ""confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19."" 
The claim draws from the low-end of a range of estimates the CDC published in May saying the fatality rate for those showing symptoms was between 0.2% and 1%, with a ""best estimate"" of 0.4%. The estimated overall mortality rate of those with and without symptoms would be 0.26%. 
Health experts, however, said it’s difficult to pin down a precise mortality rate early in a pandemic and that the federal agency hasn’t yet ""confirmed"" any rate but instead offered best guesses. Over time, it is possible that estimates will show a lower than initially expected mortality rate, especially as more testing is conducted in the United States. 
Currently, however, the true number of deaths and infections are hard to determine, as some deaths caused by the virus aren’t counted and many people with mild cases of the coronavirus are never tested. 
Several experts said they project the mortality rate is on the higher-end of the CDC’s estimated range, closer to 1%, which is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. 
In the end, the post wrongly suggests that health officials have established COVID-19’s true mortality rate and selectively picks the low-end of a range of estimates. 
We rate the claim Mostly False.

Ron Johnson","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson confuses and misses on claim about COVID-19 deaths




If Your Time is short





A spokesman for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said this statement was in reference to deaths across the United States, which have been steady.


But to suggest the United States has “flattened the curve” of new cases is not accurate.


Plus, Johnson said this as he discussed Wisconsin, which is seeing record numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths.





See the sources for this fact-check




U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has raised eyebrows more than once during the coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier this year, he noted most people survive COVID-19 and argued governments shouldn’t shut down economies to contain the virus. The senator himself tested positive in early October and said he would wear a moon suit if needed to vote in person to confirm Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
On Oct. 21, 2020, Johnson, a Republican, made another comment that turned heads in Wisconsin, where cases of COVID-19 continue to skyrocket and overwhelm hospitals. 
""Unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve,"" he said on a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce. ""We’ve gotten better at treating it.""
Is he right that deaths are ""pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve""?
Let’s dig in. 
COVID-19 deaths in Wisconsin
Johnson’s claim came as part of his legislative update for the WMC, the state’s largest business lobby. Here’s his full statement about COVID-19 deaths, which he made after WMC president and CEO Kurt Bauer asked the senator how he was feeling: 
""I think it’s important to note, and I heard a little bit of your earlier presenter, as we’re struggling with, there’s no doubt about it, a surge in cases — we had another record day yesterday in COVID — unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve, we’ve gotten better at treating it, we know about the anti-inflammatories and steroids and convalescent plasma, which will hopefully be available here shortly.""
According to the state Department of Health Services, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wisconsin are at their highest ever. The state’s worst day came Oct. 21 — the same day Johnson made this claim — when officials reported 48 deaths, surpassing a previous record of 34 reported on Oct. 13. As of Oct. 22, 2020, the seven-day average for deaths sat at 21.
In the spring, by contrast, the number of deaths reported in one day peaked at 22, and the seven-day average never surpassed 13.
""Of course the curve has not flattened and we don't have the virus under control,"" Patrick Remington, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist and director of the preventive medicine residency program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Flattened the curve?
When asked for evidence to support the senator’s claim, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson was ""talking about flattening the curve of deaths nationally — ‘generally,’ as he puts it."" Voelkel said that statement is supported by statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York Times. 
But Johnson began by mentioning the recent spikes in Wisconsin and was speaking to a group of Wisconsin business leaders, leaving listeners with the impression that he meant death numbers here. He made no attempt to distinguish statewide trends from national.

By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







Johnson also revisited the point during a telephone town hall the next day, saying ""we can see the light at the tunnel nationally on this.""
""We have a dramatic increase in cases in Wisconsin,"" he said. ""And again, the good news is, if you do look at the number of deaths, those have kicked up as well, but it’s still relatively flat. It hasn’t followed the same uptick in terms of number of cases.""
Let’s take a look at the national data cited by Johnson’s staff. 
According to the New York Times, daily reported coronavirus deaths peaked in mid-April, with some days exceeding 2,700 nationwide. More recently, that number ranged from 267 deaths on Sept. 27 to 1,208 on Oct. 21. However, the more telling seven-day average largely stayed in the 700s over the past month.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks deaths weekly, pointed to similar trends: a peak in mid-April followed by a slight increase around August and a decline since early September. 
So, from that perspective, Johnson’s claim is more on point. Deaths have decreased overall since the pandemic’s onset, and seven-day averages reported by the New York Times remained steady in recent weeks even as daily numbers fluctuated. 
There is a problem here, though. Johnson attributes the ""pretty flat"" deaths in part to a flattening of the curve, which typically refers to the number of cases. And the United States clearly has not flattened the curve. 
As Johns Hopkins University has noted, flattening the curve ""involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next"" to help prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. 
Data from the university show the United States is doing the opposite — the seven-day average has risen steadily since September. 
Our ruling
On a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, Johnson said, ""Generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve.""
Cases are up nationwide and in Wisconsin, so the curve of new cases has not been flattened. And deaths in Wisconsin are at an all-time high, even if nationally they have been more stable. 
A Johnson spokesman argued the senator was referring to national trends when he spoke. However, he made the claim in the context of discussing the situation in Wisconsin, and even if one were to use a national perspective, he’s only partially correct.
A statement is Mostly False when it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Joe Biden","Biden falsely says Trump administration rejected WHO coronavirus test kits (that were never offered)




If Your Time is short





The WHO never offered to sell test kits to the United States.


The CDC opted to develop its own coronavirus test and did not use the WHO’s protocol for the test. 


Other developed countries with advanced research capabilities developed their own tests.





See the sources for this fact-check




During Sunday night’s debate, while levelling criticism at President Donald Trump’s handling of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joe Biden said the Trump administration refused to get coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization. 
""Look, the World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own,"" Biden said. 
A similar claim on WHO test kits has also been circulating on Facebook. 
The Biden campaign referred us to a Politico article that said the WHO shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is technically correct, but it suggests that the United States would have been on the list under any circumstances.
The countries WHO helped are ones that lack the virology lab horsepower that exists across the United States. The outreach work by the Pan American Health Organization is a case in point.
The group is WHO’s arm in the Americas. It conducted trainings and sent materials to conduct tests to 29 nations. The list included Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and many others.
The group said it focused most of its efforts on ""countries with the weakest health systems.""
""No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,"" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. ""This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.""
According to interviews with several infectious disease experts, Biden’s statement leaves out key context regarding how different countries decided on which test they’d use to identify the presence of the coronavirus. 
WHO lists seven different approaches — including that of China, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, France and Germany — each one targeting different parts of the COVID-19 genetic profile. 
Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, said that when faced with an outbreak, the WHO will usually adopt the best test that a research group brings forward. 
The German one became the approach WHO circulated as its preferred model.
Aid groups, such as the Pan American Health Organization, took that model and built their training and supplies around it. If the model was like the recipe in a cookbook, the supplies were the ingredients in a home meal kit from Blue Apron.
Any country could use whatever recipe it preferred, and even if the United States had picked the WHO’s protocol, it wouldn’t need the WHO to sell it the materials to follow it. Germany released its protocol on Jan. 17, but the U.S. decided to have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention develop its own. That protocol was published Jan. 28.

The CDC’s test was different and more complicated than the German test. It worked in the CDC lab, but when the materials went out to state labs, some of them got inconsistent results. The CDC had to resend packages with new chemical reagents. 
State laboratories started developing their own tests and were ready to use them, but had to wait for emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. All of this added up to a delay in testing capabilities which resulted in fewer Americans being tested and an overall slower U.S. response compared to other countries. 
When asked to respond to Biden’s claim, the Trump campaign pointed to multiple news stories that said it's not uncommon for the U.S. and other countries to develop their own tests during outbreaks, and that the CDC did so during Ebola and Zika outbreaks. The campaign also said the CDC's test had a quick turnaround compared to other diagnostic tests like MERS and Zika that took months to develop. And the issue with the CDC’s protocol was not the test itself, but rather a manufacturing defect, the campaign added. 
That’s not how it works 
While it might seem odd that the Trump administration shunned the WHO’s coronavirus test protocol, it’s normal for countries with advanced research capabilities to want to develop a measure that they trust. 
""I don’t know if WHO agreed to sell the kits to us, but it should never have been something we needed to do given our technological expertise and the fact we would have ‘taken kits from low- and middle-income countries’ that otherwise could not make or afford them,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, in an email. 
It’s also unlikely, Mores said, that the WHO offered to sell kits to the U.S., because that’s not normally what the organization does. 
""In my experience, this is never something that I would have to purchase,"" he said. 
Typically, Mores said, American labs have all of the basic ingredients and equipment to run the test — all that would be needed is the viral sequences and an exact test protocol. The only catch at the moment is that supplies of those basic ingredients are stretched thin due to high demand.
Our ruling
Biden said, ""The World Health Organization offered, offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them."" 
Biden has a point that the U.S. did not attempt to use the WHO test. But the U.S. would never have needed complete kits from WHO. Even if it had adopted the WHO testing approach, it already had access to all the necessary materials. 
WHO said there was never any talk of WHO sending testing kits to the United States.
Biden’s words leave out other important context and information. 
The U.S. chose to use its own test, rather than the one circulated by WHO. Other nations, such as China, Japan and France, also developed their own tests. Multiple public health experts said that is not unusual. 
Biden’s emphasis on WHO offering kits is simply wrong.

Democratic Party of Wisconsin","Dems exaggerate in slamming Trump farm bailouts as “handout for large agricultural companies”




If Your Time is short





There have been two farm bailouts under Trump, alleviating impact from trade wars and the coronavirus pandemic.


The trade aid program drew criticism for skewing toward large farms: 10% of farms got 55% of the payouts.


We don’t yet have such breakdowns for the coronavirus program, but it has stricter limits and higher average payouts, indicating less money going to the largest farms.


It's a significant exaggeration to say money is only going to large industrial farms.





See the sources for this fact-check




Shortly before President Donald Trump’s latest visit to Wisconsin, state Democrats leveled a series of attacks on his agriculture policies.
A June 18, 2020, news release from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin asserted Trump’s ""failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin"" and criticized the president’s trade war with China. Then it turned to the recent federal bailout efforts.
""Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his re-election chances,"" the release said. ""He used their pain to push through a multi-billion-dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies.""
It’s a key topic in Wisconsin, where 36 farmers filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2020 alone, compared to 57 in all of 2019. 
Have Trump’s bailouts really helped only the largest farming operations?
Bailouts operated under different limits
The government provides billions of dollars to farmers through an array of programs, including crop insurance and commodity programs to help farmers survive low yields or low prices, and various disaster aid.
But the Wisconsin Democrats’ reference to ""bailouts"" narrows the focus to the two recent programs that provided additional aid to farmers.
The Market Facilitation Program paid out more than $14 billion in 2018 and 2019 to mitigate impacts from trade wars, and the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program — announced in April — is intended to provide up to $19 billion for farmers affected by the pandemic.
Farm involved in directly producing crops were eligible, including large industrial farm operations.
Here’s what we know about who got that money.
Payments from the Market Facilitation Program have skewed heavily to large farms, according to the Environmental Working Group, which describes itself as a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment. The group obtained detailed data through October 2019 via Freedom of Information Act requests.
Through that point, 55% of payments went to the top (largest) 10% of farmers — an average of $128,000 per recipient. Just 25% of payments went to the lowest 80% of farmers — an average of $7,000.

""This money really does go to the largest farms, and the smallest farms are the ones that need it the most,"" said Anne Schechinger, senior economics analyst with the group.
The overall average was $23,000 per recipient.
Large farms could collect a higher share of the money in the market program because of a loophole in the maximum payment policy, Schechinger noted in a July 2019 Washington Post story. Payouts were capped at $250,000 per person, but many farms are set up as partnerships, so each partner could receive that amount — even if there were a dozen or more.
The second bailout, addressing the coronavirus impact, limited the payouts to three shareholders, so $750,000 per farm. The coronavirus program also generally limits the aid to farms with average annual income of $900,000 or less from 2016 to 2018.
The payments have changed somewhat as a result.
As of June 15, 2020 — the latest available data at the time of the Wisconsin Democrats’ news release — the average payment under the coronavirus program was $13,000. That could mean fewer farms were getting massive payouts. (The average rose to about $15,000 in the June 29, 2020, update)
But that’s the most detail we have on the coronavirus program, since the government hasn’t yet released a breakdown of individual payments. So there’s no way for the state Democratic Party to prove this element of their claim.
The coronavirus program is ongoing, with applications accepted through Aug. 28, 2020. Producers are eligible if they have suffered a 5% or greater loss during the pandemic.
Our ruling
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed in a news release that bailouts under Trump have been ""nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies.""
The first of the two farm bailouts did indeed skew toward large farms, with 10% of recipients receiving 55% of the funding.
We don’t yet have detailed data on the second bailout that would conclusively confirm or rebut this claim, so the state Democratic party can’t prove whether their assertion holds true for this program. But we do know the government changed the payment caps to limit how much the largest farms can receive.
And the claim wasn’t simply that payments skewed toward large farms, it was that the bailouts were ""nothing more than a handout"" for large producers. That’s a significant exaggeration.

Facebook posts","Despite all the talk, COVID-19 vaccination does not infect people with shingles




If Your Time is short




COVID-19 vaccinations do not infect recipients with shingles or any form of herpes virus, despite some misleading headlines. It is plausible, but unproven, that COVID-19 vaccines could fuel a reactivation of existing, but dormant, herpes virus in some people.
An Israeli study found that six women out of a group of nearly 500 people came down with shingles in the days and weeks following vaccination. All six had autoimmune diseases making them more susceptible to shingles. Also, the study was not designed to determine cause and effect.
Some other vaccines have shown to reactivate the virus that causes shingles, but so far there is no definitive proof that COVID-19 vaccines do so.




See the sources for this fact-check




Posts are showing up all over social media tying COVID-19 vaccinations to shingles and other painful skin disorders.
The source of one such post was Alex Berenson, an author and vaccine critic whose posts are sometimes cited for misinformation.
Berenson posted — first on Twitter, which then found its way to Facebook — a photo of a man covered in a severe rash. The man, according to the post, blamed the skin outbreak on a COVID vaccination he had weeks earlier. The post also included unsubstantiated information purported to be from the man’s doctors, indicating a likely diagnosis of a type of rash usually triggered by medications or infections, such as herpes simplex. It led Berenson to draw the conclusion that ""for #Covid vaccines, shingles and even more dangerous and painful skin conditions may be the new thrombocytopenia."" That is a reference to a low blood platelet condition reported among some people who experienced blood clots after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.)
Without more information, it’s impossible to know whether the picture was as described, or what might have led to the man’s condition. We reached out to Berenson by email, but he did not respond. However, in a related Twitter thread, Berenson went on to discuss a study conducted in Israel that looked at six shingles cases occurring post-vaccination in a group of about 500 people with immune disorders.
The small Israeli study drew wide attention on social media and other outlets, and currently is the most-read article in the British Medical Journal’s Rheumatology. Some outlets, including the New York Post, ran stories on its findings, often with misleading headlines.
That got us wondering: How strong is the science behind this connection?
First, a little background
Shingles, also called herpes zoster, occurs in people who had chickenpox, a virus that causes itchy blisters. (Shingles can be prevented by the two-dose Shingrix vaccine.)
After a person recovers from chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus that causes it can lie dormant in the body, and then reactivate years or decades later in the form of shingles. Both are part of the herpes virus family, which includes herpes simplex Types 1 and 2.
Type 1 commonly causes ""cold"" sores around the mouth and lips and is spread by kissing or sharing things like toothbrushes. Type 2 can cause genital herpes, which is spread via sexual contact.
Among the things that can reactivate these dormant herpes viruses are stress, drugs that suppress the immune system or simply aging.
Now, back to those social media posts
Neither the picture of the man with a rash or the findings of the small study in Israel prove cause and effect. In other words, just because a rash follows a vaccine by days or weeks does not mean the vaccine caused the rash.
Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said it’s natural for people to link events that occur within a short span of time, but he stressed it doesn’t prove causality.
""Just because B follows A doesn’t mean A causes B,"" he said.
In considering whether there are links between a treatment and a side effect, researchers often follow two large groups of similar people, one group getting a particular medication or vaccine, the other not. If the vaccinated or medicated individuals experience a side effect at a greater rate than those not treated, there may be a connection.
Safety is also monitored by tracking data on reported side effects.

In the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System includes unverified reports from patients, doctors and others about possible illnesses or symptoms that occur following immunizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention watches those reports.
""So far, the data indicates that shingles and herpes are not occurring at an increased rate in the vaccinated population,"" said Schaffner, who encourages people who get a rash of any kind — or shingles — following vaccination to report it through that system.
But what about that Israeli study?
Even its authors said it was not designed to find a cause and effect.
Instead, the study followed 491 people — all of whom were being treated for underlying autoimmune inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, making them more susceptible to shingles in general.
Out of those, six women ages 36 to 61 developed shingles in the days and weeks after they received the Pfizer vaccination, for a prevalence rate of 1.2%.
The researchers noted in their article that vaccine-related reactivation of shingles has been seen with other vaccines, such as those for influenza, hepatitis A and rabies. But there were no reports of herpes-related rashes in the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.
In the study, most of the cases were mild, five occurred after the first dose, and all five of those women went on to have their second dose with no additional adverse effects. The researchers said their observations cannot prove causality but should prompt ""further vigilance and safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination side effects.""
Some media outlets, including the New York Post, ran headlines such as ""Herpes Infection Possibly Linked to COVID-19, Study Says.""
That’s simply ""clickbait,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
No one is getting infected with herpes from vaccinations, he said. ""What the anti-vax community is doing is giving the impression that vaccinations are giving people herpes, which is simply not true.""
Adalja objects to the headline and effort to scare people, but he also said it is plausible, if yet unproven, that vaccination could reactivate an existing herpes zoster virus.
Other types of rashes and injection-site redness have certainly been reported by people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine.
Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, reported on a group of 12 patients who had rashes that appeared four to 11 days after getting their first dose of the Moderna vaccine. Ice and antihistamines were used to treat most of the patients, half of whom experienced a rash again after the second shot.
And there have been reports on social media and in the press of people reporting similar rashes following vaccination. Still, experts say those rashes may simply be a sign that the immune system is working.
Such rashes are ""pretty innocuous and easily treated,"" said Adalja.
Our ruling
An online post claims the COVID-19 vaccines cause shingles or other dangerous skin conditions.
Although it contains a sliver of truth, it ignores important information. For instance, the evidence to date indicates this is an area to continue monitoring, but no direct link has been established between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles or other serious skin conditions.
The study cited was not intended to prove cause and effect, and it was looking at patients who already had suppressed immune systems that made them more likely to get shingles whether they had a vaccination or not.

Chris Murphy","Senator forgets key context about UNC's COVID-19 testing




If Your Time is short




U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said that ""14% of students tested positive” at the University of North Carolina.
The way he phrased the tweet could give the impression that more than 2,600 of UNC's 19,000 undergraduates are infected.
That's not the case. About 14% of tests recently came back positive -- and that figure comes from a sample size of only 954 students.




See the sources for this fact-check




The University of North Carolina made national news after reporting a coronavirus outbreak shortly after students returned to campus.
Before students could even get their first assignments, university administrators abandoned their plans to hold in-person classes. The football team, however, is still scheduled to move forward with a modified Atlantic Coast Conference schedule.
That upset U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. The University of Connecticut was the first major football program to cancel its season due to the pandemic.
""Notre Dame and UNC are sending kids home because of COVID outbreaks (at UNC 14% of students tested positive),"" Murphy tweeted on Aug. 18, adding: ""But...not football players! They need to stay no matter the risk, because the college football money machine needs to keep churning.""
His tweet linked to a New York Times story about the situation at UNC. 
Murphy was clearly trying to make a point about college athletes being exploited. While doing so, however, he failed to provide the full context of UNC’s outbreak.
Is it true that 14% of students tested positive, as Murphy said? Not exactly.
The percentage Murphy quoted is generally accurate. It’s what the percentage represents that he didn’t properly convey.
Murphy’s tweet could give the impression that 14% of all students tested positive. That would mean that more than 2,670 of UNC’s 19,117 undergraduate students have COVID-19. 
But that’s not the case. 
While some schools (including Duke University) required students to be tested before entering campus, UNC didn’t. UNC encourages students to be tested if they believe they have been exposed to the virus.
In the week from Aug. 10 to 16, 954 students were tested. Of those, 130 — or 13.6% — tested positive. The university updates its testing numbers weekly on its online dashboard.

Is it fair to say that the week’s infection rate for those who were tested accurately reflects the entire UNC student population? No.
Because UNC is only testing people who think they need it, the results are likely to skewed, said Donald Taylor, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Duke University.
""UNC is doing ‘symptomatic’ testing when folks are feeling sick, and contact tracing testing when you ask a person newly infected to say who they have been in close contact with, and then those folks are tested,"" Taylor said.
""People who feel sick, or who were in close contact with those who are positive would be expected to have a much higher rate of ‘positivity’ than would an entire population,"" Taylor said.
If it was a random sample of students, you could extrapolate, ""but would need to say it is a rough estimate,"" said Peter Ubel, a physician and behavioral scientist at the Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business.
""If they tested symptomatic students, or ones with known exposures, then that suggests the 14% figure is higher than probably seen across the student body,"" Ubel said.
UNC spokespersons emailed PolitiFact to reiterate that the 14% positivity rate ""does not reflect all students."" It represents only students ""who took a COVID-19 test and had a positive result for coronavirus that week.""
As for Murphy, his office doesn’t believe the tweet is misleading at all.
""Senator Murphy didn’t say it was 14% of all students,"" Murphy spokesperson Jamie Geller said. ""He said it was 14%, with no qualifier, which logically infers that it’s of those who are tested. But in case there was any confusion, he linked to the article.""
We disagree with the notion that Murphy’s tweet clearly refers only to students who were tested. 
Our ruling
Murphy tweeted that ""at UNC 14% of students tested positive.""
Someone who reads Murphy’s tweet could understand that he’s referring to the small sample of students who were tested. But, on its face, the tweet could give the impression that more than 2,600 students contracted COVID-19.

Joe Biden","Joe Biden exaggerates support among economists for his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan




If Your Time is short





Economists across the political spectrum back the idea of a substantial spending package to tackle the coronavirus and repair the damage it did to people’s lives and the economy.


Economists differ greatly on the right amount of money Washington should spend, and how it should target the money.





See the sources for this fact-check




President Joe Biden has made beating the coronavirus and repairing the economic damage it unleashed his defining priorities. The central pillar of his strategy is a $1.9 trillion recovery plan.
At a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, host Anderson Cooper asked Biden if he was committed to passing a $1.9 trillion bill, or if the number was up for negotiation.
Biden responded as though there was no need for discussion. He said support for his package came from ""economists left, right and center.""
""The overwhelming consensus is: In order to grow the economy a year or two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much,"" Biden said Feb. 16. ""Now is the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big.""
Economists across the political spectrum have indeed embraced delivering substantial relief, but when it comes to the total price tag, there’s more debate than he describes.
Including among Democrats.
In early February, former Obama administration Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers voiced concerns. In a Washington Post op-ed, Summers warned that while the bill had to be big, there was a risk of overshoot. Spending too much on COVID-19, Summers said, would squeeze out money for other big plans, from infrastructure to renewable energy to preschool.
""After resolving the coronavirus crisis, how will political and economic space be found for the public investments that should be the nation’s highest priority?"" Summers wrote.
Summers was not alone.
The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, said $1.9 trillion was ""too much."" Blanchard agreed with the plan’s main goals — spending on vaccines and health care, protecting the people who lost jobs and boosting demand. But Blanchard didn’t reach Biden’s total.
""When you make the sum of all these needs, which are real and have to be satisfied, you don't get to $1.9 trillion. You get to a smaller number,"" Blanchard said Feb. 8.
Blanchard’s ballpark number was $1 trillion.
Desmond Lachman, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, agreed that there is consensus across the ideological spectrum in favor of additional economic stimulus. The supporters include Lachman’s onetime colleague at the institute Kevin Hassett, who joined the Trump administration as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Hassett told CNN that he broadly supports Biden’s $1.9 trillion package.
But Lachman said there’s uneven support for that level of spending.

""There are many economists who think that a package as large as a $1.9 trillion package is inviting trouble,"" Lachman said.
Lachman, like the other more cautious economists, worries about overheating the economy with too much cash. The resulting inflation would lead to higher interest rates, which, Lachman argues, would send world financial markets into a tailspin. 
Ever eager to foster stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve offered calming words on that front. Chairman Jerome Powell said Feb. 10 that if a burst of spending drives prices up, he doesn’t think it would last, nor would it automatically trigger a rate increase.
A recent survey puts some numbers to the range of opinions among economists.
In January, the Wall Street Journal asked over 60 economists how much stimulus is needed. A bit more than half said less than $1 trillion would do. Just under half preferred an amount between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. 
Now, this was strictly a question about economic stimulus. Biden’s plan includes about $160 billion for coronavirus programs, and other pieces might come under the same umbrella. But at some top-line level, economists disagree over the size of the proposal.
Jason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, suggested making the Biden plan more flexible. If economic growth remained weak after some initial stimulus, Furman would extend the aid for a longer time. If not, the government could dial back its spending.
""These provisions could also phase out aid more quickly than Mr. Biden proposes if the economy rebounds faster than expected,"" Furman wrote Jan. 25, 2021.
Samuel Hammond with the Niskanen Center, a group named after an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, joined over 120 economists in a letter that called for ""substantial"" relief. But Hammond said he agrees with the concerns raised by Summers, and has reservations about a major part of the Biden plan: $350 billion for state and local governments.
""I think Larry (Summers) has been making some decent points about COVID relief, and the longer-term benefits of prioritizing public investments rather than a ton of state and local fiscal aid,"" Hammond said.
The White House press office staff noted that support has come from top Democratic and Republican economists, and they pointed to statements from leading business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable. But while those statements push for strong action, they are not specific about a dollar figure.
""We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on the details and in ensuring that any additional economic assistance is timely, targeted, and temporary, "" the Chamber of Commerce said Jan. 14.
That leaves plenty of room for discussion about the scale of the relief package.
Our ruling
Biden said that economists across the political spectrum supported his COVID-19 relief proposal. There is broad agreement that Washington should spend hundreds of billions of dollars to corral the coronavirus, help small businesses and give assistance to the millions of people who lost their jobs.
But Biden treated that support as an endorsement of his entire $1.9 trillion plan.
Many prominent economists have concerns about the price tag, which was the exact focus of the question Biden was answering.

Tucker Carlson","Tucker Carlson says coronavirus isn’t as deadly as we thought. Experts disagree




If Your Time is short





Reputable scientists warned early in the outbreak that there was not a totally accurate picture of how deadly the coronavirus was. There’s still not. 


It’s misleading to compare, as Carlson did, the early reported case fatality rates, which reflect deaths among confirmed COVID-19 patients, with more recent infection fatality rates that estimate the death rate for all infected people.


COVID-19 still appears more lethal than the seasonal flu, experts said. Infection fatality rates that may seem small can lead to mounting death tolls.





See the sources for this fact-check




Fox News host Tucker Carlson railed against continued statewide shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, claiming in a recent TV segment that they did little to flatten the curve and that ""the virus just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.""
Citing recent studies from hotspots such as New York, Carlson said the virus is ""a full order of magnitude less deadly"" than public health officials warned. 
""The virus just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was, all of us, including on this show,"" he said. ""Everybody thought it was, but it turned out not to be.""

More than 65,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s in spite of widespread mitigation efforts to reduce the spread. So how deadly is it?
Estimating the lethality of COVID-19 has been a key question for epidemiologists. In the middle of a pandemic, moving targets make the death rate difficult to pin down.
But experts told us Carlson’s statement is off-track. Many early mortality estimates were based on official counts of confirmed cases, but epidemiologists were consistent in saying those raw numbers didn’t reflect the virus’s deadliness with complete precision.
The numbers can be confusing
Ideally, epidemiologists could divide the number of deaths by the number of infections to calculate what’s known as the ""infection fatality rate."" But there’s no way to get a complete count of the number of infected individuals, largely because so many mild cases go unreported. 
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said there could be as many as 12.5 COVID-19 infections for every confirmed case in the U.S. 
Still, scientists work with the data they have, even if it’s evolving and varies with patient demographics and location. Some of the first widely reported death rates were what are called ""case fatality rates,"" which are calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of reported cases. 
On March 3, for example, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died — a case fatality rate.
Experts told us at the time that the 3.4% was only a snapshot, and one that likely undercounted people with mild symptoms. A WHO spokesperson said it would ""change over time.""
The global case fatality rate has actually risen since then. As of May 3, the WHO had tallied 3,349,786 confirmed cases worldwide and 238,628 deaths, for a case fatality rate of about 7%.
Now, tests for antibodies in the blood of people exposed to the coronavirus are offering the first glimpses at what the infection fatality rate could be in states such as New York and California.
The tests haven’t all been as accurate as many experts would like, and the studies of them haven’t all been peer-reviewed. ""It remains very clear that we do not know the precise mortality of COVID-19 infection,"" said the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Myron Cohen.
But their preliminary results suggested the infection fatality rate may be below 1%, handing fodder to some who say the COVID-19 threat is overblown.
Carlson said the new information shows COVID-19 is less deadly than expected.
On his show, he cited widely disputed findings from two California doctors. A Fox News spokesperson also pointed to a White House press conference, a JP Morgan chart, and recent antibody studies in California and New York to support it.
But Shaman, the epidemiologist, said Carlson was ""cherry-picking evidence.""
Many early figures were case fatality rates, while the estimates reported as a result of recent antibody studies are infection fatality rates. They shouldn’t be conflated, Shaman said.

By Bill McCarthy • June 9, 2021







Seemingly small infection fatality rates can also cause mounting deaths. The New York study showed the state’s infection fatality rate to be around 0.5%, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. 
That matches estimates from a model Shaman constructed, which he said put the U.S. infection fatality rate at 0.56%. But in a worst-case scenario where 70% of Americans are infected, a 0.5% rate could amount to 1.2 million U.S. deaths, Shaman said. 
And as we’ve reported, the death toll may be higher than we know. 
The infection fatality rate for the flu, which kills thousands of Americans annually, hovers under 0.1% and is calculated annually using a mathematical model that estimates the disease burden.
Carlson’s sources aren’t foolproof
There are other problems with Carlson’s sources, including the clip he played of one of two California physicians who gained national attention for calling to end the shutdowns.
The doctors, who own an urgent care clinic, used the infection rate among patients tested at their clinic to extrapolate to the entire state and put the death rate at a tiny 0.03%. 
The University of Washington’s Carl Bergstrom wrote on Twitter that this amounts to ""sampling bias"" because patients at an urgent care clinic likely think they’re sick. The doctors’ calculations are like ""estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court,"" he said.
 
The video was ""emphatically condemn(ed)"" by the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine; it was also removed from YouTube.
Another report cited by the Fox News spokesperson, from the University of Southern California, followed a controversial study from Stanford University. 
A number of experts have since warned that both studies used antibody tests known to yield false positive results. (A USC spokesperson said results were adjusted to account for that.) 
Many epidemiologists said the infection fatality rate would be lower
Carlson’s claim that COVID-19 was projected to be deadlier for infected patients also discounts what many experts said months ago.
""No one knowledgeable thought it was as deadly as known deaths divided by known cases,"" said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
""Every responsible epidemiologist has been saying that the number of cases is certainly more than those we know about, especially in the U.S., where testing has been inadequate.""
Many experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said preliminary case fatality rates could be inflated. The WHO said early on, including in mid- February, that the infection fatality rate would be lower than the initial case fatality rates. 
The Imperial College of London, which projected in March that the U.S. could see 2.2 million deaths if it had no response, estimated that 0.9% of infected COVID-19 patients would die.
""It is surprisingly mild only to those who were not listening to competent epidemiologists, and it is in fact considerably worse than seasonal flu,"" Lipsitch said.
Our ruling
Carlson said the coronavirus ""just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.""
Scientists warned early in the outbreak that the raw number of confirmed cases didn’t give a fully accurate picture of mortality. 
It’s misleading for Carlson to compare early case fatality rates — which divide the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases — with newer estimates of the infection fatality rate. The infection fatality rate should be lower, as experts have said for months.
It’s premature to say as a matter of fact that a far rosier picture has emerged.

If Your Time is short



• A bill currently being considered by Congress, called the EARN IT Act, would make it easier for law enforcement to demand information from technology companies about certain users of their services. 
• The bill wouldn’t grant unlimited access. Any request would have to be premised on a link to suspected child exploitation.
• Whether the government would try to push past those boundaries in practice is hotly debated between civil libertarians and law enforcement.



See the sources for this fact-check




A post now circulating on Instagram warns that pending legislation moving through Congress could allow the government to view anyone’s text messages and listen to phone conversations. 
The March 17 post, which received at least 5,000 likes, said, ""While all COVID-19 news has been going on, the U.S. Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption, and it’s been working its way through Congress. If this passes, the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls, essentially removing all privacy from your conversations."" 
The caption of the post refers to the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act of 2020. The post says: 
""EARN IT Act threatens end-to-end encryption. 
""While we’re all distracted by stockpiling latex gloves and toilet paper, there’s a bill tiptoeing through the US Congress that could inflict the backdoor virus that law enforcement agencies have been trying to inflict on encryption for years.
""At least, that’s the interpretation of digital rights advocates who say that the proposed EARN IT Act could harm free speech and data security.""
What’s in the bill?
The bill in question was introduced in March 2020 and given a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 11. 
Here are some key elements of the bill, according to sponsors and media reports: 


The bill amends section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally protects tech companies by saying they are not responsible for what users of their products upload. 


It establishes a national commission to develop best practices to identify and report child exploitation. This commission would consist of the heads of the Justice and Homeland Security departments and the Federal Trade Commission, plus 16 other members appointed by Congress, and the guidelines would be subject to further approvals


If child predators are caught on their systems, tech companies can either comply with these practices or abide by their own practices, as long as they’re approved by the commission. 


The bill allows victims the chance to sue tech companies that don’t comply with practices approved by the commission. 


The impetus for the bill is data showing the volume of child sexual abuse files. Reporting from the New York Times and research collected from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children CyberTipline show that in 2019, there were 16.9 million reports of problematic material, covering 69.1 million photos, videos and files of child sexual abuse, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
How does this problem intersect with encryption?
Encryption is the process of encoding or scrambling a form of communication, such as an email or a text message, so that a key is needed in order to unscramble it, said Hannah Quay-de la Vallee, a senior technologist with the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that supports civil liberties on the internet. This key — think of it as an extra-long password — is used to protect the data that is stored in a particular message.
In encrypted systems that are not ""end to end,"" the tech platform that carries the message holds the keys to encode and decode the message. When two users message each other, Vallee said, ""the first user sends the message to a platform — that is one encrypted stream — and the platform re-encrypts it, sends it to the second user, the receiver of the message, and that’s a separate encryption stream."" 
But an ""end to end"" encryption system means that the two users exchanging the message have their own keys.  
End-to-end systems are more secure because only the two people communicating have keys, not the third-party tech platform over which their messages travel.
But that set-up limits a tech platform’s ability to monitor messages for evidence of abuse or exploitation.

""Absent from the news — Dominion lost their lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell.""












By Tom Kertscher • June 1, 2021







The EARN IT Act’s primary sponsor, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., argues that the bill won’t stop end-to-end encryption. In a press release, he called encryption ""a serious issue in the enforcement of child sexual-abuse material laws.""
In Graham’s view, passage of the bill means that tech companies will be forced to address child exploitation occurring on their networks. He argues that this is a narrow intervention and dismisses assertions that it is a slippery slope to wider government access to private data.
""Our goal is bring these companies to the table and give them a choice: Prevent the exploitation of children online and stop the proliferation of child sexual abuse material, or face the same liability as every other industry in America,"" Graham said in the release. 
Where the post is accurate
The post is partially accurate in spotlighting the tech industry’s concerns surrounding the EARN IT Act.
The bill would require tech companies to provide the government access to certain information falling under the law, specifically that related to child exploitation.
Whether to give the government so-called backdoor access to customer messages and uploads is a long-running debate, going back to at least the 1990s. Historically, it has pitted law enforcement against technology companies and advocates for civil liberties.
Groups representing the tech sector have generally expressed concern about how much power the government should have to access user data in the name of pursuing lawbreakers. Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, released a statement in 2015 responding to the government's attempts to circumvent encryption technology. 
""We deeply appreciate law enforcement's and the national security community’s work to protect us,"" he said, ""but weakening encryption or creating backdoors to encrypted devices and data for use by the good guys would actually create vulnerabilities to be exploited by the bad guys,"" such as hackers.
What the post leaves out
The post leaves out important context about the status and scope of the bill.
For starters, there is no evidence that Congress is  ""sneakily"" advancing it during the coronavirus crisis, when lawmakers are expected to be away from the Capitol for safety reasons, except to pass urgent coronavirus legislation. Neither a committee nor the full Senate has voted on the bill yet, and the Senate will not meet again until at least April 20.
The portion of the post that says ""the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls"" — is also an exaggeration.
The bill in its current form is aimed at preventing the online sexual exploitation of children. It is not a green light for the government to spy on Americans willy nilly. While critics of the bill see it as a slippery slope — and there may be legitimate concern that the law could be abused — the post doesn’t mention any of the limits on the government’s powers.
Charlie Mitchell, editor of Inside Cybersecurity and the author of ""Hacked: The Inside Story of America's Struggle to Secure Cyberspace,"" said the government has for years made its case for securing access to encrypted communications using the most dire scenario — putting a stop to child predators. 
The tech sector tends to argue that once a backdoor is created, it could be exploited for other purposes.
Quay-de la Vallee acknowledged that there is nothing in the EARN IT Act that explicitly limits end-to-end encryption. But it may have that practical effect, she said, since the bill would establish guidelines that require companies to scan communications for illegal materials.
""If companies would have to do this scanning, in order to get this legal protection, then seemingly they’re doing this on behalf of the U.S. government, and that makes them agents of the government. This means that anything they found is now subject to Fourth Amendment unreasonable-search concerns,"" she said. 
Our ruling
The post said, ""While all COVID-19 news has been going on, the U.S. Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption"" which means ""the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls.""
If the EARN IT Act passed — which is not imminent — it would make it easier for law enforcement to demand information from technology companies about certain users of their services. But the bill is receiving public scrutiny and proceeding through Congress in a typical way, so it’s not accurate to describe it as sneaky.
The post is also misleading about the official scope of the act. Far from green-lighting government intrusion into ""all"" messages and calls, any such requests would have to be premised on a link to suspected child exploitation. 
Whether that limitation would hold in practice is hotly debated between civil libertarians and law enforcement.

This claim has been repeated and debated by professionals for the past three months.


Air-quality monitors take 10 seconds on average to adjust to the air quality in an environment, so they are not ideal for measuring the oxygen concentration in a mask where the air being inhaled and exhaled is changing constantly.


While some healthy people wearing N95 masks could be affected by low oxygen concentrations, cotton masks and surgical masks shouldn’t limit oxygen.





See the sources for this fact-check




A two-and-a-half minute video shared thousands of times on social media warns viewers that the protective face masks recommended to stop the spread of coronavirus are not safe for work.
The man in the video uses an air-quality monitor to measure the oxygen saturation under his mask before determining that wearing a mask leads to dangerously low oxygen intake.
This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
We took a closer look at this claim and found it lacks credibility. First, air quality monitors are not applicable for this kind of experiment. Second, scientists say that overall air quality is not generally adversely affected when healthy people wear most types of masks. 
The video
Referencing Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards, the man in the video explains that an environment must be at least 19.5% oxygen for it to be safe for someone to work in. To demonstrate, he puts the hose of the air-quality monitor next to his mouth without a mask on and then shows the camera the 20.6% oxygen reading on the monitor. 
The man then puts on a protective face mask like those recommended to protect against the spread of the coronavirus and again tests the air quality, this time placing the hose underneath the mask. After a few seconds the monitor’s alarm begins to go off and the man explains that this means it is measuring a ""hazardous atmosphere."" After measuring the air for about 17 seconds, he pulls the hose out from under his mask and holds the monitor up to the camera again. The monitor reads 17.4% oxygen. It takes 10 seconds for the monitor’s alarm to stop as it climbs back up to a safe level of 19.5%.
The man pulls off his mask and explains that if you are ""getting headaches and stuff like that, there’s why, because you’re not getting enough oxygen."" He goes on to explain that if ""you are exerted ... it’s only going to get worse from there.""
A similar but longer video post by Pennsylvania state Senate candidate Jeff Neff arrives at a similar conclusion and has gotten thousands of shares.

An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







The OSHA guidelines the man in the video references are correct. OSHA defines an atmosphere that is less than 19.5% oxygen as oxygen deficient. A Department of Labor spokesperson told PolitiFact that OSHA has not determined how face masks impact oxygen levels and caution employers to consider how they use masks in atypical work environments. OSHA promotes the use of personal protective equipment and other safety measures by employers.
As long as the atmosphere outside of your mask is normal and not oxygen deficient, you should be fine. Ben Neuman, a Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist, explained in another fact-check that masks ""won't materially change the makeup of air that comes through the mask.""
The oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in a mask are constantly changing as humans breathe frequently and quickly, about 12 to 25 breaths per minute when at rest. Breathing in a mask, you expel high levels of carbon dioxide before quickly sucking in oxygen from the outside atmosphere into your mask.
Roy McKay, professor emeritus for environmental and public health sciences at University of Cincinnati, explained that sudden breathing changes within a mask can cause meters like the one in the video to display short ""peak"" values that are tracking a quick change in oxygen concentration. 
Kirsten Koehler, associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, agreed that the sensor could have been having a response to a rapid change in oxygen levels. She said that it takes about 10 seconds for a sensor to respond to a change in oxygen concentrations, which can’t keep up with human breathing.
In an article McKay is writing on the quick changes in carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations within N95 masks, he concludes that ""most healthy people are unaffected by these concentrations… however, some otherwise healthy people are more sensitive and find the concentrations uncomfortable and possibly cause headaches."" An N95 mask is designed to form a seal around the mouth and nose, so the only air entering the mask is through a filter. The CDC currently does not recommend the general public wears N95 masks.
That research is specifically on N95 masks, and doesn’t apply to thin surgical masks and cloth masks, which McKay assumes will have better oxygen concentrations because of their relaxed fit.
Our rating
In a video on Facebook, a man uses an air-quality monitor to prove that people are ""not getting enough oxygen"" while wearing masks.
While the sensor he used is probably showing a somewhat accurate reading, experts explained that this sensor can’t pick up on how the oxygen within the atmosphere of the mask changes with each breath. Unless you are using an N95 or sealed mask, you probably won’t experience dangerously low oxygen levels or get a headache from wearing a mask.

Hospitalizations were down from a week prior but flat the week before the claim.





See the sources for this fact-check




As tends to happen in Wisconsin politics these days, the battle over re-opening the state is headed to the courts.
The state’s Republican-led Legislature filed suit April 21, 2020, asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to stop Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration from extending the stay-at-home order into late May. 
Evers had issued a ""Safer at Home"" order March 24, 2020, that restricted movement and business activity throughout the state through April 24. On April 16 that order was extended to May 26, 2020, this time signed by Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald made their case for an injunction blocking Palm in a joint statement released the same day as the lawsuit. After referencing ""public outcry"" and condemning Evers for ""unprecedented administrative overreach,"" the three-paragraph statement ends with this:
""The constant stream of executive orders … are eroding both the economy and their liberty even as the state is clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections.""
We’ll leave the determinations on scope of authority to the courts, but the last bit of that is clearly a data-based claim.
Are infections ""clearly"" on the decline in Wisconsin?
Metrics are largely flat, not declining
At the time of the joint statement, COVID-19 had resulted in 242 deaths in Wisconsin, with 4,620 people testing positive for the disease.
Kit Beyer, a spokeswoman for Vos, said the decline claim was based on hospitalization data and the hospital resource usage estimated in a model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.
The oft-cited model, last updated April 17, projected Wisconsin’s peak resource usage to be somewhere between April 10 and April 18. It’s an estimate based on their formula, not a firm calculation based on actual figures. The model has drawn some criticism for its methodology, which experts say could make it ill-suited to help determine when to ease social distancing restrictions.
In any case, it doesn’t make much sense to rely on a predictive model when we have actual data to examine for Wisconsin. 
So we’ll do that, starting with the hospitalization numbers Beyer cited.

HOSPITALIZATIONS
This is the lone metric that shows a decline over the last couple weeks.
After rising to start the month, the daily tally leveled off around 440 per day from April 9 to 14.
The number then dropped for two days before holding steady between 357 and 361 from April 17 to 21.
CONFIRMED CASES
The daily numbers move up and down a bit but have stayed largely consistent throughout April.
Zooming in to the last six days (April 15 to 20), Wisconsin had between 147 and 170 new confirmed cases per day. The tally was lower the days before that due to a lower number of tests being performed.
The most recent tally released prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald was April 20, with 153 cases, up six from the day before. That’s on par with the April average of 157 new cases per day.
DEATHS
Wisconsin has averaged 10.7 coronavirus deaths per day throughout April, with daily tallies ranging from six to 19.
The week prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald, Wisconsin averaged 10.9 deaths, including 10 on April 20.

Not in the way Trump described it. Many labs exist, but it’s not yet clear they have the capacity and equipment needed to do the job.
Trying to find the labs
We asked the White House for the data to back up Trump’s assertion about hundreds of labs, but the press office declined to comment and did not provide the list Trump referenced. A spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department said it couldn’t provide a tally of these untapped labs.
The spokesperson there did point to the Food and Drug Administration, which lists 109 labs nationwide that are already offering COVID-19 testing. The FDA also has a separate list of labs that are processing tests under emergency authorization. That adds 18 for a total of 127. 
But Trump was describing labs that could conduct tests, not ones that already were.
White House press staff provided an image of a map that included any lab that had equipment for identifying the genetic sequence of a virus. The image quality was too low for counting each dot. But Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, and chair of the National Governors Association, said that not only were many on the list already known to officials in his state, they had reached out to them before.

""We’ve been trying for over a month to get access to use labs, like at National Institutes of Health, with no success,"" Hogan said in an April 21 interview with MSNBC.
 
What makes a lab ‘ready’?
Even if the labs exist and are willing, it could be challenging to harness the capacity of new facilities identified by the White House in the anti-coronavirus fight.

Emails show ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""

That’s because all these labs are outfitted for the work they do in non-COVID scenarios, whether in defense, agriculture, basic research, or some other area. Each lab has testing equipment designed to meet those particular needs. Testing experts say it’s unrealistic to expect that each of these labs is able to analyze any specimen it receives.
""Just because the machine exists, you can't will it to work,"" said Scott Becker,  Association of Public Health Laboratories chief executive officer. ""You can’t just show up with a sample, plug it in and expect it to work.""
Louise Serio, spokeswoman for the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a trade group that includes the largest commercial labs, echoed the point that much depends on the kind of equipment — or ""platform"" — the lab has.
Test kits vary. They can contain different materials for a different range of steps in the process, and some are more complete than others. They are not interchangeable.
""For a lab to run a manufacturer’s test kit on a platform, the materials have to match up — the test kit and the platform must be from the same manufacturer,"" Serio said.
Part of the challenge of using any lab is that testing is a three-step process. 


It starts by collecting the specimen with a swab, preserving it in a stable medium for transport, and doing all the data entry that clearly ties that particular specimen to the patient it came from.


At the lab, the RNA from the specimen is extracted and amplified so that it can be identified in a testing machine. 


Then the results are reviewed and shared with health care providers and public health departments.


The first two steps are vulnerable to supply shortages — especially of the nasal swabs used to collect patient samples and the chemicals referred to as ""reagents"" that are needed to study them. States have been competing against each other and Washington for the same limited supply of essential goods, a situation that has become one of the primary constraints on testing in the U.S.
At the April 20 press conference, Vice President Mike Pence said a team at Walter Reed Medical Center was calling the labs on the list to see what they would need in order to help meet testing needs.
That outreach suggests that the government is still learning which labs are able to work with the states.
Our ruling
Trump said he had a list with hundreds and hundreds of labs ""ready"" and ""able"" to provide coronavirus testing. The White House declined to provide the list, and the Health and Human Services Department did not provide a tally.
The closest we found was a FDA list of about 130 labs nationwide. 
The people who work with testing said that simply possessing the laboratory equipment to process tests is insufficient to pull off the assignment. The vice president described how the government was still in the process of learning which labs could do what.
The labs exist, but the ready and able piece is a work in progress.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded research into invisible ink technology that could accompany vaccines to strengthen vaccination record-keeping in developing countries.


MIT began its research in July 2016, years before the first cases of the novel coronavirus emerged.


There’s no evidence Bill Gates is pushing for tracking bracelets, or that the MIT research has anything to do with “tracking Americans” amid the pandemic.

If living through a pandemic doesn’t already make you feel like you’re walking around in a brave, new world, then conspiratorial social media posts about the global outbreak may push you to the brink.
According to a claim we spotted on Instagram and beyond, Bill Gates ""is pushing"" an effort during the current outbreak to track Americans using bracelets and invisible tattoos that would be delivered alongside a vaccine. 
The theory also insinuates the project came along ""days"" after Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, stepped down from the company’s board of directors.
The post reads: 
""Bill Gates and other globalists, in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, are reportedly working to push tracking bracelets and ‘invisible tattoos’ to monitor Americans during an impending lockdown. MIT and Gates have ‘created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside the vaccine itself, and it’s only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter.’ This comes days after Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund research into increased vaccine tracking, especially in under-resourced communities, but this post makes unsupported assertions and distorts the timeline of that research.
Let’s take a look.
‘Invisible tattoos’ 
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are seeking to address vaccine tracking challenges in developing countries by creating an invisible ink that could be injected into children along with vaccines.
The study began in July 2016, MIT told us, more than three years before the first novel coronavirus cases emerged. It was not inspired by the current outbreak.
The idea behind the research is that the dye would be visible under near-infrared light for up to five years and provide a quick, affordable way of helping health providers keep track of a child’s vaccinations, even when paperwork gets lost or parents forget whether their child is up to date.
The dye wouldn’t monitor people’s habits or movements, as the Instagram post implies. It would essentially be a marker to see if someone received a vaccine upon inspection by a medical official.

RELATED: Bill Gates warned in 2015 that we were unprepared for an infectious virus 

Researchers say accurate vaccine record-keeping remains a major challenge in low-resource areas around the world, where ""well-maintained centralized databases do not exist,"" which ""contributes to 1.5 million vaccine-preventable deaths annually."" Scientists hope an invisible, embeddable medical record that could accompany vaccines could help solve that problem.

Says the U.S. government caused the coronavirus pandemic because it sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to university researchers weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak.












By Samantha Putterman • June 25, 2021







The Gates Foundation has contributed funds for this research.
‘Tracking bracelets’
Some governments such as Hong Kong are using electronic wristbands to track people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in order to enforce quarantines and reduce the spread of the virus.
But we find no evidence in news archives or other internet searches that Gates specifically stated he is ""pushing"" or advocating for the development of tracking bracelets.
The only mention of ""bracelets"" we could find associated with Gates came about in 2012, when the Gates Foundation funded a study into bracelets that would measure student engagement in classrooms. 
That said, Gates has said he supports the idea of a national tracking system to monitor the virus that causes COVID-19.
In a March 18 Ask Me Anything session on Reddit, Gates lauded South Korea’s tracking system, which  uses a smartphone app to gather information about COVID-19 spread. He said that, although thousands of tests are being offered per day at the University of Washington in Seattle, for example, ""no one is connected to a national tracking system"" and that ""whenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing.""
When did Gates’ interest in vaccination tracking begin? 
Gates has been interested in vaccinations and vaccination tracking, particularly in low-resource areas, for several years.
He stepped down from Microsoft’s board of directors on March 13, 2020. And, as we mentioned, MIT’s research into a vaccination-related invisible ink program has been going on for several years as well. 
MIT published a study on its research on Dec. 18, 2019, in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The research was submitted to the journal in July 2019, and an MIT spokesperson told PolitiFact that it began back in 2016 — years before the first cases of the virus were reported.
The Gates Foundation told PolitiFact that it awarded a grant to MIT to improve the way childhood vaccinations are tracked; it had nothing to do with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. Additional funding also came from the National Cancer Institute. 
""The researchers are exploring storing data in a pattern of dye, invisible to the naked eye, that is delivered under the skin at the same time as the vaccine. The technology is currently in the proof-of-concept phase,"" the foundation told PolitiFact in an email. ""If successful, governments could elect to incorporate this kind of tool in their immunization programs in place of, or in addition to, their current methods of tracking vaccinations.""
None of the research is specific to America, as the Instagram post suggests. Nor is it tied specifically to COVID-19.
Our ruling
An online post says that Bill Gates is pushing tracking bracelets and invisible tattoos to monitor Americans during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
We find no evidence that Gates has supported the concept of ""tracking bracelets."" His foundation awarded a grant to MIT to study invisible dyes that could accompany vaccines to keep track of vaccinations in developing countries.
But this research began in 2016, and there is no evidence that it has anything to do with the current coronavirus pandemic, or to ""monitor"" Americans specifically.

Joe Biden","Biden mischaracterizes teacher layoffs from pandemic




If Your Time is short





Joe Biden conflated teacher layoffs due to the coronavirus pandemic with the decline in local government education jobs between March and October.


Not all 666,000 local government education jobs lost were the result of layoffs, and not all of them involved teachers. The pandemic has also hurt school support staff.


We don’t know how many teachers have been laid off since the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., or how many will be laid off going forward.





See the sources for this fact-check




Speaking about the economic toll facing public schools, President-elect Joe Biden overstated the number of teachers who have been laid off since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
""There’s already a circumstance where nationwide, because of the requirement of school districts, county offices, mayors, governors having to balance their budgets, they’ve already had to lay off 666,000 teachers,"" Biden said Nov. 18 during a virtual event with frontline workers. 
""666,000 teachers have been laid off already since March,"" he repeated.

Biden is right that the pandemic has challenged public schools. Many teachers are at high risk for severe illness due to COVID-19, and many school districts are strapped for funds as they try to balance their budgets without more assistance from the federal government.
But the former vice president’s assertion that schools have laid off 666,000 teachers since March is inflated. The number he cited refers to the roughly 666,000 local government education jobs that went away between March and October, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Not all of those workers were teachers, and not all of them were laid off.
The Biden team did not respond to requests for comment.
Not all school staff are teachers
The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data that shows net changes in the number of people employed in an industry from month to month.
For ""local government education,"" an industry that primarily consists of jobs in public K-12 schools, the data shows that the number of workers dropped from 8,041,600 in March to 7,375,800 in October. That’s a net loss of about 665,800 workers. Between February and October, the decline was about 666,200 workers. 
The latter number — 666,200 — was cited in a Nov. 10 report by Pew Charitable Trusts. But Pew described the figure accurately as a net decrease in local government education jobs. 
""Those aren’t necessarily going to be teachers,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute who has written about public education job losses in the pandemic.

By Ciara O'Rourke • June 2, 2021







A BLS spokesperson said industries such as local government education can contain hundreds of different occupations, from librarians and coaches to administrators and custodial or cafeteria employees. The agency doesn’t collect data that would show job losses just among teachers.
In 2019, non-instructional staffers accounted for roughly 30% of all full-time equivalent jobs in public elementary and secondary schools, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Net change versus layoffs
The second problem with Biden’s claim is that the 666,000 lost jobs are not all attributable to layoffs. Experts said there’s no data source to show a precise count of how many teachers have been laid off since the start of the pandemic.

First grade teacher Megan Garner-Jones teaches students participating remotely and in person during the pandemic at School 16 on Oct. 20, 2020, in Yonkers, N.Y. (AP)
The BLS does track the number of layoffs and discharges by industry each month. But it lumps together data for local government education with state government education, which includes public colleges and universities. 
Faced with the health threat of COVID-19, reports show some teachers have also quit, taken leaves of absence or retired. A survey of educators that Education Week conducted in July found many teachers saying they were likely to leave their jobs this year due to the pandemic, although the outlet reported recently that it’s unclear how many actually stepped away.
One reason why there haven’t been more teachers laid off is that public sector layoffs often lag when recessions hit, said Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality. Another reason is that many school districts are bound by contracts and laws that restrict when teachers can be notified of layoffs.
Experts expect more layoffs to hit teachers the longer the recession drags on. 
Our ruling
Biden said, ""666,000 teachers have been laid off already since March.""
The 666,000 figure comes from federal data, but it doesn’t describe teacher layoffs. We don’t actually know how many teachers have been laid off due to the pandemic.
The 666,000 number reflects the net decrease in local government education jobs since March, but it’s not specific to teachers or job losses due to layoffs. It includes job losses by other school staff, such as cafeteria and custodial workers.

Coronavirus







Facebook posts","No, Sweden is not faring the same as its locked down neighbors




If Your Time is short




It goes too far to say Sweden has no lockdown in response to COVID-19. Sweden’s recommendations aren’t as strict as Norway’s and Denmark’s, but it is recommending social distancing. 

The rate of confirmed coronavirus cases is rising faster in Sweden than in Norway and Denmark, and Sweden has a higher death rate.


Differences such as how much testing is being done from one country to another can make comparisons difficult.





See the sources for this fact-check





Attacked by the coronavirus, superpowers such as the United States retreated into lockdown, deeming it the smartest way to stop the spread of the disease.
Sweden, which hasn’t been in a shooting war in two centuries, faced the enemy by arming its citizens mostly with guidelines, not stay-at-home orders.
That strategy, according to a widely circulated Facebook post, has been as effective as the shutdown policy adopted by two of Sweden’s neighbors.   
""Sweden has zero lockdown"" but ""is in no worse shape than Denmark or Norway, which are currently experiencing full lockdown,"" the post claims.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
On key data points, each of which has limitations, Sweden is faring worse than Denmark and Norway.
The Swedish approach
Sweden has a population of 10 million people, nearly nine out of 10 of whom live in urban areas. As we reported in a fact-check comparing Sweden with Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, Sweden has imposed no lockdown and no quarantines, although gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Elementary schools, bars, restaurants and businesses are still open, though with social distancing and other safety measures encouraged. What’s happening in Sweden seems like something closer to life as most Americans remember it before much of the country was shut down.
The idea in Sweden is to essentially pursue herd immunity — let the virus spread as slowly as possible while sheltering the elderly and the vulnerable until much of the population becomes naturally immune, or a vaccine becomes available.
In contrast, Denmark and Norway closed their restaurants and ski slopes and told all students to stay home. Norway required most people returning from abroad to enter a two-week quarantine and limited groups outdoors to no more than five people. Denmark closed its borders, sent public workers home with pay and encouraged all other employees to work from home. 
Comparing the COVID numbers
Here are some of the major metrics on how Sweden (which also borders Finland) compares with Denmark and Norway. We’re including the United States for informational value.
The figures are from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, who is director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford. 
All data are as of April 19, the date of the Facebook post.
Confirmed infection rate: Sweden rising faster
Sweden has a higher confirmed infection rate than Denmark and Norway. The measure is the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people.
United States: 2,220.79
Sweden: 1,368.61
Norway: 1,288.27
Denmark: 1,250.3
The differences among Sweden, Norway and Denmark are not significant, Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told PolitiFact.
But the total number of confirmed cases is increasing faster in Sweden than in Norway and Denmark — even though Sweden is doing less testing per 1,000 people than Norway and Denmark.
Anders Tegnell, the epidemiologist who is credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy, says infection rate is an unreliable measure of how a country is doing.

stated on June 2, 2021 in an Instagram post








An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.












By Tom Kertscher • June 2, 2021







""The recorded infection rate depends hugely on the number of tests performed and what indications for testing that are used,"" Tegnell, the director of the Swedish Public Health Agency, told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check. 
Helen Jenkins, a Boston University professor of biostatistics, also told us she wouldn’t rely on that measure because of how much testing varies among countries.
Death rates: Sweden higher
One way to compare COVID-19 deaths is the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases. Sweden’s is more than twice as high as Denmark’s and more than five times higher than Norway’s.
Sweden: 10.93% 
United States: 5.29%
Denmark: 4.78%
Norway: 2.12%
Even though this case fatality rate is commonly discussed, during an outbreak it is a poor measure of the true risk of death, Our World in Data says. That’s because the rate relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed. And it relies on the total number of deaths; and with COVID-19, some people who are sick will die soon but have not yet died. 
Another measure is COVID-19 deaths per million people. Again, Sweden’s is higher than Denmark’s and Norway’s.
Sweden: 149.61
United States: 117.55
Denmark: 59.74
Norway: 27.3
This per-capita death rate ""is a better measure of the severity of the issue,"" Kates said. Per capita case rates may, or may not, include everyone who needs to be tested, but not everyone who gets infected will get sick or die, she said. And deaths reported are less dependent on testing capacity than cases.
Tegnell has said Sweden’s death toll ""is not a failure for the overall strategy,"" but rather ""a failure to protect our elderly who live in care homes.""
A view from one Stockholm resident
Overall, Jenkins cautioned against drawing conclusions on comparing the three countries, given that the outbreak is still unfolding. 
""This is not over yet; in fact, it’s just starting,"" she told PolitiFact. ""Hard to judge the full impact of lockdown or not right at the moment."" 
Another expert, Paul Franks, a genetic-epidemiology professor at Lund University in Sweden, wrote on April 23 that studies indicate that ""we should soon expect infections and deaths in Stockholm,"" Sweden’s largest city, ""to drop substantially in the coming weeks."" 
Peter Callerfelt, 43, who owns a recruiting consulting business in Stockholm, said he believes it’s too soon to judge Sweden’s policy. He appreciates that he and his wife can still commute to their offices, where they are almost completely isolated from co-workers, and that their daughter can still go to kindergarten.
Callerfelt told PolitiFact that Sweden's policy is set by the country's health experts, not elected officials, and that citizens respond to the experts' recommendations. He wonders whether people in Norway and Denmark would comply with a second shutdown if their countries reopened and then the virus reappeared, whereas Sweden has more flexibility.
""If this is not enough, you can still have the ace left and say, OK, now we’re doing a total lockdown. In the other countries, they have nothing left to play,"" Callerfelt said.
Our ruling
A Facebook post claims that amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden has no lockdown and ""is in no worse shape than Denmark or Norway,"" which are in lockdown.
It goes too far to say Sweden has no lockdown, in that gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited. 
The claim has an element of truth in that Sweden has roughly the same number of confirmed cases per million people as Denmark and Norway. But it’s misleading to say that Sweden is doing no worse. The total number of confirmed cases is increasing at a faster rate in Sweden than in Norway and Denmark — even though Sweden is doing less testing per 1,000 people than Norway and Denmark. Moreover, Sweden has higher death rates.
